It's probably just as well that I'm tragically late to the party, because this a) is a crossover that was in no way requested and b) focuses on all the wrong things.  That said, the prompt did inspire me, and even though I pretty much failed at writing a fill, there it is.  Apologies all around.  A note about Mycroft in this story- you can look at it now if you’re interested in my somewhat lengthy ruminations about this AU, or you can come back and read it later if, after or in the midst of reading, you find yourself angry about him and want to know what the hell I think I’m up to.  That said, I do want to establish at the outset that Sherlock is Mycroft’s soulmate here.  I’m not portraying it as romantic (though you're free to read it however you please), but if you have any reason to believe that it might bother you regardless of my efforts, steer clear.  Finally, I'm American and this isn't Brit-picked.

True, Mycroft hadn’t given Q a lot of choice in the matter- but it was just as accurate to say that Q hadn’t given Q a lot of choice in the matter. He’d always thought of himself as the good younger brother, but in the end he’d gotten himself into more trouble than three Sherlocks combined, and in the end Mycroft hadn’t even had to ask. Q had been locked up in a little cell and when Mycroft came to visit him Q had seen Mycroft looking at him the way he used to look at Sherlock- like he was only a few steps away but there was still a wall between them too high to scale. Q hadn’t thought about it for more than a heartbeat before getting down on his knees, kissing his brother’s hand and swearing to do everything Mycroft asked from then on.After that, everything had happened… not quickly, exactly, but with all the simple and inevitable precision of a line of dominos coming down one after the other. After that, if there was ever a moment when Q had had the chance to put his hand up and say, “Wait a minute, what about my happily ever after?” it had passed him by unnoticed.But if he had gotten the chance, Q would never have said those words, and that probably was Mycroft’s fault- or perhaps it was the universe’s fault, through Mycroft. Q wasn’t sure.Young people tended to grow up with… a somewhat inflated notion of what it was to have a soulmate. When they were very small, marriage was a barely understood concept, children popped into existence as if by magic and sex was nowhere on their radar. Given that, what could it be but a fairy tale, to know that written right over their hearts was the name of the person they would love all their life? The person who would give that life such meaning?Q as a boy had had no such luxury. His elder brother, who he loved fiercely, would come home from school whenever possible, and Q would spend nearly every waking moment with him. Sherlock, a few years older than Q, would be sullen and cold and avoid him completely. Mummy insisted that most boys Sherlock’s age were the way, that he resented Mycroft for going away and would grow out of it eventually. But Mycroft would gaze after Sherlock with such misery in his eyes that Q would hate him just a little.Mycroft coming home was like the sun coming from behind the clouds. Q adored him, and as such grew up putting little faith in the system that made him so relentlessly unhappy. A long time ago- in less… enlightened eras- they burned people like Mycroft at the stake, on the premise that they unfailingly went mad and usually took a lot of people down with them when they did. These days, they recruited them out of school into shadowy and blood soaked work on the premise that that knife’s edge of pain in them that no soulmate would ever dull might as well be used to savage enemies of the state. It wasn’t that Mycroft didn’t have a soul mate- though people like that existed too and had been even more reviled in ages past- it was that the name written on his skin belonged to someone who had another name altogether written on his. Mycroft had always said it was just as well, and Q had tried to believe him, but it wasn’t until he was older that he did. To a young person, a soulmate meant little more than completeness and finding someone who would always love them- and in that regard it was most decidedly not just as well, because Mycroft loved and wanted to be loved as fiercely as anyone in the world. But, though there were platonic soulmates, it generally also meant sex, passion. As an adult, Q would come to understand that Mycroft thought those things were boring and messy respectively, and had neither the time nor the interest for either.But, as a boy, all that had been on Q’s periphery, and all he really knew was that having found- having never, ultimately, had to look for- his soulmate had never made Mycroft particularly happy, and in fact tended to do the opposite on a regular basis.As a boy, Q had decided that he wanted nothing whatsoever do with soulmates.On the Christmas holidays, he would sit with Mycroft by the fire, resting his head on Mycroft’s chest where Sherlock Holmes curled in a little spiral over his heart and say, “I wish that was my name. I’d never treat you like he does.” Mycroft, carding his fingers through Q’s hair, would hum sympathetically, as if Q was the one suffering.Mycroft would say, “You do know that- hmm. You do know that it doesn’t mean I don’t love you, don’t you?”“Yes,” Q would say immediately, because he had never, ever doubted that.“I like to think it doesn’t refer to Sherlock specifically- not really. I like to think it just means that I love my family so much that I don’t need anything else.” But then, in later years, when Sherlock was self-destructing and drugs weren’t even his worst vice, Q had known it was about more than family. He had known that sometimes keeping Sherlock safe was more an obsession with Mycroft than a love as most people experienced it. He had known that, for all his intelligence, Mycroft didn’t always know himself that well.But he’d also hated the society he lived in for having ever treated Mycroft and those like him with suspicion and disgust, for insisting that there was something inherently wrong with them. He had concluded that it was the proudest, bravest thing a person could achieve, to love without expecting or receiving anything in return, to guard and protect and make peace with the knowledge that he would never himself be guarded or protected.And then Q fell into his own period of trouble, and when he did that had been rather like a line of dominoes as well. It had started with a bit of showing off to what he thought were likeminded people and ended with being branded a cyber terrorist and locked in a tiny cell. When Mycroft put it to him that he could stay in that cell for the rest of his life or give up his name and everything his name entailed and work for the government, it hadn’t really been much of a choice. But at the same time, it had also felt like a culmination of everything that had been in his head since he was a boy. If Mycroft could live without Sherlock when Sherlock was right there, then Q could most certainly live without James Bond, whoever he was, when he’d never so much as met the man. He could put his love and his passion into serving his country and that would be that.He gave up his name and trained himself to think as Q the Quartermaster and no one else. He came up with a rather convoluted method by which he could make contact with his brothers with no possibility of being detected, but it was understood that he would only use it in the direst emergencies.   Thus, he only saw Mycroft when they were both in their official capacities, and he never saw Sherlock at all, except through a CCTV camera.Q’s old self vanished like so much smoke, and he sometimes thought that if he made an instant connection with a man on a bus or in a coffee shop- as one did in romantic films- and that man asked, hope shining in his eyes, if his name happened to be Sherrinford Holmes, he would say, “No, I’m sorry.   You’re looking for someone else,” and actually rather believe it was true.      But, of course, that wasn’t how it happened. Not at all.    *   *   *“How are you settling in?”“Quite well, Mr. Tanner, thank you,” Q said. He was bent over a tiny communications device and less than overjoyed to have been interrupted, but he found Tanner an efficient, largely unobnoxious sort of man and had no desire to treat him unkindly. Beyond that, it was Q’s first week in charge of Q-Branch and he knew better than to kick it off by alienating M’s right hand man. “Do you have work for me?”Tanner didn’t seem to find the jump to work-talk rude, luckily- in fact, it seemed to please him. “Always, Quartermaster,” he replied. “It’s for 007.”“Ah,” Q returned. “The famous 007.”“You’ve heard of him?”“One hears of little else in Q-Branch.""  Plenty of Q's little worker bees had been here for years. Pleasantly, none of them had given any sign of resenting having someone so new- so young- put in charge. Less pleasantly, all of them were most enamored of a certain agent notorious for never bringing his equipment back in good condition. Notorious, in point of fact, for rarely bringing it back at all. “What will he require?”Tanner handed over a file with basic notes on the mission and what equipment the analysts had determined would be of use. “As you can see there’s plenty of leeway for your own judgment,” Tanner said. “As promised.”“Yes,” Q agreed absently, already half in his own world. A gun- how pedestrian. Still, even that technology could be improved upon and even if he lost it- when he lost it- 007 would make as fair a test subject as any. Even so, he did note Tanner- still there- out of the corner of his eye, and he did note the curiosity in his expression. Somewhat reluctantly, Q returned his attention to the other man. “What is it?”“Nothing,” Tanner said. “You’re a bit of a mystery man, is all.”“Yes,” Q said again, at a loss for anything else. Most everyone had a codename at MI6 and truly comprehensive files on anyone were difficult come by, but even M knew almost nothing about Q. He was young, he had seemingly come from nowhere, and people at the highest levels had been instructed from higher levels still to give him whatever he wanted. There was nothing Q could do to help solve the mystery, of course- not even if he wanted to, and he didn’t especially.“Don’t worry,” Tanner told him, as if he knew what Q had been thinking. “One gets used to not knowing everything.” There was a wryness in his tone, as if he wished one didn’t have to.“That’s true,” Q replied. “I’ll need access to 007’s personal information- his medical history and so forth.”Again there was curiosity in Tanner’s eyes, but this time nothing came of it. “Of course.” With a final nod in Q’s direction, he departed, and Q found himself with the correct access codes forthwith. Q had a certain tunnel vision with it came to his inventions, and all he really cared to know was where he could find enough of the man’s genetic information for his purposes, but even he couldn’t fail to notice- at long last- 007’s name.Q stared at the screen. “Bugger.”*   *   *Had it been purposeful, Q might have taken pride in the poor impression he made on James Bond when they finally met. As it was, Q rather agonized about the nonsense he’d spouted whenever he had a free moment. It was just as well, of course- it wasn’t as though it was important that he dazzle the man with his philosophical prowess; they weren’t going to be spouses or lovers. They weren’t even going to be friends. They were going to be colleagues, and Q wasn’t going to let the name written over his heart disrupt that.Of course, it wasn’t long after they met that 007 almost died. Again. Several times, in fact. And Q gathered from Eve that he had very almost died before they met as well. And every time it happened, Q felt as if he heart had frozen in his chest and didn’t know what anything was worth if he couldn’t even touch that man before he lost him. He thought about the fact that Bond’s luck would run out sooner or later, and what then? When he’d made his peace with never knowing his soulmate- when he’d thought he’d made his peace with never knowing his soulmate- he had been operating under the assumption that he would never meet him, never work with him. Never exchange barbed words with him or see his mouth twitch with annoyance or his eyes glint with amusement. Never watch him die on a tiny computer screen and have to hide the pain in his own chest when his soulmate’s heart stopped.Q knew that pain intimately, of course. He had felt it before- more than once- and could now trace the incidents through 007’s file. Oh, to have been matched with an accountant somewhere, Q would absently think as Bond crushed an extremely expensive communications device under his heel and took a woman with this or that piece of information to bed.“If she stabs him,” Q would observe through gritted teeth. “It’ll serve him right.”“Are you worried about him?” Eve would ask, amused.“I’m a worrier,” he would say blithely, and though it wasn’t true- that was his big brother- he grew fond of all the Double-O’s in his way, and made an excellent approximation of it.*   *   *“Did medical clear you to come to Q Branch?” The only reply Q received was a disconcerting silence from where 007 sat in the chair beside his desk. “Did you even go to medical?” More silence. “Go to medical, for God’s sake!”“No.”“Bond.”“No.”They were briefly at an impasse. After a moment, Q conceded defeat with his usual mixture of sullenness and grace. He rolled his eyes and said, “You Double-O’s are going to be the death of me,” but even though he’d only been in the job a few months he already knew it was just Bond. It would always, always be Bond. Q glared unhappily at Bond’s exceedingly well-formed chest. There were people in the world who as adults never took off their shirts except in the presence of their soulmate. Of course Bond wouldn’t be like that. Q had trouble tearing his eyes away from the scar tissue that had been left behind when Eve shot Bond before and made Q- back in England all unaware- nearly run his car off the road. Of course, Bond didn’t need his shirt off for this, so it was his own fault if Q stared. “Put your shirt back on,” Q said. He was being distracted from what was important.“Those are the very last words I’d ever hoped to hear from you,” Bond quipped. He didn’t put his shirt back on.    Q didn’t say, ‘How can you flirt at a time like this?’ He excused not speaking to himself by saying that it would have dignified the remark, but in truth he didn’t trust his voice. He knew exactly how Bond could flirt at a time like this- doubtless it was the same strange infatuation that currently warmed the pit of Q’s stomach even as he wanted, desperately, to wring this man’s neck.“Don’t you want to take a look at the tracker they put in me?”“I disabled it the moment you were back on British soil.”“Yes,” Bond said, holding out his arm. “But I’m sure it’s of interest.” Q looked down at the limb in question. The device had been quite sloppily implanted. Q’s predecessor’s technique hadn’t been perfect, but it had hardly left a mark. The people who had held 007 captive, however, had put their tracker in with no finesse whatsoever. Though it was true that Q could learn a great deal about where those people had gotten their tech from the tracker, and possibly use it to find any stragglers besides, and also true that medical might damage it in their strange zeal to put ‘person’ before ‘tech’, Q thought that under the circumstances medical was best equipped to handle this one.He told Bond as much.The infuriating man batted his eyelashes. “Why, Quentin, I didn’t know you cared,” he cooed. “Come on,” he gestured with his arm again.“Do you like pain? Is that what this is about?”“Only in a controlled setting, and only if that’s what you like.” Bond leered. “But this- if you must know- is about science. I can take it.”“Which doesn’t necessarily mean that I should dish it out,” Q said, but he reached out anyway and somehow missed the mark entirely. “Oh,” Q murmured, staring at the place where his fingertips brushed over his once-name. Sherrinford Holmes stared back at him, somehow accusatory. It was different to see it- touch it- than to merely know it was there. Bond’s lack of shame notwithstanding, it was very taboo to touch someone’s mark as Q just had, even accidently. Too late to go unnoticed, Q snatched his hand away.Bond’s eyes glinted with inappropriate amusement. “It’s okay,” he said. “I don’t mind.”“I mind,” Q returned tartly. Since it was the closest thing to vengeance he could produce, Q did as Bond had suggested and removed the tracker with a device he’d designed for the purpose. A great deal more blood and tissue came away than was meant to. Q scowled, swabbed the wound with alcohol and Bond didn’t even wince. “You great masochist,” Q remarked.“Apparently,” Bond said, in a tone that didn’t seem to have anything whatsoever to do with how much his arm probably hurt.“Now- go to medical or I’ll call someone to drag you there.”“Right.”*   *   *The names appeared over a person’s heart with a tiny flash of pain around- sometimes a little while after- the time a person’s soulmate was born.Those with a substantial age difference between themselves and their soulmate had a difficult time of it- spending so long with no mark. There were people who waited half their lives and then, often after they’d given up on it entirely, doubled over as the name was etched on their skin. Those who never had a mark and never would often pretended to be waiting- but it was generally thought that those people knew in their hearts that the name would never come. Q didn’t know what such people knew, and he felt it best not to judge.Daddy was old enough when it happened to remember it, but he never could explain the feeling very well. He at least talked about it, though, which Mummy never did. Daddy would tell Q- Q being, as far as he knew, the only one to ask- about how lovely their mother was, and how amazed he had been to find that someone so brilliant, so different, was meant to be with someone as ordinary as him.Mummy didn’t talk about it at all. Sherlock and Q had been born in relatively close succession and so long after Mycroft that Q sometimes suspected she’d had two more children than she’d bargained for. Mummy was distant at times without meaning to be; she was intuitive, but never especially gifted at explaining what she knew. And given what all her children went through regarding soulmates at one point or another in their lives, perhaps it wasn’t so odd that she never broached the subject.  Like Mummy, Sherlock and Q were both born with the names already there, if too tiny to read.Mycroft’s manifested when he was seven, as the ink on little Sherlock’s birth certificate started to dry. As Daddy told the story to Q, Mummy had seen it sometime after they all came home from the hospital, and said nothing but, “Oh. My poor boy.”Possibly, that in itself explained a great deal about Mycroft Holmes.*   *   *“That man is going to be the death of me,” Q muttered to himself. He pulled off his headset- useless now that Bond’s corresponding ear comm was so much dust again- and tossed it aside in disgust. Bond hadn’t given any kind of distress signal, and Q hadn’t heard him being captured, so all he could do was wait for the agent to make contact in the traditional way.Nothing about this little scene was at all unusual; in fact, the missions where 007 didn’t pull this sort of move were exceedingly rare. What made today different was that Mycroft was there, doing one of his inspections. What, exactly, the inspections were about and who they were for even Q wasn’t cleared to know, and Mycroft was very serious about clearance. Privately, Q suspected they were on the order of one person- let’s call her… Lizzie.At any rate, M was currently holed up in his office with Tanner trying to find a way to make the fact that a) they’d lost Bond and b) that was actually a pretty common state of affairs, sound like anything other than an utter disaster.    No one was there, then, except for Q, Mycroft, and the underlings Q paid for their silence, so it didn’t really matter that Mycroft reached out, squeezed Q’s shoulder, and said, “Are you all right?” It didn’t really matter, except that Mycroft had seen something in Q that made him do that, despite the fact that they weren’t supposed to know each other at all. And that was a problem, because Q had nearly convinced himself that how he felt about Bond was very well hidden.Q shrugged, and managed to keep himself from resting his cheek on Mycroft’s hand.Somewhere across the room, a Q-Branch member hurriedly wrote something down.Q noticed and huffed out a laugh. “You should follow me home and really give them something to think about.”“You know that I will if you ask.”“I do,” Q said, though he hadn’t, completely, until he heard Mycroft’s voice just then. He didn’t quite understand it, and that left him itchy. Q hated not to understand.He’d given up his name, and with it his family, his soulmate, and everything else that that name made his. Q had known, of course- in the reason centers of his brain if not in his heart- that Mycroft wouldn’t be able to just turn it off, caring about him. But at the same time, no one turned off feelings like Mycroft. If anyone could make it so he no longer had a brother on paper and just as easily make it so he no longer had a brother in his heart, it would be- Q always thought- Mycroft Holmes.But it was perfectly obvious in that moment that his brother hadn’t stopped caring. Looking at Mycroft in that moment, Q could see that Mycroft could- and would- sooner stop breathing than stop caring about him.  “Do what?” Mycroft asked gently, hand not leaving Q’s shoulder. His face had softened almost imperceptibly, and there were traces of bitterness, as if he knew what Q had seen and was perhaps acutely aware of the fact that it had been a revelation. “Know? Or want me to follow you?”Suddenly Q had to swallow around a lump in his throat. “Know. Anything else would be… unwise.”“Unwise,” Mycroft repeated, and sighed. “Yes.”Q wanted to turn and throw his arms around Mycroft, but there was a difference between occasionally tossing a tidbit to the bored members of Q-Branch and totally rewriting their understanding of the world. “I’ll be all right,” he said. “I’m not going to fall apart over one missing Double-O.”“No,” Mycroft agreed, though he sounded even less sure than he had before. Q wondered if Mycroft knew that, despite Q’s best efforts, Bond was so much more than one missing Double-O.He thought, Of course he knows. But it didn’t change anything.*   *   *Bond didn’t die, of course.He finally made contact about an hour after M first started talking about writing him off- like he knew exactly what had been going on in MI6 HQ- and then returned a couple of days later towards the end of Q’s shift with a mangled bit of tech cradled in his hands like some kind of botched peace offering. It was the exact same thing he always did.“One day, I’ll have grey hairs,” Q told him, and it was the exact same thing he always said. “And they will all be your doing.”“And on that day, Quillian, you will look very distinguished.” Bond reached out, brushing a curl of not-yet-grey hair from Q’s forehead. “You look exhausted.”“I wonder why that should be.”“Let me offer you a drink as an apology?”“Go home, 007. I’m not the only one who looks exhausted.”“Let me offer you some very acrobatic no strings attached sex as an apology?”“Goodnight, 007.”That exchange, too, always happened- with a few amendments to the dialogue for Q’s insults and the specific nature of Bond’s flirting. Q started to get used to it, as he started to get used to most of Bond’s… eccentricities. Q supposed that was what made him crazy.*   *   *“He doesn’t look like an enemy of the state, Quincy.”“You haven’t learned that appearances can be deceiving yet, 007?” Q snapped his laptop closed on the face of his brother’s new flatmate and fixed Bond with a glare. “What you doing in my flat?”“Saying hello?”“A text or call would have done that admirably. A break-in rather speaks to… neediness.”“I’ve been driven mad by your cold and continued refusal?” Bond offered.“I cannot be the only person in the world to say no to you,” Q scoffed, though Bond’s expression didn’t exactly bolster his confidence in that regard. “I despair of humanity sometimes.”“So do I,” Bond said. “You haven’t offered me tea.”“Would you like some tea, 007?” Q sighed.“Ta very much. No cream or sugar.”Q rolled his eyes and went to get it started. Complaints aside, he didn’t completely hate it when Bond broke into his flat, provided the man wasn’t bleeding all over his furniture. Today Bond looked undamaged, and the bickering was something to do beyond stalking that strange little army doctor who was apparently the One for Sherlock. The game they played- he and James Bond- was entertaining in its way. Bond flirted, Q insulted, they both retreated, took stock, and sent forth another volley. It was… fun.But when Q handed Bond his cup and saucer their fingers brushed and Q knew that this was the sort of fun he couldn’t afford to have. Q needed to stop teasing the man and put his foot down. He just… didn’t know how. This sort of thing baffled him. It always had.So, he put it off until tomorrow, and when tomorrow came he would probably put it off again.    *   *   *When two soulmates met as teenagers, it was known was Romeo and Juliet syndrome in certain circles. In case that term isn’t evocative enough, it could be… messy. Combined with hormones and the sometimes incomprehensible politics of youth, finding one’s mate at that age didn’t typically end in sunshine and roses.That wasn’t to say that not finding one’s mate as a teenager was a picnic either. Sometimes all a person thought about during puberty was finding the One- and how much better things would be when they did. Young people dated, to be sure, and they agonized about what the point of it all could possibly be if that person wasn’t their match. It wasn’t until university that Q himself finally gave it a try. As a teenager, he buried his nose in a book and tried to wish it all away.  Natural intelligence aside, school- and the level of human interaction it required- wasn’t actually easy for any of the Holmes brothers.Mycroft, good at biting back any less than complimentary opinions of adults and making himself useful to his peers, handled it best. Mummy had tutored him herself from home before Sherlock was born, and he wasn’t enrolled in a school until Q followed along behind. Mycroft was never popular- he was pudgy, he loathed physical activity, he was too accustomed to having all the attention on him, and he could never completely hide the fact that he didn’t genuinely like anyone- but he was successful. His education looked pitch perfect on paper and no one ever said anything less than glowing about him. For Mycroft, that was all that really mattered.Sherlock… well- it hardly bore mentioning. He showed some aptitude for science, but even then he refused to do any work that he couldn’t see the point of, and there was ultimately very little work he could see the point of. He made ‘deductions’ that humiliated peers and instructors alike, and he ended up in screaming fights with fully grown adults.Thus, it wasn’t too odd that most people had awaited Q’s turn with some degree of apprehension. But Q was a good student, a nice boy. He wasn’t as good at manipulating his peers as Mycroft had been, so he was pushed around a fair amount, but he withdrew into his studies and never resented being disliked as Sherlock not-so-secretly did. He wasn’t as good at manipulating his teachers as Mycroft had been, either- but Q saw the real point of school in way neither of his brothers ultimately had, so though he never made a very substantial impression in either direction his work had spoken for itself.  But, of course, it wasn’t really the school part that made being those years so difficult for them, and for the younger two in particular.Between them, Q and Sherlock met enough Jameses and Johns to people a small country before they came of age. By the time Q started university, that name- James- would ring in his ears like a forever unscratchable itch. He didn’t know what it was like for Sherlock- he never asked- but his hopes turned to bitterness so very quickly in those days, as if less than two decades on the earth was plenty of time to find his mate if that mate was at all worth finding- but, in hindsight, it must’ve been worse for Sherlock somehow.Q never actually envied Mycroft- he was too smart for that- but he sometimes thought it must have been nice not to have a stake in the whole business. He never thought that for very long, of course- life had a way of reminding him that Mycroft did, in fact, have a stake.When he was nineteen, Sherlock tried to burn his soul mark off- insisting that, mark or no, he would never love anyone. Q gathered that the mark remained legible after the fact- though it might have only mattered symbolically if it hadn’t, as their whole family would remember the name John Watson as long as they lived, and it was unlikely that the man, whoever he was, would ever meet some other Sherlock Holmes- but Q never physically saw what Sherlock did to himself. He just remembered the fight Sherlock and Mycroft had after.He’d never known Mycroft to shout before- but people across the channel probably heard both of them that day.“What do you care?” Sherlock had snarled. “You want it gone!”“That’s not true,” Mycroft had bellowed back. Q had seen them standing closer than they ever had before, not touching, but near enough to share breath. Mycroft softened. “It’s not true,” he repeated quietly.Sherlock looked almost… stricken.“I just want you to be happy.”“I’m not.”“I know,” Mycroft returned, a world of pain in his eyes. “If I could fix it…” He raised a hand, as if to brush a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead, as he habitually and unthinkingly did with Q, and Sherlock flinched away. Mycroft jerked his hand back, and swallowed. “One day, perhaps once you meet him, you’ll feel better.”  “Will I?” Sherlock asked, broodingly.“Well, I wouldn’t exactly know, would I?” Mycroft snapped.Sherlock was a picture of shock and Q- forgotten in the corner of the room- couldn’t have looked much better, though they were undoubtedly reacting to different things. Sherlock probably couldn’t believe Mycroft had admitted to not knowing something. Q couldn’t believe that he’d actually spoken of his own situation. Q had never known Mycroft to utter a single reproach to Sherlock on the subject in all their lives.Mycroft’s expression contorted briefly, and he walked away. Q looked at Sherlock and couldn’t even begin to understand what he saw in his face. He didn’t try; he followed Mycroft to his room.By the time Q got there, Mycroft was curled up in his bed, back to the door. Q climbed in next to him, wrapping himself around Mycroft’s back. “Hey you,” Mycroft murmured, hands over Q’s hands. “I’m sorry you had to see that.” Though it had to sometimes be the case, Mycroft never looked at Q as though he wished he was Sherlock.“S’okay,” Q said, and just held on. He dozed for a while, but he would later remember hearing a sound in the doorway- a step and an unhappy huff- and feeling eyes on him.He would put that from his mind.*   *   *“If you think the tea and pastry in your hands will in any way make up for that watch you fed to a komodo dragon, you’ve got another thing coming, 007.”Something- the second cousin twice removed of a wince- happened on Bond’s face and was gone in a heartbeat. Somewhere, however, one of Q’s minions had made note of it and added it to an ongoing spreadsheet. Bond didn’t know about the spreadsheets, of course- and would have only made a lewd joke if he did- and so when he replied his face was clear and he was unaware that anything else had been catalogued. “It was an alligator that time, Quinlan,” Bond said.“Of course- how could I have ever confused the two?”And Bond smiled slightly and set his offering on Q’s worktable. “What have you got for me?” He peered over Q’s shoulder.“Nothing,” Q replied. “This is for 006. 006 is my favorite.”“Nonsense,” Bond said, annoyingly cheerful.Q rolled his eyes and put his work aside for a while. The tech was actually for 003, but the first few times Q had spoken fondly of 006- who Q knew was a particular friend of Bond’s, inasmuch as the man had friends- it had provoked something rather like jealousy. Unfortunately, Bond seemed to be on to him, and there was now not enough data to warrant another spreadsheet.He took a bite of his pastry, thanked Bond only a little resentfully, and waited to be left in peace. Bond stayed. “What do you want?” Q asked, mouth full.“I like watching you eat.” Bond did indeed look horribly affectionate. “You should let me take you to dinner. I know a little place-”“No.”“Hmm?”“No.”Bond tilted his head to one side. “Give me one good reason why you won’t have dinner with me.”Six immediately presented themselves. Three were moderately to extremely offensive and might do the trick of discouraging the man, but would suggest that Q had thought about it enough to come up with arguments, and that didn’t bear admitting. The fourth was the truth, and was therefore impossible. The fifth- that he had an engagement every night for the foreseeable future, or was in fact engaged- might not have the appropriate effect. Thus- “I don’t eat.”“You do.”“Prove it,” Q said, chewing again.“I like to think that I have,” Bond returned immediately. “But if dinner is out, a drink ought to be acceptable.”      “It isn’t.”“Why?”“Because-”It was inappropriate to be pleased when there was a major crisis and James Bond was needed halfway across the world forthwith, but Q definitely was.*   *   *The spreadsheets Q-Branch was working on noted a number of trends, the most profound of which being that the Quartermaster’s consistent rebuffing of his advances had only made 007 more determined to flirt his face off, rather than less. If ever a more unhelpful trend had been noted in Q-Branch, it had been before this Q’s time.Fractionally more useful was the following: James Bond joked when he was being tortured, and he could manufacture or mask more or less any emotion he pleased, but there were two things about Q that actively garnered a negative reaction:1. James Bond disliked that Q never called him ‘James’ and only rarely went so far as to call him ‘Bond’, preferring to say ‘007.’ Any annoyance he might have felt at Q’s suggested preference for other agents seemed to be tempered by the fact that Q also called them by their codenames.2. James Bond disliked that he himself knew Q only by that name or Quartermaster. As such, he called Q by a different name every day, hoping that- since the previous M’s title had corresponded to her real name- Q’s would do the same and he might eventually light on it.  The purpose of the spreadsheets, in Q’s opinion, was simple: Bond confused him, and any data had to demonstrate an improvement.Q’s initial bad impression on Bond hadn’t lasted, and all his subsequent efforts to compound it had failed. The man flirted with him constantly- over the comms, in Q’s office, in Q’s flat, and even occasionally in meetings. It was so horribly unprofessional that it would have driven Q crazy even if it wasn’t Bond doing it- then again, if it wasn’t Bond doing it, Q would’ve let him have his date long ago and dispensed with all this tension while it was still bearable. Q was a genius, true, and entirely capable of making all the exploding pens in the world should he take it into his head to do so- and he wouldn’t because they were tacky, not because it was his way of playing hard to get- but he wasn’t exactly interesting.The knowledge that if they did go to dinner Bond would quickly tire of the whole business was not as comforting as Q might wish it would be. In fact, it might have disappointed him a very little bit, which was nonsensical in the extreme.      Q knew perfectly well that Bond was no romantic. How else could he have fallen for- and who could ever doubt that he had loved Vesper Lynd?- a woman who had someone else’s name written over her heart? How could he have fallen for her when he himself did? People who had not yet met their soulmates, or whose mate had already died, did have… relations at times- but this was only for fun, relaxation. Those who fell in love easily waited, and did so quite cheerfully. Bond was clearly not the type to wait. If he thought at all about the name written over his heart, it was not evident.Sometimes, indeed, he acted very like the sort of person with no name written there at all and even though Q had seen it with his own eyes and touched it with his own fingers he still periodically checked old footage to see if it was really there. It always was, but Q still found himself certain that he was like Mycroft, matched to someone constitutionally incapable of returning the emotion.As if it mattered if he was. As if Q cared whether Bond could love him.*   *   *It was meant to be an easy recruitment assignment.Q was important- he was responsible for some of the most significant advancements the British Intelligence service had seen in decades, and though there were people in the higher echelons of power who thought of certain MI6 agents and assets as expendable, Q would not have been among them even if Mycroft Holmes hadn’t made it very clear to everyone who mattered that no harm was to come to him. But Mycroft Holmes had made it very clear indeed, which made it in turn even more unlikely- unlikely as it had already been- that Q would ever see any action.The point is that if anyone, anywhere, had had even the smallest reason to suspect that this meet and greet would end with Q bleeding on the concrete floor of a parking structure, it wouldn’t have happened.But, since it did happen, Q thought he could probably have been excused for not having a plan in place for the eventuality that he might die in the field while talking to 007 through an earpiece. He’d gone over it dozens- perhaps hundreds- of times the other way around, but as it was… Q had nothing to fall back on. Nothing at all.  “Isn’t this supposed to be the other way around?” Bond said, as if he had thought about it too. There was horrible tightness in his voice.“Well,” Q said, ignoring how similar their trains of thought had been, “I suppose that depends on how you think things are ‘supposed to be.’” Q wasn’t in a lot of pain at the moment, which he had an idea was a bad sign, but he had a great deal of difficulty focusing on anything- even Bond’s voice.“You won’t die,” Bond said. “You owe me that drink.”“Ha,” Q managed. “You forget- we were never going to have that drink.”“Sure we were. I’d have worn you down.”“Didn’t want you to wear me down.”“I know.” Bond sounded bizarrely sad, just then. Hurt, even. “That’s what I never got. We’d be good together. We… fit.”“That’s what you want to talk about?”“We have to talk about something until the rescue team gets to you, and I don’t know anything about tech.”“Such has been painfully obvious throughout our acquaintance.”Bond gave a strained laugh. “See? Witty banter. Don’t you like the witty banter?”“It seemed unlikely that we would lose it.”“True. But we could have had it in bed.” Bond sighed. “Everyone in Q branch told me you were sensitive on the subject, but I don’t get it.”“You asked Q branch how I felt about being propositioned?”“After the actual propositioning part fell flat, yes. Those that don’t think you’re secretly married to some posh guy in a suit warned me that it was a sore spot nevertheless, but… I have never flirted so hard in my life.”  “Your technique needs work.”“My technique is flawless. You need to lighten up.”“Don’t you care? At all? About-”“Is this about that name?” Bond asked. “You did react more strongly than I expected. The man might as well have died before I was born for all I know about him. What’s more, I don’t care if I ever know more. I do not believe in destiny, and I think God or whoever the hell is in charge of these things had no business deciding who I belong with and stamping their name on me for the rest of my life. I want to decide what I like, and it just so happens I like you. I just wanted that to be enough. I wanted to go for a drink, see where things went. I’m not exactly what you’d call a wonderful boyfriend, but I’m willing to bet that you aren’t either. You’ve been good for me and I thought maybe we could be good for each other. People make too much of these things.”“They do, don’t they?” Q murmured.“I thought… for a while there, I thought Vesper felt that way too. But she didn’t. Nobody does, I guess. But I thought you were different.”“There is something oddly romantic in that, 007. Sorry to disappoint.”“Don’t apologize- you-”“But I am sorry,” Q choked, and he was. Everything had gone so horribly wrong and it was quite impossible, suddenly, to see any good reason for it. “This is going to hurt. You don’t know- you have no idea…” Q recalled the last time it had happened- because it had happened with depressing regularity- and it seemed to him that he had hurt more then than he did now- now that he was actually dying. He murmured, remembering, “When your heart stops…”“It’s your heart stopping.”“Yes. But you’ll feel it. I always…”              *   *   *Q had always been reasonably self-sufficient, even before he was Q, and so it was easy enough to tell himself that he wasn’t… lonely. Sherlock would probably have seen the lie in that from one look at how Q had done his tie, though Q had no idea how. He was as smart as Sherlock- smarter, in his way- but the minutiae of human appearance and any conclusions one might draw from it had always escaped him.  All three of them had always had trouble relating to other people. All three of them coped with that feeling that they were aliens on their own planet in different ways: Mycroft by reducing everyone to tiny pieces in a giant puzzle, individual ants in the larger anthill of national and international politics that was his domain; Sherlock by turning them all into codes to be decoded, each little detail bringing him one step closer to knowing everything about them in one look; and Q by dispensing with other people altogether and burying himself in technology- because machines did what he wanted- they never talked back or lashed out, and if they malfunctioned they were easily fixed- and code never hurt anyone accidentally, not like people did.So he had always been isolated, even from his own family- a fact that, for some reason, didn’t make it any easier not to see them anymore when he became the Quartermaster.For all Q knew- he could never bring himself to ask- Mummy and Daddy thought he was dead. It was possible that there had even been a funeral. Sherlock probably knew the truth, and if he did Q doubted the knowledge that Mycroft had erased their little brother had warmed things between them in any way. As much as it pained him to imagine their relationship growing even more strained than it was there was nothing Q could do about any of it. That wasn’t his life anymore.  The job Mycroft had found for him was his life, and- in a way- Q-Branch did eventually become his family.A nosy, annoying little family.Q-Branch being like it was, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that they spied on each other occasionally. Or constantly, depending on how much leeway you want to give them. Since very few of them had what might be called a personal life, and those existed almost exclusively online, the files were generally pretty thin- metaphorically speaking, anyway, since most of the time they were digital, or even purely mental, in nature.Thus, one thing Q didn’t know about- or at least didn’t know  about at first, since very little ultimately went on in Q-Branch that he didn’t eventually find out about- were the other spreadsheets, the ones more on Q than Bond.There were spreadsheets about the things 007 did that made Q roll his eyes, smile a tiny smile he thought no one would see, or go white as a sheet and look like he was being shot at himself.There were also spreadsheets about the Man with the Umbrella.Most of Q-Branch was aware that the Man with the Umbrella was high on the food chain- so high no one was even allowed to ask who he was- and he visited rarely enough that the data on those spreadsheets was spotty at best, so Q-Branch had decided instead to supplement them by taking very extensive notes on the subject. They noted the way Q would try so hard not to smile whenever the Man with the Umbrella visited MI6, and fail completely. They noted the way the Man with the Umbrella’s eyes would crinkle fondly whenever Q had a new invention to show off. They noted the ease with which they followed each other’s ideas, and the fact that though neither of them was much given to displays of affection they sometimes casually touched without seeming to realize it.      Q gathered from the notes that most of Q-Branch, all the Double-O’s, and even Mycroft’s ex-Double-O personal assistant, had developed the impression that they were secret lovers- spouses, even. It didn’t help that Mycroft wore a ring on his right hand, and some intrepid agent had discovered- when Q fell asleep at his work station- that Q wore a matching ring on a chain around his neck. When Mycroft was in MI6 headquarters one day and Q mentioned his underlings’ conclusions to him, his mouth had quirked. “I suspected as much,” he smiled.It was just as well that Mycroft found it so amusing. Q himself had trouble seeing the funny side, given that the rings were family heirlooms. Mycroft had begun wearing his from more or less that time he came of age, because he was- for a given value of the term- taken, and he didn’t want anyone to doubt it. Q had kept his tucked away, frequently forgotten, for many years. Just after he became the Quartermaster, Q began to wear his the same way Mycroft did. In one of their last meetings together outside work, they had drinks at Mycroft’s club. Mycroft said nothing about the ring, but something about the way his eyes fixed to it hurt, and Q started wearing it on a chain around his neck instead. He never knew if it served as a reminder of what he would never have, or as a promise that there was still hope. Or, he sometimes thought, perhaps it was somehow both.          *   *   *Q was mildly- and perhaps not altogether happily- surprised when he woke up. He was sore, but fuzzily so- drugged, he supposed. He was in MI6 medical branch, or perhaps somewhere even more secret, and apparently not dead.There was a hand wrapped around his, tight enough for him to feel that, if nothing else.His eyes slid up the arm attached to the hand and felt something fierce and hot and bright in his chest. He wondered once again if the universe had possibly made a mistake, with him and the name written over his heart, because he could imagine no circumstances in which he would be happier to see 007 than he was to see his brother just then.  Mycroft was in his shirtsleeves. He looked bone tired, but even so Q had difficulty imagining circumstances wherein he would have felt secure enough to fall asleep like that, head pillowed on the bed next to their joined hands. But then Q looked around some more and saw Sherlock in his dark coat, lurking in the doorway like an oversized crow. He saw a small blond man in a lumpy jumper outside the door and recognized John Watson. He knew that things had evened out between Mycroft and Sherlock since Sherlock met John. Though he still sometimes ached to think about it, Q understood that Mycroft was happier too, knowing someone else was looking out for Sherlock as well. That Mycroft had never expected or even wanted Sherlock to act like a soulmate to him. That loving from a distance and receiving nothing in return was what Mycroft ultimately did best, even when it hurt him. Though Q still thought that John Watson, at least, might have been a little kinder if he knew what was written over Mycroft’s heart, he also knew that Mycroft did not require kindness from the doctor.In order to so much as move one hand, Q had to think about it very hard, and as he was thinking about it Sherlock stepped forward.  “You’re awake,” he said. He pitched his voice low, and Q supposed that Mycroft must have been truly exhausted to get such consideration out of their brother.“Well spotted,” Q replied. His voice was quiet too, though mainly because he couldn’t manage much more. “You should be a detective, you.”Sherlock rolled his eyes.“How much do you know?” Q asked after a moment.“I have been ever-so-graciously informed of the parts which are not classified.” At Q’s raised brow, Sherlock elaborated: “That you were injured.” He looked thoughtful for a moment. “I can discern somewhat more than that, of course.”“Of course.”“I know that you were injured in the line of duty, but that your work does not usually put you in physical danger. I know that you get out very little in your current job and rarely interact with anyone at all apart from your coworkers and Mycroft, all of whom were both surprised and distressed by… what happened. Your injuries were severe but not ultimately life-threatening, and yet you believed you were going to die, so I suspect that no rescue was planned because there was never meant to be any danger. I take this to mean that you were meeting with someone we considered a potential ally, or at least not an outright enemy- most likely someone with a technological expertise, as you were the one sent to explain what Britain had to offer. You were shot, however, and you expected to die. Believing this, you said something- over a secure communication line, not a cell-phone, so it was to a coworker- that you now regret saying. I assume it regarded… feelings.” Sherlock cocked his head to one side. “Sentiment suits you as poorly as it does Mycroft.”Q gritted his teeth and did not reply to that one.Sherlock’s assessing gaze grew heavy, and there was something frighteningly tender in his voice when he said, “I had not thought you had found your soul mate, Sherrinford.”“No? Well, I didn’t want you to. He couldn’t have lived in Alaska, could he? It would’ve been too bloody easy.”Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it again, frowning. He looked… sad, and it was so bizarre that Q wondered if he was really awake at all. “It’s not…” Sherlock turned uncharacteristically hesitant. “It’s not something to avoid.” His eyes flickered to the doorway where he could see his army doctor. “Lord knows, I feared it once, but-”“I’m not talking to you about this,” Q said. “This is a dream or something.”“Shall I pinch you?”“Please don’t.”Mycroft was obviously very tired indeed to still be asleep- either that or he was awake and pretending not to be to let Q talk to Sherlock in peace. Either way, Q finally managed to reach out to him, fingers brushing soft hair.Mycroft moved, blinking sleepily.“Tell Sherrinford that he isn’t dreaming,” Sherlock said.Though he blinked a few more times, Mycroft didn’t look too confused, so most likely he’d been at least partially awake. “I regret not,” he said. He squeezed Q’s hand.   “How do you feel?”“Not bad,” he replied, squeezing back. “I guess they gave me the good drugs.” He tugged on Mycroft’s hand. “C’mere.” Though the beds were big in whatever special medical facility Mycroft had put him in, it still took some doing for Mycroft to lie down next to him, and even more for to Q to touch as much of him as possible without jostling anything important. He couldn’t comfortably rest his head on Mycroft’s chest as he preferred to, but it was good enough to be side by side for the time being. As he got situated, Q happened to glance at Sherlock. In the split second it took for Sherlock realize he’d been seen, Q beheld what could only be interpreted as jealousy in his eyes. There was longing there, too- a look sufficiently like the one Mycroft had cast in Sherlock’s direction countless times to be downright eerie- and for a moment Q was angry to see it, as if all the love and affection Sherlock could possibly have wanted hadn’t been there for the taking this whole time.But then Q thought about Sherlock- for whom human emotions were the only unsolvable mystery- and realized it wasn’t that simple.Q recognized the hurt in Sherlock's eyes from so many half-forgotten instances, and he realized that Sherlock wasn’t, in fact, the only one to blame for the awkwardness between them. It would never have been easy for Mycroft to break through Sherlock’s defenses and make him understand that he loved him unconditionally- but it was possible that he could have tried harder than he did. Sherlock loved both his siblings, such as he could; Q knew that- but somewhere along the line he and Mycroft seemed to have decided it wasn’t enough. Maybe, by not trying harder, they- but Mycroft especially- had somehow silently told Sherlock that what he had to give wasn’t worth fighting for.  It took two to make an estrangement, after all, and Sherlock had only ever managed to pull so far away because Mycroft had let him, as he would never have done if Q had withdrawn like that.Maybe, in his way, what Sherlock had meant all those years ago when he’d said, ‘You want it gone,’ was, ‘You would like me better if it was gone.’And, just maybe, it was a little bit true.  If things were easier between them now that John Watson had come into the picture, it might well be because Sherlock had begun to understand love a little better- and perhaps he now knew that if Mycroft resented him it didn’t mean that he didn’t love him too. And yet, even understanding that and wanting to move forward, he had been shrugging Mycroft off his whole life and now didn’t think himself able to ask for the contact Q found as easy as breathing.In that moment, Q felt sorry for Sherlock. The emotion was quite alarming.Once Mycroft’s arm was around him, though, Q honestly forgot about Sherlock altogether, and though he knew that Mycroft never forgot about Sherlock altogether, he certainly approximated it well. Softly, Mycroft said, “You ought to have told me about Bond.”“I suppose I… I thought you knew,” Q returned.“You flatter me,” Mycroft returned with a slightly bitter laugh. “I’m sure I must have known the name once, but I forgot it. Or, at the very least, when his name began to cross my desk I never quite… processed it in that light. What we did when we deleted your identity… effectively giving up on your ever finding him… to think that you would wind up working for the same people.”“It’s horrible, isn’t it?”“I was going to say rather miraculous.” When Q stared at him, Mycroft sighed. “What we did was not meant to be a punishment, just a means to an end.”“I know that.”“And yet you think it was to be at the expense of your happiness?”“Don’t know if my happiness has anything to do with it,” Q said, frowning. “For one thing, the man is a menace.”Mycroft laughed quietly. “That much I’ll grant you.”“Thank you,” Q replied, dubiously. “For another, we can’t exactly carry on as we were, can we?   I can never be his handler again, and besides… there are no bonded Double-O’s for a reason. He loves his work and I love mine. I liked how we were. I would never have said anything if I didn’t legitimately think I was about to die.”“And why did you say something then?” Mycroft asked, in that gentle prompting tone he always used with Sherlock when he thought their brother was on the cusp of deducing something extremely important.“Because he would feel my death and I wanted to warn him. He deserved to…” Q trailed off. That wasn’t all there was to it and Q had never been able to lie to Mycroft, even by omission. “Also, there was a moment that it all seemed so dreadfully unfair. But I think that was blood loss talking.” Q remembered Sherlock and glanced sidelong at him, half expecting his brother to have slipped out when he realized emotions were being discussed. But there Sherlock still was.“Ah, you little fool,” Mycroft said, fondly. Q felt Mycroft’s smile against his temple.Sherlock must not have noticed Q watching him that time, because he reacted to the words as if he’d been slapped. Q understood what a source of contention intelligence had always been between them- how bitterly Sherlock had always resented the fact that Q could easily get praise from Mycroft- and from everyone- for his work in mathematics and engineering, while Sherlock’s own intelligence- manifesting as it did in a manner far more similar to their older brother’s- was so consistently criticized. But Q had always known something else Sherlock didn’t- being called a fool wasn’t always meant to be an insult. But Sherlock wasn’t really reacting to the words this time as much to the fondness he heard in Mycroft’s voice. And again, after so long missing it entirely, Q managed to identify jealousy in Sherlock’s face, and again he found himself feeling sorry for his brother.Q tried to put it from his mind, and said to Mycroft, “I take it you see a solution?”“It will be complicated, I grant you,” Mycroft said. “And you will, unfortunately, not be able to have everything. But I am damned if I will let you not have this.”“Oh,” Q managed, surprised by the ferocity in Mycroft’s voice. Beyond it, Q heard regret- and wondered if Mycroft was not, in fact, keenly aware that he had failed with Sherlock, and was- as he so often did- channeling what he’d never managed to have himself into Q. “Well. All right then. If he even wants-”“He will,” Mycroft said, confidently.      *   *   *Q’s “Reasons not to date James Bond” list, were he to have committed it to paper, might have looked something like this:1. Dating is a waste of valuable time, no matter who it’s with. Have you seen my schedule lately?2. We’re colleagues. It would make things messy when we broke up, which we would.A3. Bond doesn’t really care about me. He just wants to add another notch to his bedpost. Once that’s done… see #2. A3. Even if it did work out, what kind of relationship can a Double-O really maintain? See #2.4. I myself am shit at relationships. See #2.5. #2 is really very important.It all came back to the job, the thing Q gave up everything for. Well- technically Q gave up everything to get out prison, but Mycroft would have known that getting him out of prison was only worth the ink on the order if it put Q in a job he would find worth the sacrifice. A job he would love. And he did love it.He loved it a lot more than he’d ever intended to love James Bond, anyway- but somewhere along the line it seemed that too had gone wrong.  *   *   *“So. Sherrinford.”Q groaned theatrically. “I never liked that name.”“I admit I sometimes had difficulty imagining using it,” Bond said, so casually it was as though he hadn’t broached a deeply complicated subject.Determinedly, Q skirted the issue. “Anyway, only Sherlock uses it now.”“Sherlock. Your brother.”“Was there a question in there, 007?”“James, please.”Q had to work hard to get his mouth around it. “James.” The agent had arrived at his beside some time ago with a deck of cards. Q was happy enough for the distraction, but Bond was so clearly distracted himself that the conversation consistently foundered. Q had never known the man to flounder like this.“He’s- Sherlock, he’s-” Bond seemed to be searching for an inoffensive adjective. Eventually he said, “The two of you resemble each other.”“I’ve been given to understand that Sherlock is the more handsome.”“Have you?”“Well. I never agreed. I suppose if one has no objection to having one’s face sliced to pieces by those cheekbones there might be some appeal.”“I would object,” Bond laughed. “Strenuously.”Q eyed him. There was a warmth in Bond’s eyes and in his voice that made Q actually want to call him James. This was the closest Q expected he’d get to hearing, ‘I only have eyes for you’ and it was a deal closer than he’d ever hoped. “James,” he said, and immediately could think of nothing else.The warmth in those eyes deepened. “Why didn’t you tell me?”As much as he wanted to, Q couldn’t bring himself to say that it was because it wasn’t exactly easy to insist to James Bond that they were soulmates. He was looking not at 007 or even Bond- he was looking at James, and Q found himself physically incapable of blaming the man for anything that had happened. “I gave up my name,” he said. “And when I did, I gave up everything that name meant, and that included this. How could I just-”“Your other brother assures me that it was never meant to be like that- and suggesting he got something wrong seems to be some form of treason.”Q chuckled, thinking of how many times over Sherlock would have been jailed in that case, and James laughed along with him. “But do you want this?” Q pressed when they quieted. “I remember what you said about soulmates.”“Do you know, even as I said it I had a feeling that would come back to haunt me? It’s… not as simple as I made it sound.”“But it is true.”“Yes. It’s true.”Q smiled.James looked faintly surprised. “Most people would find that offensive.”“Most people aren’t me.” Q sighed. “If you hadn’t been… you, I might have gone for that drink with you. I might not. I would never have wanted to be just another notch on your bedpost. But I also hated the thought that if I was more than that, it was only because of my name. This whole business… I don’t know how much I’m allowed to tell you about myself, but those marks very nearly tore my family apart. They make your future, you know. It doesn’t always seem fair, not to be able to choose these things.”“I can tell you truly,” Bond said, taking his hand, “that I’m no more interested in getting to know you better now than I was before. But since someone up there does think that we’re meant to be- I can’t wait to see why.”“Everything’s going to change.”“I’m not afraid if you aren’t.”Though it was the last thing he’d ever anticipated, Q meant it when he said, “I’m not.”     ",Heartlines,11178

Sherlock Holmes, a third year scorpion and the school’s brightest pupil, sat atop some pebbles and strained to pay attention while his first-period teacher demonstrated stinging on a crinkly, serrated leaf. He normally had no trouble staying attuned to his lessons, given he didn’t already know the material, but lately he’d been overcome by confusing instinctual urges. At any moment at least three to six of his eyes were drawn to the sturdy, rippling exoskeleton of Scorpion High’s star Stick And Rock player, John. John was a fourth-year and several months Sherlock’s senior. Rumor had it he’d fertilized half a dozen females, and twice that number had tried to eat him. He displayed advantageous physical characteristics that suggested he would produce healthy offspring, Sherlock couldn’t help but note. Watching John rest his lustrous carapace against that stone was enough to heat his internal temperature an entire degree.Of course, John didn’t know Sherlock even existed.After many failed attempts, their teacher gave up on stinging the leaf and set it aside.“Jab your tail thing in the other thing--the thing you want to sting,” said the teacher. “That usually works.”Sherlock nodded. That sounded right to him.“And don’t forget,” the teacher continued. “Scorpion Prom is next week. Some of you look like you haven’t found dates yet. You should if you don’t want to be losers. Alright, any questions about stinging or being the only loser at Prom? No? Then class dismissed!”Inwardly Sherlock cringed. He couldn’t do so outwardly as that would have betrayed weakness, inviting unwanted attention from the larger scorpions at school. He did not have a date to prom, and he was worried he might be a loser. He didn’t want to be a loser; losers got eaten.Chirring excitedly, the young scorplings filed out of class.“Hi, Sherlock,” said a small voice. Sherlock observed a plain female scorpion sidle up beside him. What was her name? Mary? Mallory?She tapped her metasoma nervously. “What class do you have next?”“Food,” he replied.“Cool. I have Pinching.” Molly. That was her name. He’d taken a Burrowing class with her last semester.Aware she was still following him, he continued crawling in the direction of Food. Her Pinching class was another wing over. Perhaps she was lost.“Um, Sherlock?”Maybe she needed directions. “Yes?”“Do you have a date for Scorpion Prom?”He answered honestly. “I don't.”He felt her stare and was compelled to return it. The enormity of her eyes overpowered her petite frame. There was an expressiveness to them that Sherlock found disorienting. He wondered if John ever felt that way. He wondered about John maybe more than he should. But then everything he was supposed to wonder about seemed so boring in comparison.“Would you, um, like to go to Prom with me?” Molly asked suddenly.She was still there? Oh. Sherlock took a moment to consider her proposal. Molly was puny and delicate, and her mesosoma was way too long for her carapace. On the other hand, if he had a date to Prom he wouldn’t be a loser. He also didn’t want to be eaten.“Okay,” he said with a shrug of his pedipalps.“Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,” said Molly, her prosoma darkening. She clasped a claw to her chelicerae. He hoped she wasn’t sick. “That’s so amazing. Um, I mean . . . you can pick me up at my burrow at eight. Oh, and Sherlock? I hear that it’s going to be a moonless night.”Sherlock clicked his pincers as Molly scuttled away. She was correct. It was going to be a moonless night. He’d received high marks in both his “Time” and “Is It Light Or Dark Out?” honors courses.It was only after she had left that he realized she was referring to the fact that scorpions generally only mated on moonless nights, when they were less visible to predators. How strange, he thought. She certainly didn’t smell as though she’d reached sexual maturity yet.That’s when he felt someone shove him forward, hard.“Hey, you, uh—you nerd!” cried Greg, a bulky, unpleasant scorpion who had a habit of harassing and eating smaller scorplings he found unworthy. His two equally hulking friends lurked behind him, opening and closing their spiracles menacingly. Sherlock’s pectines twitched. He had a bad feeling about this.“Greg,” he acknowledged. “What do you want?” He was going to be late for class.Greg waved his telson in the air.“What I want is my homework,” he threatened.Sherlock froze. From across the hollow log where they stood he could see John watching him. Given that scorpions had poor eyesight it very well could have been someone else, and yet he knew it wasn’t. His thorax tightened and for a moment he thought he might throw up. The idea that Greg might sting him as John looked on . . .“Oh,” he managed, despite the rising fear in his intestines. “The answer to yesterday’s assignment is ‘Eat, then poop.’”Greg lowered his telson. “You’re alright, Sherlock.” He beckoned to his friends. “Come on. Let’s go behind that rock and sting each other.”Sherlock blinked, and his stomach cavity settled. He searched for John again, but just like a delicious termite disappearing into its mound, he was gone.Dazed, Sherlock arrived at his next class just in time for roll call.“Sherlock Holmes?”“Here!” he chittered, settling into the rotted wood.“Very good. Sherrinford Holmes?”Silence. Sherlock raised a pedipalp.“He’s out today.”“Does he have an excuse?” the teacher asked.Sherlock looked down. “Mum ate him last night.” It was just him and Mycroft, now.The teacher noted it and continued calling roll until everyone who hadn’t been eaten was accounted for.Sherlock didn’t bother feigning interest in the lecture, his thoughts drifting between pre-Prom anxieties and visions of John: those piercing median and lateral eyes set into that smooth carapace, trailing toward his obscenely exaggerated telson. With such favorable genetics it was no surprise he’d made the Stick And Rock team his first year. Sherlock attended every game that semester just to watch him play, though he doubted John noticed him amidst the crowd. He wasn’t even sure he understood the rules of Stick And Rock, but everyone agreed that John was very good at it.To introduce himself would have required squeezing past the harem of females who swarmed John after each game. Several bragged of having been fertilized by their idol, but Sherlock suspected many were lying, based on their size. A gut instinct in his first abdominal segment told him John wouldn’t be the type to settle for a female physically smaller than himself.“Sherlock?” The teacher was calling his name.He would think about John some more later. “Yes, sorry?”“Pull your prosoma out of that burrow and pay attention,” tsked the teacher. “I expect better from you. Now: you have three crickets. If you eat one, how many do you have left?”Sucking air through his spiracles at exactly the standard rate of diffusion from the atmosphere, the wheels in Sherlock’s brain began to turn. It took some effort to get the answer.“One,” he said.The teacher paused.“Sure,” she finally replied. “I can’t count.” Then: “Do you eat the remaining cricket?”Could this be a trick question? Sherlock was sure he knew this one, too. “Yes.”The teacher clicked her pincers approvingly. “Good. Always eat the cricket. Moving on: who of you hasn't found a date to Prom?”-xxx-The sun rose and fell several cycles until Scorpion Prom night had arrived. Rumor had it John was taking three females at the same time. Someone told him this was against the rules, but after looking up the school guidelines the principal determined he couldn’t read.Worryingly, Sherlock didn’t see Molly all day.He stopped by her burrow at the appointed time with a frothy, liquefied cricket torso, his carapace freshly picked clean of clinging moss and vermiculite. A bulky, scowling scorpion Sherlock took to be Molly’s father waited at the tunnel entrance.“Hello,” Sherlock said, trying not to sound nervous. “I’m here to pick up Molly for Scorpion Prom.”Molly’s father took a good look at him.“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m afraid Molly won’t be coming tonight.”Sherlock assumed the worst. “Did she get eaten?”The older scorpion shook his prosoma. “No. She’s just molting. She said she doesn’t want you to see her like this.”Dejected, Sherlock went to Scorpion Prom alone.He watched the other scorpions dance as he sat in the corner sucking cricket juice from the torso he’d intended to give to Molly. Meanwhile, John was probably having the time of his life, being that he was an attractive scorpion and not a dateless loser.Powerful vibrations buzzed up Sherlock’s pectines, and within moments some oafish scorpion crawled over his foremost leg to reach one of the dew-covered leaves set out for students.“Sorry,” the scorpion said. It was hard to hear him over the musical chirring emanating from the stagerock. “I didn’t mean to step on you. Are you okay?”“It’s fine,” said Sherlock, scuttling out of the way.A strong but graceful pedipalp grabbed one of the leaves. At second smell Sherlock realized the pedipalp belonged to none other than John. He stared at the other scorpion like a dummy, the remainder of the liquified cricket contents oozing onto his claw.After taking a sip, John set down the leaf. “Sherlock, right?”Sherlock’s pectines tensed with such force it felt like he’d been stung in the basal piece.“Yes!” he yelped, almost in pain. “That’s me.”“I thought I recognized you. You’ve been to all my Stick And Rock games.”John had noticed him? “Oh, um, yes,” Sherlock mumbled, blood rushing to his prosoma. “I admire your playing.”John nodded. “Can I ask you a question?” He’d lowered his voice.“Yeah, anything,” Sherlock said. He hoped John wasn’t in some kind of trouble.“Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but what are the actual rules of Stick And Rock?” John scratched his dorsal plates with his telson, shifting legs.Sherlock’s caudal segment clenched involuntarily. Did John not actually know, or was he just messing with him?Regardless, he didn’t want to seem stupid, so he made his best guess. “You have to touch the stick to the rock.”John’s posture straightened.“Of course,” he murmured. “That makes so much sense. Thank you.”“Sure,” Sherlock said, feeling kind of cool. “Glad to help.”John offered him a sip from his leaf but Sherlock declined.For a moment neither said nor smelt anything. And then John brought up the worst possible thing he could have.“So, did you come to Prom without a date?”Sherlock wished a bird would swoop down and snatch him away right then.“She couldn’t, you see, she was, well, the thing is—no. I didn’t.” Horrified, he imagined a ravished John tearing him limb from limb with his claws, his loser status now revealed.But John didn’t eat him.“Hey,” he said, patting Sherlock’s carapace. “It’s okay. I don’t care much for females, anyway.”Their telsons brushed. The scorpions locked six and seven eyes together, respectively.“But John,” chittered Sherlock. “You brought the school's three biggest females as your dates.”“Yeah, because that's what I'm biologically expected to do. But they’re not really who I’m interested in.” John lowered his tail enough that his caudal segment massaged Sherlock’s prosoma. The heady pheromones it released would have made Sherlock shiver had his rigid exoskeleton allowed such a thing.Several minutes later, Molly burst into the burrow where the dance was being held, newly minted from her molt. Every eye turned to her, taking in her proud, elegant tail and perfect mesasoma-to-metasoma ratio. Several males would be eaten later that night after their mates caught them stealing glances at her well-formed pedipalps.Sadly for Molly, Sherlock had found a new date, and the pair were nowhere to be seen.Uncountable meters away (by scorpions standards), in a dry, snug burrow dug under a moonless sky, a careful listener would have overheard one of many scorpion couplings that evening.“Can I fertilize you?”“No, John. We’re both males.”“. . . Can I try?”“Yes.”","Drama at Scorpion High (Sherlock/John, Scorpion Universe)",2052

He never finds out what exactly she tells the administration, but he is excused each day and sent to the orchestra room to work on his violin fingering.He gets as far as deducing it is something about what his voice can do before Mycroft pulls him aside and tells him everything.That summer, Sherlock is sent far from home to learn about his true heritage and is taught exactly how to use his gift to best effect. He learns about weaving intention and desire into each note, about how to make one song’s direction last for hours. The more Sherlock works at it, the better and more precise results he gets. By the end of the summer, he is able to convince the ferry captain that allowing a twelve year-old to navigate his vessel most of the way back to the mainland is a superb idea.A few months after he returns home, Mycroft tells him off for making the hired help collect mushroom samples instead of doing their assigned duties, and tries to instil the idea that free will is important and should be respected.“Your voice can ease your way, but your brain should always be your workhorse. Do not abuse this power, Sherlock,” he advises.Sherlock, testy and brash, shoots back, “Perhaps you should keep that in mind when negotiating for your summer internship in London. It would be a shame if your first government job was won by your nasally voice and not your deformed brain.”---He first uses his gift for something besides compelling servants and stopping school bullies when he arrives at uni. There he meets Victor Trevor and for the first time in his life, his libido fully engages. But Victor makes it clear that he only considers Sherlock to be a friend, a good friend, but only a friend.So, Sherlock sings to Victor and they end up naked in Sherlock’s narrow dormitory bed moments later. But Sherlock is too excited, too eager, and he does not properly organise his song. Just as he has finally finished preparing Victor and started to press his cock inside, Victor becomes aware again. There is a great deal of shouting before Victor storms out, convinced that Sherlock gave him some sort of inhibition-lowering drug.He never sees Victor again.After that complete disaster, Sherlock only uses his voice to obtain drugs and to facilitate quick sexual exchanges with strangers in clubs and back alleys. He swears off all attachment, all friendship. Though he will never admit it aloud, Sherlock recognizes that Mycroft was right – his brain should be his mainstay.---Of course, John Watson has him falling back on his old habits almost immediately.Sherlock infuses just a smidgen of song into the invitation to be his flatmate, tries a little less when he asks John to accompany him to the first crime scene of many. And he when he asks about dinner at the conclusion of the case (after John had shot a man for him, without even being told), there is no music at all in his voice.John follows him so quickly, so easily, that Sherlock almost begins to believe that John actually wants to be around him. That maybe he has finally found someone who will not need to be coerced into remaining in his company.But then Sherlock’s pesky libido returns. And John is so purposefully, vocally uninterested, that Sherlock knows he will never have John willingly.Some people are resistant to Siren song and Sherlock especially loves manipulating them with his mind and unsung words. But not John. No, he belongs to the group of humans that are super-receptive, so much so that they sink into a blissful ignorance and forget anything that happens to them under the fugue state.And of course he would be. John was practically made for him. Fortunately for John (and for Sherlock, too), Sherlock is only part Siren, so he has little interest in consuming him. No, his modus operandi is to fuck John, to appreciate the gorgeous thing John becomes when he is all slack-jawed and desperate beneath him, Sherlock’s cock surging into him, John crying out. He is made for this – to be taken and used and enjoyed.Sherlock very nearly wants to ruin John in the worst way possible. But not break. Never break. John is as vital to him as his microscope, his Belstaff, and is treated as such.Sometimes when Sherlock sings to John, John collapses to his knees, face upturned and mouth open, waiting to be filled. All Sherlock has to do next is stand up and John is crawling over to him, whatever he was doing before Sherlock sang completely forgotten. Sherlock once kept John from leaving 221B for two weeks, singing whenever John tried to leave for work or an appointment or lunch or any of the other stupidly mundane things he considered vital.He has only ever met one other person who sunk so low into the melody of his voice as to forget everything that happens under the song’s effect, and that was Victor.But John is worlds different from Victor because John fights him. He fights like the good soldier he once was, always initially refusing to be seduced by the tenor of Sherlock’s song. It is Sherlock’s favourite part about preparing songs for John - the waiting battle. Some days it takes only moments before John is kneeling before him, ready to do whatever Sherlock says. But others, like today, it takes Sherlock several series of verses before John yields.Today, John is in the shower when Sherlock barges in, song already begun.“Oi! You can’t just keep doing that!” John shouts before Sherlock’s song has finished echoing against the tile and into his ears.As Sherlock progresses through the song, he is forced to sing louder and more forcefully as the fight in John’s eyes refuses to disappear. And as much as Sherlock loves the rush of orgasm, he really does love dominating John just that much more, watching as John succumbs and submits.It takes three chorus refrains before John’s clenched teeth and furrowed brow release. Sherlock repeats his coda over and over again, observing as John’s muscles slowly release and compliance steals across his face.He adds an ab lib section to his final coda and watches, expectant and pleased with his own cleverness, as John’s cock gradually fills and rises up.“My greedy, deprived John. Come with me now.” Sherlock opens the door to his bedroom and ushers John forward, stripping the towel John hastily grabbed upon Sherlock’s initial intrusion from his numb fingers. “Lie back on the bed.”John obediently waits as Sherlock climbs atop him, then swings around 180 degrees. He drops his arse to John’s face and commands, “Lick” before grabbing John’s hips and pulling them toward his chest so forcefully and fully that John’s arse is exposed below him.Sherlock skips over the cock begging for his immediate attention and instead starts to mouth at John’s waiting hole. He feels John do the same to him, synchronized rimming, to the point where they simultaneously press their tongues inward sloppily.But Sherlock is the only one who will be doing the penetrating tonight, so he releases John’s legs, instead dictating, “Prepare yourself.”Watching John stuff his lube-covered fingers into himself is one of Sherlock’s favourite sights. In past, he has experimented with telling John to stay silent the entire time, so that he can only open his mouth and squeeze his eyes shut as three thick fingers penetrate his body. But tonight he wants to hear John, hear his gasps and moans.And John does not disappoint, letting out little wimpers as his fingers rub against his insides, crying out as he sinks himself down onto Sherlock’s cock. There is no need for further direction or additional commands as John’s body instinctively takes over, riding Sherlock like it was his idea all along.Sherlock rolls his head back and luxuriates in the feeling of John, the warm velvet of his body around him. This belongs to him. This is his. John is his.---Now, some lost time and another shower later, Sherlock and John are sitting in their respective chairs. John is reading the newspaper and drinking tea while Sherlock pokes at his laptop as a pretence for observing John shifting in his armchair, confused by his uncomfortable seat.He wonders what John thinks has caused his discomfort this time.If John does ever catch onto his missing time or memories, Sherlock has the oft-used and already accepted excuses of ‘for an experiment’ and ‘it was vital to the case’ at the ready.And John will accept them, probably grudgingly, but still accepting, because that is another thing that makes John perfect. He cares for Sherlock, though perhaps not in the way Sherlock most wants.So Sherlock will ensure that John remains his because John should always be his. No matter how many disapproving looks Mycroft gives him, how many times he has to explain away John’s absences and time lapses to their acquaintances, Sherlock will keep doing it until the day he finally gets bored of John or John stops fighting him.Then, and only then, will he finally give in to his instincts and eat John. After all, he has to ensure no one else can ever have what is his. ",Sirenum Scopuli,1598

The domineering and intense, but non-incestuous love that a mother has for an intelligent son, and an often absent or weak father figure.2. The incestuous sexual desire of a mother towards her son.A* * *AMycroft Holmes does not cry.For if he cries, his mother will come to his bedroom late at night and comfort him.AA* * * AMycroft Holmes is an enigma. A man who many people know, and yet know nothing about him. There is only one person who knows the man behind the carefully constructed layers upon layers of self-preservation – Mycroft himself. A certain grey-haired Detective Inspector of New Scotland Yard comes close, but even he doesn’t know everything. Greg knows there are things he can’t know about Mycroft, for their safety. It should bother him more than it does, but for some reason it doesn’t. He is just happy to have at least a part of Mycroft for himself. They have come a long way since they started casually sleeping with each other. What used to be a mutual stress relief is now a full-fledged relationship, with all its ups and downs.Sometimes Mycroft is caught in a middle of nightmare, tossing and turning restlessly in their bed. Afterwards Mycroft is skittish, flinching when Greg tries to comfort him, bordering on catatonic. Greg wished Mycroft could tell him what is wrong.AA* * *AOnce upon a time there was a small boy called Mycroft. He was smarter than most children of his age, a quality that made his mother praise him. It was only natural when your mother is a genius herself.His mother loved him very, very much. So much that she rather slept in her son’s room instead of the bedroom she shared with her husband. It made Mycroft feel important and cherished – his mother loved him the most.AAt first it was just his mother sleeping in the same bed with him, keeping monsters away. Sometimes his mother would pet his hair, telling him what a good boy he was and kissing him goodnight. Nothing more, nothing less.AHer hands were the wandering kind. Stroking his tummy after too much candy, caressing his thighs, fondling his most private parts. At first Mycroft was confused, but then Mummy told him it was alright because he was such a bright and good little boy. Only good little boys were taken care of like that by their Mummies. Mummy would always love him the most.AA* * *AEvery time they visit the notorious Mummy (and the husband), Mycroft is even more polite than usual. Greg just can’t understand what is going with the Holmes brothers and their mother, as she is the most pleasant person he has met for a while. It’s a wonder such a kind woman like her has produced such obnoxious sons. Maybe they had a falling out when Mycroft came out of the closet. They wouldn’t be the first family to have a crisis over someone’s sexual orientation.Later on, when Mycroft is off who knows where with Sherlock, Greg emboldens himself and asks Mummy what her thoughts were when she found out her oldest son is gay. She smiles gently, telling Greg that she was and is perfectly fine with the fact that she is the only woman her son has and will ever love.AA* * *AMycroft couldn’t understand why the great love his Mummy had for him had to be kept a secret. But then Mummy told him they didn’t want to hurt Daddy’s feelings and Mycroft understood it because he was so bright.Somewhere deep inside Mycroft knows that what Mummy is doing to him at nights is not right. But he is too embarrassed to let anyone know about the truth, for he should have known from the start. He’s a genius, after all.AA* * * AMycroft and Sherlock are having a row, again. Although calling it a row is overstating – all they ever do is that Mycroft tries to tell Sherlock what to do and Sherlock refuses to listen. Greg must admit though that having John around has changed things for the better. Not much, but so that brothers actually agree on some things once and a while.Greg wonders if Mycroft and Sherlock even know what it’s like to have a loving and supporting brother, instead of one that belittles you every step of the way.AA* * *AWhen Mycroft is ten years old, Mummy gets pregnant after many years of miscarriages and heartbreak. When his younger brother is born, Mycroft thinks he’s the most beautiful thing he has ever seen.They name him William Sherlock Scott Holmes. Mycroft wonders if his little brother is going to be as bright as him. For if he is, then Mycroft must protect him. It’s his duty as an older brother. ’Please let him be smarter than me, please don’t let him believe the lies Mummy is telling me at nights’ Mycroft prays silently. It’s not the future he wants his baby brother to have.AA* * *ASherlock claims that Mycroft is only interested in his career and influence among the people. To Mycroft, people are only pawns in a never-ending game of fame and fortune, of knowledge and power. Sherlock despises his older brother and his ways.Sherlock might be blind when it comes to his brother, but Greg can see how much Sherlock’s words are actually hurting Mycroft. He wonders, yet again, why Mycroft can’t show Sherlock how much he really cares. Later on, when Sherlock has stormed off, Greg tries to discuss the matter with Mycroft to no avail. It’s a mystery to be solved, and Greg is determined to make things work between the brothers because he’s tired of seeing the hurt in Mycroft’s eyes every time Sherlock insults him.AA* * *AYears go by, and Mummy’s visits to Mycroft’s bedroom at nights continue. Mycroft makes sure that he mocks his little brother and his intelligence every time has the chance – if her mother thinks that Mycroft is the more intelligent one, she will leave Sherlock alone. Mycroft goes even that far to suggest that Sherlock would probably be better off at boarding school, away from Mummy’s disapproving eyes. Sherlock away would also mean more time together for Mummy and Mycroft, without the fear of being interrupted by a child demanding his mother’s attention.Mycroft congratulates himself when he has successfully alienated Mummy from Sherlock. The things he would do out of love for his little brother have no limits. At least Sherlock will be safe, and hopefully will find love someday. Mycroft suffers silently inside his head, when Mummy lowers herself to his erect cock, riding herself into an orgasm. He feels nothing.AA* * *AGreg loves making love with Mycroft. The sounds he makes when he gives himself fully to the act, dropping all the pretenses and masks, the passion many would be surprised to see he possesses. It’s all there, and Greg never grows tired of it.Counting Mycroft’s freckles when they’re lying side by side is his favourite thing to do.AA* * *AThe only times Mycroft feels anything is when he’s eating. Food becomes his savior, his only pleasure, the one thing that will lift his spirits when he’s feeling down. So Mycroft eats and eats and eats, until he realizes how much he has eaten in one go. It’s so disgusting. The only way to feel better is to get rid of the food he just ate. Throwing up fixes everything.Mycroft hates his body and how it betrays him.AA* * *ALater on Greg wishes he could take it all back. How he was stupid and pushed on, when Mycroft clearly told him to let things be. He has caused his lover so much pain and anguish, over things neither of them have any control of.One night, after a particularly vivid nightmare, it all comes out. Mycroft is agitated, torn between keeping his worst memories to himself and telling everything to Greg because of the trust between them. Greg embraces him, telling him it was only a nightmare, and that’s when Mycroft snaps.A“It was not just a nightmare. It was my childhood.”AWords like “incest”, “sexual abuse”, ”eating disorder”  are talked over and over again. How Mycroft sacrificed himself in order to protect Sherlock. How Mycroft turned their mother against her own, long-awaited younger son so that he wouldn’t have to go through the same horrors he had to.AHow he can never tell Sherlock how much he means to him, because it would mean telling the truth. And truth is something Sherlock can never know.AThe next time Sherlock insults Mycroft, Greg wishes Sherlock would know how much his older brother truly loves him.",Did Anybody Hear The Things We Didn't Mean,1442

(I regret nothing with that title.) Ahem. Anywhoo ... welcome to my first time delving into Sherlock and Molly smut ... oh dear  ... what have these two done to me? Ahh yes, on to what the story is about! Molly has had an utterly awful day at work and decides to make herself some chocolate chip cookies. Sherlock, being Sherlock, deduces her bad day and decides to make it better ... with his ... body ... I think you get the idea ;) Basically this is purely fluffy smut! ENJOY!!!","A_________________________________________________AAIt was one of those days. One of those days where everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Molly felt as if the universe was against her!AAFirst she had overslept, some how managing to repeatedly hit the snooze button. But it had felt so good to go back to sleep! Damn Sherlock and his experiments! If he hadn’t kept her up so late, helping him, she would have gotten up on time.AASecondly, she had forgotten her umbrella, something she rarely ever left her flat without. And of course today it had to be raining. Not a soft, gentle rain, but a downright deluge! Luckily she always kept an extra pair of clothes and shoes in her locker. Mostly just in case if she happened to have a rather tricky (i.e. messy) autopsy or if something went wrong in the lab.AAThirdly, Sherlock never came by for his visit. Ever since they had entered into a relationship (yes, in spite of his dislike for titles they had to call what they were in, something!) he would always stop by to see her. She hadn’t even had a text from him. Figuring though that he was busy with a case she chose not to bother him. But the lack of seeing him in her lab was the icing on the cake of her miserable day. That and the fact that an intern had just broken an entire set of beakers.AAIt was with a great sigh of relief that she walked out of Bart’s hospital at the end of her shift. She didn’t usually feel this way upon leaving the morgue, it was her home away from home, but today it had been entirely against her. She wanted nothing more than to go to her flat and change into her most comfortable clothes, have a glass of red wine and cuddle with Toby. He was a poor replacement for Sherlock though. Sherlock always did a lot more than cuddle with her.AAOf course it was still raining and of course she still didn’t have an umbrella, thus she arrived at her flat rather drenched. After toweling herself off, and peeling from her skin her soaked clothing, she put on a pair of her softest pyjama bottoms and one of Sherlock’s t-shirts.AAToby mewled happily at her as she walked towards the kitchen. She gave him some food and then poured herself a generous glass of wine. Opening the fridge she eyed its contents, but nothing appealed to her.AA“This type of days calls for a batch of chocolate chip cookies!”AAAfter grabbing her iPad off the coffee table she pulled up the recipe and proceeded to gather the ingredients. The kitchen filled with the sound of her humming, and the scent of melting butter, as she began to chop up some almonds. Her text tone chirped. Grabbing up her mobile she saw that it was from Sherlock.AA‘Sorry I didn’t come to the lab; I had a case, a nine. I was in my mind palace for most of the day. Forgive me? – SH’AAMolly smiled slightly as she read his text.AA‘You’re forgiven. I missed you today. – Mx’AA‘Where are you? – SH’AA‘At my flat. – Mx’AA‘What are you doing? – SH’AAShe shook her head and rolled her eyes.AA‘I’m baking. – Mx’AA‘Rough day? – SH’AANow she found herself smiling fully. He knew that she had the tendency to bake when work had been awful.AA‘Yes. – Mx’AA‘Can I come over and make it better? – SH’AAShe giggled slightly as she typed out her reply.AA‘You need never ask. Please come. – Mx’AA‘I intend to make you do that several times tonight. – SH’AAShe felt her cheeks grow bright red. Putting her phone down, she returned to the task at hand. By the time she heard the sound of her flat door opening and closing the cookies were in the oven and she was doing the washing up.AADrying her hands she rushed out of the kitchen and jumped into Sherlock’s arms. She had gotten in the habit of greeting him in this manner. He had learned to brace himself; the first time had ended up with the pair of them lying on the floor. This ended up not exactly being a bad thing.AAHe held on to her tightly, cupping her bum in his hands as they kissed deeply. She moaned into his mouth as he pressed her up against him, letting her feel exactly how much he wanted her.AA“Time?” He croaked out.AA“Eight minutes.” She panted.AA“Hmmm …”AAHe carried her to the sofa, lying her down on her back. She peered up at him, still breathing heavily.AA“What are you doing?”AAIn reply he gave her a sly grin. Leaning forward he took a hold of the tops of her pyjama bottoms and pulled them down; revealing that she conveniently wore no knickers underneath. She flashed him a cheeky grin in return. He tossed the pyjama bottoms off to the side and kneeled in between her legs.AAWith a hand at each ankle he slowly moved them upwards, over her smooth pale skin. He stopped when his hands reached her knees, and with a gentle nudge he spread her legs wider apart.AALeaning forward once more he kissed her as he moved one of his hands further upwards, his fingertips tracing along her inner thigh. She let out a small gasp into his mouth as his fingers slipped in between her slick folds. He moaned in approval of her arousal.AABreaking apart their kiss he hovered over her as he worked his fingers in her. He then began to move downwards, pressing hot kisses along her jaw line, onto her neck, then her breasts, suckling on them through the fabric of the t-shirt. His fingers were still moving inside of her, but not touching one vital area. Her body was aching for it; she needed him to touch her there.AA“Please …” She begged, loving yet also hating how he could turn her into such a whimpering mess.AAHis mouth was now on her stomach, kissing around the navel. Ever so slowly he moved downwards until …AA“YES!”AAShe had thrown her head back, burying her hands in his curls as he lapped at her with his tongue. She came quickly around his fingers, crying out, her legs shuddering slightly. With one last gentle suck he lifted his head and pulled his fingers out of her. As she lay there, panting heavily, she watched as he licked his fingers clean.AA“Love the taste of you.” He murmured before moving forward to kiss her again.AAMolly kissed him back hungrily, clearly desperate for more. When properly aroused, her desire was not quickly sated. Nor was Sherlock’s. The timer broke through their arousal driven state. He let out a groan of annoyance, falling off to one side as she got up from the sofa and moved towards the kitchen. He watched her, noting that just the very tip of her bum was peeking out from beneath the t-shirt she still wore.AAFollowing her into the kitchen he watched for a few moments as she carefully removed each of the cookies onto a cooling rack. Just as she placed the last cookie he stepped up behind her, slipping his arms about her waist and buried his face in her neck. She let out a soft sigh as she leaned back in to him.AA“I could have you right here, right now, just like this.” His voice was no more than a hoarse whisper. Moving his hand downward he once more slipped his fingers between her folds.AAShe moaned softly, “So why don’t you?”AAHe started to kiss her neck, “Because tonight is all about you, not what I want. And I know you prefer the bed.” With this said he lifted her up in his arms and carried her bridal style towards the bedroom. She had let out a yelp as he picked her up and quickly began to laugh. She grabbed the back of his head, pulling him down towards her so that she could kiss him. Once in the bedroom he laid her down upon the bed and was about to lean forward to kiss her again when a loud persistent meow broke through their moment.AA“Absolutely not!”AASherlock spun about searching for the source of the unwanted interruption. Spotting Toby he quickly removed him from the room and shut the door.AA“Damn beast!”AAMolly had pushed herself up on her elbows and was smiling at him. He smiled back at her and got onto the bed, hovering his body over hers.AA“Where were we?”AATheir lips met in a passionate kiss. Slipping his hands under the t-shirt he gave it a gentle tug. She sat up a bit further, and they broke apart the kiss so that the t-shirt could be removed in entirety.AA“Lie back.” He murmured against her lips.AAShe did as he requested, and he kissed her once more. His hands had come to rest on her hips and were now moving upwards. They did not stop until they reached her breasts. He cupped them in his hands and she let out a moan into his mouth as he began to massage and knead them with his fingers. He gently pinched each nipple between a finger and his thumb.AABreaking away from her mouth he began to leave a hot trail of wet kisses from her lips, down her neck, onto her clavicle, until he suckled one pebbled nipple into his mouth. His hand was still massaging the other breast. After duly spending attention upon it, he switched his mouth to her other nipple.AA“Sherlock…” Her voice came out in a breathy tone.AAHe glanced up at her, her eyes were closed, her lips slightly parted. Her cheeks were ever so faintly flushed. She repeated his name again. He knew exactly what she wanted. With his mouth still upon her breast, his teeth grazing across it ever so slightly, he moved his hand downwards over her stomach until reaching the desired spot. She cried out as he moved his thumb in a circular motion. She lifted up her lips, pressing herself into his hand as she rode out yet another orgasm.AAHer hips dropped back down to the mattress as she lay there catching her breath. She opened her eyes and looked at him. He smiled down at her, having released her breast from his mouth. She kissed him hungrily, pouring as much appreciation as she could into that one kiss. It was not every day that The World’s Only Consulting Detective could be so entirely unselfish.AAAs they continued to kiss she moved her hands to his chest and began to unbutton his shirt, but her fingers fumbled. He chuckled as he pulled away from her.AA“Why the hell are you still wearing clothes?” She questioned him.AAHe smiled down at her as he slipped off the bed and proceeded to undress himself. She had returned to her previous position; sitting up on her elbows. She watched him with hungry eyes as his pale skin slowly became revealed. Her eyes trailed downwards, only stopping when they came to the rather large erection he was sporting. A slight shiver traveled through her body. Molly rather loved the fact that Sherlock always wanted her as much as she wanted him.AANow fully naked he moved himself back on to the bed and slipped his body over hers, at last skin to skin. She hummed happily as she kissed him again, her nipples pressing into his chest. She moved a hand down between their bodies and gave him a few gentle strokes. His body jerked slightly.AA“Mmmff! Molly. Don’t.” He panted out, “Tonight is about you, not me.”AAShe gave him another stroke with her finger and he swatted her hand away, causing her to giggle. His nose was pressed against hers; she could feel his hot breath hitting her cheek.AA“Mmm … I want you. I need you.” She murmured to him.AATheir eyes were locked on each others.AA“Want you. Too.” He seemed to almost struggle to get these words out.AAShe loved it when he looked like this, so positively wrecked beyond belief. His face was flushed, his pupils fully dilated. His breaths were coming in ragged gasps. It still boggled her that it was she who did this to him.AANeither one of them had moved, both too lost in the moment. She nudged his nose with her own, closing her eyes before opening them again and meeting his. He wasn’t deducing her, wasn’t studying her, he was simply looking at her, admiring her.AA“I love you.” His voice was a gravelly whisper.AAShe smiled at him as she reached up with her hand and stroked his jaw line with her thumb, “I love you too.”AAHe smiled back at her before capturing her lips with his own. As they continued to kiss he shifted his body until he was directly hovering above her. Reaching out he grabbed at her leg, hooking it up over his hip. She whimpered into his mouth then moaned as he brushed himself against her wet center.AABreaking apart their kiss, with his lips just over hers he slipped his hand down between their bodies and guided himself in to her. His eyes were locked on hers, watching as they widened slightly as he entered her. It took a few shallow thrusts before he was fully seated inside of her. He stilled his movements, reveling in the sensation of her surrounding him. She took a hold of his face and brought him down to her for a heated kiss. He began to move again.AAGrabbing on to both her legs he continued to thrust into her. Her knees were bent now; he pushed her legs on top of his back, her ankles crossing over. The angle of his thrusts changed, he was in her deeper now, the tip of him hitting the spot that always sent her over the edge.AAHer nails were digging into his arse as he pressed kisses on to the milky white underside of her breasts. She was moaning loudly, bucking up her hips to his, meeting him thrust for thrust. She was starting to shudder around him, a sure sign that she was close. With a gentle nip with his teeth, he moved his tongue across her distended nipple. The slight shock of pain sent her into orgasm. She cried out, throwing her head back, exposing her pale neck to him. He was certain she was seeing stars. All it took were a few more thrusts and he joined her. He emptied himself into her, thrusting shallowly a few more times before bringing himself to a standstill.AAThey laid there, clinging to each other, both panting heavily. He lifted up his head; he had dropped it to her shoulder as his own orgasm took over. He was still inside of her, her ankles still crossed over his back. She moved her hands over his skin, stopping when she reached his shoulders. He kissed her slowly, basking in their shared afterglow.AAAfterglow. A perfect word. It described exactly how she looked to him; glowing. She was glowing. He kissed her again, this time a bit more deeply. She shifted her hips slightly and he let out a soft groan. He couldn’t possibly be ready for another round, could he?AA“If this is how I am to be treated when I have a bad day, then I may try to have bad days more often.” Molly said to him.AASherlock chuckled against her mouth as he kissed her again, “Anything to make you feel better. I do not like an unhappy Molly.”AA“Hmmmm … is that because I have the tendency to make your life a living hell when I’m upset?”AAHis mouth had started to wander, placing kisses here and there on her body, “Mmm … yes.”AAIt was her turn to chuckle. She bucked her hips, moving him inside of her. He let out another muffled groan.AA“You want me again?”AAHe gave her a thrust, beginning to grow hard once more.AA“I always want you.”AAHe kissed her, “Always want you too.”AAShe could feel him lengthening in her. Moving a hand down between them she gave him a few strokes with her fingertips, before touching her own sensitive spot. He surged forward, fully hard now, pressing her hand between their joined bodies. She moaned loudly.AAPulling out he gently nudged her hand away before thrusting forward once more. After several more thrusts he pushed down on her knees until they hit the mattress, moving her ankles until they were resting against the back of his neck.AA“All right?” He questioned her hoarsely, making sure she wasn’t uncomfortable.AAShe nodded in reply. He pulled himself out of her almost entirely before slipping back in with one solid thrust. She practically screamed as she grabbed at his back. He had entered into her far deeper than he ever had before, and at an entirely new angle. The sensation was almost too much for the pair of them. But it felt so incredibly good. Neither of them lasted very long, both coming in unison. She screamed out his name, her legs shaking as she convulsed around him. He came with a garbled cry, chanting her name into her skin.AAHe rolled off of her, collapsing down beside her. They were both absolutely sated and spent, for now. Minutes passed before they were able to catch their breath. Molly was the first to move. She slid towards Sherlock as he turned his head to her. Their lips met. They kissed lazily, both too tired for anything more.AA“Thank you.” She murmured to him.AAHe smiled against her mouth before pulling her up against him and grabbing the duvet to cover them. With one final kiss they both closed their eyes and proceeded to fall asleep.AA---AAIt was late morning when Molly woke. Her body ached slightly, a flood of memories surging forward in her mind. She sighed softly, remembering how good Sherlock had made her feel. Tilting her head she felt his nose bump against her ear. That was when she realized that his arm was draped across her, his hand just below her left breast. She turned in towards him, until they were nose to nose. His hand had managed to slip down to her arse. His eyes were still closed, his breathing pattern hadn’t changed. When the man needed sleep it was almost impossible to wake him up. Almost.AAPushing the duvet away from them, she smiled cheekily to herself at the thought of what she was about to do. Keeping her eyes locked on his face she moved her hand downwards until it reached her desired target. She watched for any sign of him waking up as she began to stroke him with her fingers. She could see movement beneath his eyelids, his mouth had opened slightly, and his breathing had deepened, but yet still he did not awaken. He was fully hard now, heavy in her hand. Stopping the movements with her fingers she slipped her body down the mattress until she became level with him. Ever so slowly she took the tip of him in to her mouth and gave it a gentle suck, moving her tongue over it.AA“Molly!”AAHer name was spoken in a garbled gasp. His eyes were fully opened and he was looking down at her. His chest was rising and falling as he took deep breaths.AA“What are you doing?”AAShe released him from her mouth and moved back up, placing a finger on his lips.AA“Shhh … just lie back and relax.”AAAfter giving him a kiss she moved back down and took him in between her lips once more. The room filled with the sounds of her mouth working on him and his groans. She knew that he was close, judging by the sounds he was making and the way his hips were stuttering. Reaching up she grabbed his hand and laced their fingers together. She took as much of him in her mouth as she could and gave him one last long, drawn out suck. He cried out as he came, his hand holding tightly on to hers. He fell back against the pillows, breathing deeply.AAOnce she had swallowed every last drop she released him from her mouth. With his hand still clasping hers he pulled her up, and cradled her face with his other hand as he kissed her deeply. She smiled at him as they broke apart to breathe.AA“Thank you.”AAShe pressed her forehead to his, “Last night was …” She shook her head, knowing that no word would suffice to describe it. So she kissed him instead.AAHe held her close up against him, his fingertips running up and down her spine, as he returned the kiss. Molly was certain that it would never cease to amaze her how different Sherlock could be when it was just the two of them, alone.AAThe walls he had built around himself would crumble and fall away. The cool, contemplative Consulting Detective would disappear, and all that would remain was a very human, man. Yes, he could still act like a petulant child and still have his mood swings, but when he was with her, just her, he allowed his true self to be revealed.AAHe had her pinned down onto her back as they broke their kiss in order to breathe again. Just as his hand began to slip downwards towards her center she grabbed a hold of his fingers and stopped him.AA“Not yet. I need to eat something first.” She kissed the tip of his nose, “And so do you.”AABoth of her hands were on his chest now, she gave him a gentle push and he moved off of her. She pressed a quick kiss to his lips.AA“Wait here.”AAHe watched as she slipped off of the bed and padded out of the room. He greatly admired the fact that she was in no way embarrassed by her nakedness. He laid there for some minutes listening to her moving about in the kitchen. The smell of chocolate drifted into the room, followed by a hint of coffee.AAA few more minutes passed before she came walking back in, bearing a tray. She set it down on the bed, revealing two mugs of coffee and a plate of the cookies she had baked the night before.AAHe sat up as she got back on to the bed and picked up one of the mugs. She held it out to him and he took it, she moved to take up her own mug but he grabbed her wrist and pulled her to him to kiss her. She sighed into his mouth.AAThey leaned against the headboard, mugs in hand, shoulder against shoulder, the plate of cookies on their legs. Neither had spoken for several minutes, both of them just enjoying the quiet.AASherlock’s hand was resting on Molly’s inner thigh, stroking her skin. She had finished her coffee and had set the mug down on the nightstand. She was now nibbling on a cookie. He had eaten an entire cookie in two bites.AA“These are rather good.”AAShe smiled at him then noticed that he had a bit of chocolate on the corner of his mouth. Wiping it away with her fingertip she licked it off, smiling again as he watched her. He set his mug down then shoved the tray away from, and grabbed the plate of cookies, placing it by his side. She narrowed her eyes at him.AA“What are you doing?”AAHe smiled at her and took her hand, tugging downwards until she laid down on her back. She watched as he dipped a fingertip into the still melted chocolate on one of the cookies.AA“I think I found something to do with this.”AAHovering his hand over her for a second he then slowly dropped it down and smoothed the chocolate over her skin, coating her nipple.AA“Ohhh …” she breathed out.AAHis mouth quickly replaced his finger, sucking the chocolate off. She whimpered as he pulled away to repeat the same action upon her other breast.AA“Mmmm delicious.”AAHe repeated this several more times, causing her to make soft noises of pleasure.AA“Molly?”AAShe didn’t answer for several seconds, “Ye-es?”AAHis mouth was still on her nipple, teasing her with his teeth.AA“When do you have to go in to work today?”AAMore chocolate on her skin, now around her navel. There would be a visible love bite there, later.AA“Not until … ohhhh … not until tonight. I’m working the … mmmm … the graveyard shift. OH!”AAShe could practically feel him smirking in to her skin. She let out a sound of disappointment as he moved his mouth away from her. Opening up her eyes, which had closed due to his ministrations, she looked down at him. His lips were glistening slightly.AA“Good.” He raised an eyebrow, “Do you have anymore of this chocolate?”",Orgasms and Chocolate Chip Cookies,4207

Down the hall he could hear the same... chord... start over... again. Whoever was playing wasn’t bad. And he could appreciate practice. But not at three in the morning. He glanced at the phone by the bed and briefly considered calling in a favor. No, no, the idea was to pass as a regular college student. So he could handle his own obnoxious neighbor. Throwing on a robe and slippers, he walked into the hall. It was easy to find the source of the noise, especially as the door was slightly ajar. Pushing it open he was momentarily caught by the very good looks of the young man. No. Shaking his head he moved into the room, noticing it was lived in, but not horribly messy. And apparently the musician had headphones in as he didn’t seem to notice the stranger in his room.Why couldn't he get this damned section right? A short, four godforsaken bars had consumed more of Greg’s time than they really should have, and yet his fingers continued to stumble clumsily over the frets. He growled in frustration and resisted the urge to throw down his guitar, the single most expensive item he owned, as he stood up, the free coffee in the lobby calling to his tired eyes. He nearly dropped his guitar anyway at the sight of the attractive redhead in his open doorway, looking more adorable in a tartan dressing gown and slippers and angry glare than he guessed the young man usually did. ""Bonjour, étranger,"" (Hello, stranger) he greeted in the easy French he’d inherited from his father with the charming smile he’d inherited by his mother to hide the sudden, surprised pounding of his heart.Mycroft had several thoughts at once regarding that smile, at least two of which involved shoving him back on the bed. Instead he crossed his arms and glared. ""It is three in the morning,"" he informed him, easily answering in French himself. The information surprised Greg into dropping the smile and spinning to squint at the clock on the bedside. “Fuck,” he breathed, turning back around as he ran his free hand through his hair. “Fuck, I’m sorry. I got so caught up in...” His eyes narrowed at the young man. He seemed posh enough to have played some sort of classical instrument, with fingers like that, maybe a piano, but chances were just as likely that he’d never touched an instrument at all. “My mum and dad are having a renewal ceremony or something in two days and I’m just trying to get this right before then but... clumsy fingers,” he chuckled, wiggling said digits in the air.Raising an eyebrow, Mycroft gestured for the guitar. Surprised, the stranger handed it over. Mycroft had taken a few lessons a couple years back, but like anything else he’d found he was good at picking things up by ear once he knew the basics. And after listening to the same bars for the last four hours he at least had an idea where the other man was going with it. He took a moment to settle the guitar in his hands, then made an attempt at the bars. By the third one he had the chords right, judging by the surprised expression on the man’s face. “Like this. I do believe you keep slipping off this fret here,” he said, showing him. The musician moved closer and Mycroft got a whiff or something delicious. Swallowing, he handed the guitar back. “Good night,” he said, turning to go before he got himself in trouble.“Wait!” Greg called before the man could disappear out the door entirely. For a bloke in a robe and slippers, he moved with a ridiculous amount of speed and grace. The redhead (were those freckles? Oh god, he was in trouble) turned with an arched eyebrow, expression imperious and impatient. Maybe he was out of his league, but he’d already jumped in with both feet and it was time to swim. Plus, he didn’t come back over to France very often, may as well have a bit of fun before he had to go back to London. “Since you’re already up, how about a terrible cup of lobby coffee?” he offered with a grin.He should say no, should go right back to bed. But those deep brown eyes and brown hair… well he was in France, after all. Wasn’t the point to have a bit of fun? (Not that Mycroft Holmes had ever been particularly good at relaxing.) “Very well,” he said. There was something slightly off about the other man’s accent, as if French wasn’t what he spoke every day. Curious. He could probe further over that cup of coffee. “However, I do believe there is an all night coffee shop a block away. I will meet you in the lobby.”“Even better,” he said, grin still in place as he watched the stranger move out of the door. Though the young man seemed a bit on the heavier side, something Greg hoped he would be able to explore in detail shortly, he moved in a amazingly self-assured manner, one that made his jeans uncomfortably tight. The fact that he’d been wearing a bathrobe when he’d come to reprimand Greg didn’t mean anything though, and neither did the acceptance of coffee; the redhead could just be looking for recompense for the hours of guitar music. Not that he would blame the man, but he had rather hoped for a bit of fun this holiday. Starting as he remembered he had a bit of a deadline, he ran a hand over his jeans and his ratty shirt, double-checked that he was even wearing shoes, snagged his wallet and jacket, and jogged out the door and down into the lobby.Even on holiday, Mycroft wore proper trousers, not jeans. He found himself looking in the mirror twice as he buttoned up his shirt. It was only coffee, he reminded himself, nothing more. He poked self-consciously at his stomach and made a mental promise to avoid the sweets before grabbing his own jacket and heading down to the lobby. Greg was a little surprised to find the other man not waiting for him when he arrived, but when he walked in, he understood why. It was unusual to see someone that young wearing something that dapper, but it really did suit him: a stark white button-up under a grey, proper tweed? wool? waistcoat and matching trousers were accompanied by a brolly of all things, despite the clear sky and the early hour. “Hello, stranger,” he said for the second time, same smile on his face and his heart accelerated, but no longer pounding. Offering his hand, Mycroft smiled. ""Mycroft Holmes."" The other young man looked rough around the edges still, but ruggedly handsome with the scruff on his cheeks. It was certainly making his body react. Of course he was attracted to a 'bad boy.'“Greg Lestrade,” he replied, gripping the offered hand firmly. It was only as Mycroft was pulling his hand away that Greg realised how soft his palm and fingers were, and the tips of his own fingers trailed and lingered along the other’s.Greg’s hand was surprisingly smooth, though his fingers were calloused from the guitar. He didn’t miss the lingering touch either. Intriguing, certainly. Despite the hour, he found himself wanting to get to know Greg better as he looked at those deep brown eyes, finally swallowing as he looked away.“So what has you in a place like this?” Greg asked as they began to walk into the cool morning air, mind stalling at the slight dilation he’d seen in the blue eyes. “You look a bit posh to be in a place so... not,” he laughed, feeling oddly giddy in the way one gets out and about at this time of night, when so much of the city was asleep in bed. It was a feeling he never grew tired of. He took a deep breath of the cool air, loving the smell of the city around him and body near-vibrating with restraint to keep himself from jumping and hollering.“Just on holiday.” He was amused by the energy coming off of Greg. The man probably didn’t need any coffee. A breeze ruffled the other man’s hair and Mycroft nearly stumbled as his imagination conjured a mental image of Greg’s hair bed-mussed in the morning. Licking his lips and swallowing he gestured around. “Paris, after all.”“Ah yes, Paris. As the American’s say, ‘The city of love’.” His smile to the redhead was less than subtle, and neither was the wink he sent the other man’s way as the cafe came into view. Greg jogged forward the extra few steps and opened the door with a flourish, one arm completing the bow inwards.Mycroft blushed slightly, accepting the invitation. “Please, let me pay,” he insisted as the yawning young man behind the counter waited for them to order.They were soon settled at a corner table, legs and feet tangled underneath as they sipped their coffees. Maybe it was the hour, or the city, but Mycroft was captivated, and he strongly suspected Greg felt the same way. He let three fingers of one hand come to rest on Greg’s wrist, wondering just where the dawn would find them.     “So, Mycroft, what do you do?” Greg asked curiously, stretching out his legs under the table and boldly sliding them the other’s. Not that those soft fingertips curling around his pulse were any less so. He grinned and turned his hand around, tangling their fingers as he sipped the hot coffee as nonchalant as could be. Partially because he was actually thirsty and a bit tired, but also because it hid his grin at the light flush building under those slightly pale, freckled cheeks.""I'm in university,"" Mycroft said carefully. ""How about yourself?"" He squeezed the warm palm under his own, flushing as he wondered about those hands and what they could do. It had been a long while since he'd allowed himself a lover. Longer still since he'd wanted anyone this way. Maybe there was something about Paris.“Same. For now,” Greg replied easily, his mind flitting to the classes he’d been considering. It wasn’t a career either of his parents would be happy about, and it didn’t fit in with how he and the rest of his mates tended to act, but it had slowly become something more and more important to him and something he was becoming more and more sure that he would pursue. He jostled himself out of his own mind, realising he was leaving the other behind and smiled brightly. “Well, it sounds like we’re both in Paris for holiday, My. What do you say we have a little fun with each other while we’re here?” And if his offer wasn’t subtle enough, he held blue eyes with his own as he lifted the soft hand clutching his and pressed a kiss to the back of it.My. He never let anyone shorten his name. Well except Mummy, though he hadn't given up trying to argue with her. But from Greg's soft lips, it didn't seem so bad. ""I do suppose 'a little fun' wouldn't be so bad. And at least it would prevent any further early morning guitar practice."" He gave a smile and leaned forward, licking his lips again. The guitarist eagerly took the silent invitation, nearly knocking the table over in his hurry to get his mouth over the other's. Mycroft's mouth, as Greg invaded it with his tongue, tasted deliciously sweet, barely bitter even after a full cup of coffee. He tried to remember what the redheaded had ordered to make his mouth so addictive, only to quickly realised that right now, nothing mattered less. It was just short of plundering, the way his slick muscle curled and wrapped. It made him wish that they had never left the hotel, so that instead of having to keep half his attention on the coffee cup and plate strewn table between them, he could devote all his attention to freely wrapping and curling his tongue around whatever part of the redhead he desired.Only barely biting back a moan, Mycroft pulled away from Greg. “I do believe my room is closer. I’m certain the gentleman behind the counter would appreciate us taking this elsewhere.” Under the table he grasped and squeezed Greg’s knee, resisting the urge to move his hand higher, and instead, finding his feet and offering Greg his hand.As soon as that palm landed in his, Greg pulled the other man in tight against him, holding him close like a waltz and dancing over to press his back to the counter. ""I don't know about that,"" he said in a low voice against My's ear, not missing the shiver. ""I think he may like to join."" He bit down gently on the soft lobe as he winked jauntily at the attendant. He received a scandalous look from the man behind the counter for his unnecessary, and likely unwelcome, flirtation, and promptly burst into laughter as he dragged the flushed and flustered redhead out the door.Somehow, Mycroft kept himself from dragging Greg into the nearest alley as they made their way back to the hotel. But the other man’s hand was warm in his, and he leaned in to nibble his neck as they hurried back. They rushed through the lobby and up the stairs. Mycroft’s room was close to the stairwell (thank goodness) and he unlocked his door, nearly dropping his key as Greg’s hands wrapped around his waist. Then they were falling through the entryway. Mycroft used his umbrella to get the door closed as he stumbled towards the bed.""Handy,"" Greg complimented as his fingers tugged at the little discs of that tweed (wool?) waistcoat. Somehow, they'd gotten turned around and now he was the one pushing the other young man down onto the bed, tripping after him as Greg's scrambled attempt at quickly undressing himself quickly hobbled his own thighs and knees. He was still laughing though, exhilarated, giddy, and it wasn't long before My was joining in. Between their four hands, they were both naked in no time.Heart racing, Mycroft looked up at Greg. Perhaps he was being foolish. He didn’t know the man at all, other than a predilection for the guitar at all hours of the morning. But there was something solid and sweet that made him want to know more. He leaned up for a kiss before gesturing at a toiletry bag on the dresser. “There’s lube and condoms,” he said. Being prepared never hurt, even if this was unexpected.“Any flavoured lube?” Greg asked as he nearly fell off the bed in his hurry to get to the supplies. At the sputtered sound, he looked over his shoulder and laughed anew at the red cheeks and wide eyes even as he dug through the bag by feel. “Maybe next time,” he said with a wink, finally locating the small plastic tube. Holding up the link of foil squares, he asked cheekily, “Think we should save any for tomorrow or should we just go buy more?”""I think you need to come over here and take me,"" growled Mycroft, wrapping a hand around himself. ""Unless I am reading you wrong and you prefer to watch."" God the man was handsome with that warm smile and easy laugh. Greg practically tackled the other man, knocking Mycroft’s hand free of his own cock and pressing their lips together in a sloppy kiss. Their cocks, damp from precome, slid against one another as he wrapped a hand around the both them. He had noticed the redhead was circumcised to his uncircumcised, and the difference in sensation was fascinating. He wrapped a hand around the back of My’s neck and broke off the kiss to press their foreheads together, looking down to where their cocks were sliding together. “Beautiful,” he whispered, relishing the way the sparks from the friction had ignited a fire in his groin and the base of his spine.Mycroft watched his face, rocking together before taking a kiss, too impatient to savor it. There would be time for more kisses. Right now he just needed Greg.Regrettably, Greg shifted away back onto his knees, reaching to the side to grab the lube. The bottle was a little difficult to open one-handed, but he didn't quite feel ready to release the hold he held on their cocks, even if it made things more difficult. The lubricant was cold when it drizzled over their sensitive flesh, making the both of them hiss, but it wasn't long before the movements of his hand warmed the viscous liquid. The feel of their cocks pressed together as they fucked the slick circle of his fist was nearly beyond his control. He dropped the condom on My's chest and breathed ""Open it.""Mycroft used his hands to rip it open. He noticed his fingers trembled as he shifted away so that he could roll it onto Greg's cock. He wanted that cock inside of him as much as he wanted to simply come against Greg's hand. He leaned in and nipped his lower lip, spreading his legs for his lover. ""Do what you will.""""Never been a problem."" Greg's fingers weren't as gentle as they normally would have as he pressed two into the redhead's tight hole. My cried and bucked and Greg only grinned wider, pumping his fingers roughly and barely waiting for the edges to loosen before pressing in a third. The softer man winced and went quiet, still, and tight around and under him, and he automatically slowed, pressing a kiss to the inside of one knee. ""Sorry,"" he whispered, gentling his fingers. ""Clumsy fingers."" My laughed at the reference to earlier in the night and relaxed around him.Mycroft smiled at him and reached out to run a hand through Greg’s hair. “It’s all right.” The truth was he really didn’t mind the roughness. He rocked against the fingers inside of him, needing more. The dark eyes were nearly black with lust.""Good, because they're not inclined to move far from you soon,"" he laughed, finally pulling his fingers free and shuffling into place. Even resting against the tight hole, the tip of his cock was being heated in a way that made him lose enough control to just thrust forward. His jaw was gritted against the heat and the vice-like grip, but still a hoarse shout pushed out from between his teeth at the overwhelming sensation.Groaning, Mycroft’s head rocked back, hands scrabbling down Greg’s back. So full, and so good. He moaned as his lover started to thrust, even the barrier of the condom doing little to temper their sensitivity. He grasped his own cock, Greg’s thrusts driving him into his own hand, head tossing with the pleasure of the moment, Greg’s breath hot against his skin.""Do you not... 'have fun' very often?"" he asked through still-gritted teeth. The other man was tighter around him than anyone he'd had in quite some time, probably as tight as the last virgin he'd spent a night with. It was hard to not just come instantly.“No,” panted Mycroft. “Not often at all. I am….choosy about my partners.” He wondered if Greg knew just how special he was. He could tell how hard the man was fighting not to come already. Wickedly, he squeezed around him.""Fuck!"" Greg shouted, hips slamming forward so firmly that the bed jolted and hit the wall. My shouted wordlessly, fingernails digging into to Greg's shoulders so hard that it felt like scarring was imminent. The brunette dropped his head to a pale, sweat-dampened collarbone, panting hard as he fought to keep still in order to stave off his orgasm. When he felt as if he'd wrested enough back, he pulled out just a little and rolled his hips smoothly, sliding back inside and groaning an open-mouthed kiss against the lightly-freckled skin below his mouth.Panting, Mycroft buried his hands in his hair. “Now we’ve probably woken the rest of the hotel,” he purred in Greg’s ear before nipping at the shell of it. Greg felt so perfect above him, hot and warm and filling him over and over again. Mycroft’s eyes fell shut as he concentrated on the feel of him, his own orgasm building.""If we haven't, well then, I'm not trying hard enough."" Greg didn't give My enough time to answer before he began studiously searching for his lover's prostate. His fingers gripped the sheets tightly as he kept adjusting the angle of hips, looking for the expression or sound to indicate he'd found it; when he did, My’s reaction was far from subtle. The redhead nearly screamed as his nails scored lines of broken skin down Greg's back and his hole clamped around his cock so viciously that the guitarist's vision went white as he came with a surprised, hoarse shout.Mycroft clung to Greg, throat sore as he slowly came back to himself. Vaguely, he was aware of the scratches under his hands. ""Sorry,"" he muttered. He was worried maybe he’d done more damage then Greg would have liked. It had just been so very long since anyone had made him feel this way. And he found himself craving more. “Not a problem,” Greg said with a smile. “I consider it a great compliment when I can get someone as quiet and controlled as you to let go so thoroughly. Though,"" he paused to lean down for a slow kiss as he pulled out and knotted the condom, tossing it to the side, ""I can't say I've seen or heard someone do it so prettily before."" When he pulled back, the redhead looked positively debauched and his spent cock gave a twitch in protest.Mycroft smiled softly at him, reaching up to curl a strand of hair in his fingers. ""You're unlike anyone else,"" he said again, meaning it more than he ever had. ""I've always prefered it that way,"" Greg admitted, finally falling to his side and sprawling on his back on the sheets and pillows My curled towards him, resting his ear over the brunet's heart and his long, soft fingers on the man's belly. ""Special snowflake, and all that shit,"" he murmured, feeling exhaustion pull at him as he curled an arm under the plush form splayed across him and used his other hand to interlace their fingers together.Mycroft slept better than he had in ages. He still woke early, leaning up to kiss Greg gently, shifting to straddle him. A warmth settled over his hips, a scorching heat pressed to the root of his already-hard cock drawing him enticingly from sleep. Greg's fingers found knees on either side of his hips and he palmed them, sliding his hands up soft thighs that made him hum. ""So you know, I am in no way opposed to laying right here and not opening my eyes if you condom and lube me, and you fuck yourself on my cock.""""Lazy,"" teased Mycroft, opening the lube bottle and reaching back to finger himself, giving a theatrical moan, even as he shivered under Greg's touch. The guitarist gave a noncommittal groan and occupied his hands with petting the smooth skin over taut thighs as he listened with one eager ear for all the tiny sounds slipping past his lover's control and out from between his lips. It wasn't soon enough before latex was rolled down his length and a wet heat followed right behind the unrolling circle. Unable to stop himself, Greg curled his fingers tight into the meat of My's thigh as he threw his head back, groaning low in his throat. ""God, yesss..."" he breathed as the weight over him settled firmly, his cock embraced from tip to base by that dizzingly-tight grip.Mycroft planted his hands on Greg's firm chest and began to move. The brunette was gorgeous underneath him and he leaned in to nibble on his exposed throat as he took his time, drawing it out for both of them. He kissed up Greg's scruffy jaw before pulling back and moving a little faster. Greg was growing more and more awake as the minutes passed, even as his muscles grew more tense with building pleasure. It took effort to remain pliant under the other man, but worth it to see and feel the way My worked his cock with that plush arse. He slid one hand across the other's pelvis, dancing his fingertips down the bobbing erection and smearing come across the head with his thumb. The redhead's rhythm faltered and he whined, removing one hand from Greg's chest to grab his cock. Greg smacked it away and put the escaped hand back against his chest, keeping it there and palm down with his own hands circling the thin wrists. ""I want to watch you come on my cock,"" he breathed.A ragged moan broke from Mycroft. He shifted and looked down at Greg, gasping as he brushed his prostate. This was amazing. And for Greg to just let him do this... he’d met too many tops that only wanted to dominate. Everything was another check in this man’s favor. Groaning, he moved faster, loving the feel of Greg’s hands on his wrists.""God, that's it, mon cher,"" (my dear) he groaned, flexing his arse and hips, bouncing the man in his lap with just the barest bit of pressure of feet against the bed. My's fingers curled, creating crescents of pain on his chest amongst the pleasure as he writhed and bucked endlessly on Greg's cock. Each time his prostate was nudged, it made the walls around him pulse and the fingers convulse until they were both almost wild with pleasure.In some ways Mycroft didn’t want it to end, but it had to. With a groan, he came hard, coating Greg’s chest with his seed, head falling forward and his eyes closing and the world seemed to shift. The thought, unbidden, entered his mind. I would shift my world for this man. It was jarring to think it. After all, he didn’t even really know him. He tried to keep his sudden anxiety from showing in his features.The feel of My coming around him, the sight of his head dropping forward and his cock pulsing his release all over Greg's belly made the dark haired man's entire body tense as he came with a harsh groan, unable to keep his hips from thrusting up into the lax body over him to wring out every last bit of his orgasm. When he finally stilled, My tipped forward like he didn't have the strength to sit up any longer and Greg helped him down to the side. Mycroft was trembling as he lay against Greg, wondering again just what he was doing. Greg’s hands smoothed down his side, planting a kiss on his forehead. Mycroft shifted and kissed him back. “This is wonderful,” he said softly, “but I may need to take things slower. It is nothing against you, Gregory.” He was fairly certain that was the man’s full name.Greg blinked in surprise at his full name and tilted his head down to look at his lover. My was carefully not looking at him and he nodded. ""All right,"" he said slowly. He'd thought things were going well, but he had to remember this wasn't going to last. Suddenly, the pleasure from his release faded, washed away by an unwelcome and unexpected sobriety that was still no less understood. Where did they go from here? Would My (Mycroft) leave? Would they just go back to sleep? The man was still laying against him, but Greg's entire body was tense, waiting for the inevitable escape that didn't usually happen until the visitor knew he had fallen asleep.Mycroft could feel his tension and guilt wormed in his heart. He raised his head and kissed Greg. “It is not you,” he assured, running his hands down the man’s chest.”You were right when you said I didn’t ‘have fun’ often.” He brought one of Greg’s hands to his mouth and kissed it, seeking out his eyes. “You are special, Gregory. This feels like more than a one night stand. I simply want to get to know you better.”At the redhead’s words, the tension in his body eased and Greg slid his hand out of the other’s grip, only to cup the soft jaw as he leaned in for a slow kiss. “Okay. That’s fine,” he murmured between brushes of their lips. “Just as you’re not trying to bail on me already.”“Not at all.” Mycroft said against his kiss. “You are a treasure, Gregory Lestrade.” Just then his stomach growled and he pulled back with a smile. “Perhaps breakfast is in order.”“I think you’re right.” With an exaggerated groan that made him feel older than he was, Greg rolled over and lifted himself off the bed. Their clothes were scattered every which way and it was with a comfortable silence that they picked up pieces and tossed them to one another. It felt a little odd, putting on grungy clothes, especially over the dried mess on his body, but he didn’t particularly feel like a mad dash to his room in just his pants, so with a sigh, he pulled on the bare minimum before ducking over to pull My into a kiss. “I’m going to take a shower and I’ll meet you in the lobby, yeah?”""Certainly."" Mycroft smiled at him and touched his cheek. Only a minute after door clicked shut the phone by his bed rang. Work (he'd started working for the government even though he was still completing his studies). And they needed him immediately. A car was waiting outside. ""Of course,"" said Mycroft as he ran a hand through his hair and hung up the phone. He quickly tossed his things into his bag, not wanting to go, but it did seem to be an emergency. He grabbed the hotel stationary and scribbled a quick note, hating to leave like this. He could hear the shower running so he slipped the note under Greg's door and hurried down to meet the car. It wasn’t usual for him to rush his showers, but with the promise of the gorgeous redhead waiting in the lobby for him, Greg viciously scrubbed his hair and body clean, hardly even waiting for the water to warm. He wasn’t even sure he was dry when he started throwing on the few clean clothes he’d picked out of his suitcase, glad that he’d at least had it all folded so it wasn’t entirely composed of wrinkles. His shirt and jeans stuck to his skin, made clammy by the damp, as he one-footed his way out the door, trying to shuffle on socks and shoes one handed. He knew he was grinning broadly as he jogged to the lobby, but it faded when he realised My wasn’t there. Realistically though, the man was incredibly well put-together, something that must take some time. But when he realised he’d been waiting for half an hour, he became concerned.The jog to My’s room was short, as was Greg’s knock on the door. “My?” he called through the wood. He waited, but there was no answer and no sound from inside. He tried again, knocking harder and calling louder. “MY?” Still, nothing. Though he hadn’t known the other very long, it didn’t quite seem like the posh bloke to do something like this. Maybe he was already waiting at the cafe? But even as Greg jogged out the small hotel and towards the small eatery, he could see the window seat they’d been using was just as empty.Even though he was grasping at straws, the guitarist still felt driven to check with the front desk, and he hurried back, his breath coming in pants as he stopped in front of the desk. “Hey, I’m looking for my friend? Mycroft Holmes from 2C? He was supposed to meet me down here.” The bored-looking attendant stirred at finally being given a purpose and checked the log book.“He was checked out approximately an hour and a half ago.” Greg frowned. That would have been right after he’d left My’s room.“Did he leave a note for me?” he asked. The attendant shook her head and Greg walked away in a confused daze. Sure it was a agreed to be a simple, holiday fling, but he’d thought that, perhaps, something was growing between them. Something tangible, long-lasting. But the cleaning woman ducking into the redhead’s room (old) room only confirmed it was actually over. Another one was bowing her way out of his room and he thanked her with a nod and a forced smile. Greg simply stood in the doorway for a long minute after the door closed behind him and his eyes fell on his guitar. The one that had introduced him to My in the first place. The one that, even if he picked up now, wouldn’t bring the other man back. With a heavy sigh, he sat on the edge of the bed and picked it up anyway, and resumed his practice.Greg never called. Mycroft regretted leaving like he did, but nothing could be done now. Work threw him straight into a week of nonstop meetings and there was little time to dwell until he was back on campus and alone in his room. He called the hotel in Paris, wondering if perhaps Greg had left a message. But nothing had been left and he'd paid in cash so he had no way to find the man. Still, when the holidays came he half-hoped... But nothing. Mycroft tried to put him out of his mind (though he couldn't bring himself to delete the night entirely) and get on with his life. He was very careful to not let anyone get so close again. ATWENTY YEARS LATERAThe wood of his guitar was chilled from its time in its case. After all, he only brought it out once a year nowadays; after uni, and after convincing his remaining family and friends that he really did want to be a copper for the rest of his life, he'd thrown all his time and energy into achieving that goal. And now that he'd made Detective Inspector, he had less time than ever for his long-time hobby. But this one day, this one song, he'd always make time for.Greg took a sip of his wine and stroked a finger down the side of the framed picture of his parents on the night of their vow renewal. He had played a song for them that night, one he had practiced for weeks on, and had only gotten the last bit right thanks to a stranger from down the hall in the hotel he'd been staying at. He'd managed a one-day whirlwind romance with the now-faceless 'My' before the redhead (he remembered that much) disappeared as quickly as he'd appeared. Two days later, on their second honeymoon, his parents died in a boating accident. He had been glad his temporary lover had gotten out when he had; souring a lovely holiday fling with mourning was not on. Life went on though, and every year on his parent's anniversary, he played their song for them, and then retired early, mind unerringly going to his one-day fling.Suddenly, there was a firm, persistent knock on the door and Greg sighed explosively, angry to have this evening of all evenings interrupted. Reverently, he put placed the guitar on the couch and stalked over to the door as another knock sounded. ""God dammit, Sherlock!"" he shouted at the young man he could picture just on the other side of the door. Idiot had been showing up at crime scenes in various stages of sobriety, insisting that he be let in to investigate. Greg never failed to turn him away, and Sherlock never failed to show up in the most ridiculous places, aiming for a 'yes'. ""I'm not going to change my mind!"" he continued, reaching for the door knob and flinging the door open. ""You are not allowed on my crime sce--"" The man on the other side of the door was distinctly not Sherlock, red-haired, freckled, dressed in an expensive grey wool suit with an umbrella hooked over his arm. Something about his face looked familiar, and niggled at his memory, but he couldn't seem to place it. ""Do I know you?""ATWENTY MINUTES EARLIERAThese days Mycroft's other occupation seemed to be trying to keep his younger brother from overdosing or otherwise ending up dead in alley somewhere. So when he'd shown up on Mycroft's doorstep, ranting about how the police were all idiots, he'd brought him into his kitchen, only half listening as he fixed tea. Until Sherlock had spat out the name of the DI. Mycroft felt shot through the heart, but he kept his composure. ""Lestrade you say?"" he asked as he turned and put a cup and saucer in front of Sherlock. ""Does he have a first name?""""Gavin? Gareth? Starts with a G. It doesn't matter,"" growled Sherlock. For once, Mycroft was glad he was half out of his mind and too busy being angry to really look at him. ""They need me and he won't let me help. They've been trying to solve this spate of crimes for nearly three weeks now. I could have solved it already if this Inspector allowed me access.""""Perhaps I could speak with him,"" said Mycroft. Sherlock snorted, then gave him a suddenly penetrating look. ""You know him."" It wasn't a question. ""Perhaps. And if I do it was many years ago.""Opening his mouth to start deducing, Sherlock suddenly slumped in the chair as the tranquilizers Mycroft had slipped in his tea kicked in. Mycroft summoned help from his driver and they got Sherlock into bed with orders to keep an eye on him when he got back from dropping Mycroft at an address. It wasn't the best neighborhood. It hadn't taken much work to find the man's location and a quick look at his records. He'd done well in his career, though his personal life had been something of a mess. His driver showed some hesitation at leaving his boss here, but a look from Mycroft sent him off to follow his orders. Mycroft took a deep breath as he headed up the stairs to the flat. He had no idea if he'd be recognized, let alone welcomed. But he had to try. He froze at the soft guitar chords on the other side of the door. If that was an omen, he didn't know if it was good or bad. Steeling himself, he knocked firmly. Of course the Inspector assumed it was Sherlock as he shouted and headed for the door. He flung the door open and stopped. There was the barest hint of recognition. ""Do I know you?""""Bonjour étranger, "" said Mycroft. Greg blinked. He hadn't heard that phrase in years. Not since... not since... red hair blue eyes grey tweed soft skin. ""Mycroft,"" he gasped, memories snapping into place. Heart already heavy with lament and nostalgia, his emotional and self control near nil, and he surged forward, pressing his lips to the long-missing man's as he pushed the redhead's back to the wall opposite his door.Mycroft moaned. Oh God. He buried his hands in the now-gray hair. Greg's body was still solid against his. And it felt like the intervening twenty years had never happened. Even after all this time, Greg still felt right. A strong thigh pushed between his legs and he rutted against him like a teenager, opening his mouth to his probing tongue, for once in his life not even caring about the public display.""If I remember right, we never got to the 'public sex' bit of our affair,"" Greg growled, rocking his hips (and his erection) forward, moving mouth, teeth, and tongue down Mycroft--My's-- jaw and neck. ""Fancy adding that on now?"" he asked with a grin, grinding his thigh into the hard erection against it.Mycroft gasped. He'd never done anything of the sort. Hell, he'd barely had a lover, let alone anything dangerous. ""Yes,"" he assented. They should talk, but wanting to take things slow had cost him twenty years already, he wasn't going to wait another twenty. “Yes?” Greg echoed, a little surprised. My nodded and the DI grinned wickedly. “Don’t suppose you have any lube on you?”“I may have grabbed some supplies on my way out the door, just in case. They’re in my left pocket.” Mycroft licked his lips, wanting Greg to hold him against the wall and just take him.The silver-haired man distracted the redhead with another filthy kiss as he reached into the pocket and pulled free a plastic tube. He didn’t catch what it was until he snapped open the lid and smelled the sweet, lemon scent. He blinked in surprise and looked down at the bottle. “‘Lemonade Lubricant’.” Suddenly, he remembered a throwaway comment years ago about flavoured lube. “You remembered,” he said, voice a bit faint in surprise.Mycroft reached to touch his cheek. “I have never forgotten.” Greg looked back up at him and Mycroft met his eyes. “I am sorry,” he said, feeling his heart ache with all the lost time.“Me too,” Greg replied softly. “But I need to be inside you right now, then we can talk.” My nodded as the DI undid his button and zip, pulling his trousers and pants down even as he turned the other man to face the wall. The liquid he poured into his fingers was lukewarm at best from being in the other man’s pocket, and he warmed it one-handed as he pocketed the bottle before palming the smooth, pale arse. “Still as soft,” he murmured into an equally soft neck, reaching between them to press a finger into the tight hole.Mycroft tried to muffle the moan against his arm. It had been more than a year since the last time he’d slept with anyone. Work and Sherlock took up far too much of his time. Greg’s fingers were insistent but gentle, and he rocked himself back onto them, craving the touch, craving the man’s cock inside of him once again. Everything narrowed down to those fingers and this touch.The hallway was silent except for his lover’s quiet gasps, and Greg occupied his own mouth with the flesh of My’s neck, sucking red marks and dark bruises into the pale skin. It felt like too long before the tight hole felt loose enough for his cock and he paused, three fingers deep. “Do we need a condom?”Forcing himself to pull his head back, Mycroft rest his forehead on his arm. “I am clean. It is up to you.”“Good. I always wondered back then what it would be like to be inside you without one.” My sucked in a breath as Greg pulled his cock free, placing the tip against the wet hole, pausing before he pushed inside. His adrenaline was already spiked by being so exposed, being out in the open, and he thrust quickly, bottoming out in a second. My’s gasp was loud in the hallway and Greg pressed a palm to his mouth, quieting his sounds. His own he muffled against the mottled skin of his lover’s neck as he began thrusting, moving his hips in quick snaps.It was even better than he’d remembered. Mycroft’s eyes were screwed tightly shut, feeling vulnerable here in the hallway, but trusting the man behind him. 'I would shift my life for him.'  It was true then, it was true now. He knew it would always be true. He squeezed around his lover, groaning against his hand.""Shit, mon cher,"" he whispered, orgasm threatening already despite his years of experience; he felt fourteen all over again: on a hair trigger for any new experiences. ""I'm close. Jesus, you're so tight and it feels so good, so soft, so fucking tight.""“Come for me, Gregory,” demanded Mycroft, panting into his palm. He needed to feel him.With a hard thrust, grinding his pelvis against the plush arse, Greg did just that, cock pulsing his release into the burning heat around it. His shout and following groans were muffled by the skin of his lover's neck, and he trembled with the strength of his release. Finally, when everything subsided, My's lips were moving against his palm and Greg pulled his hand away to listen, sweet pleas for friction and release breathed into the wall.Just then there was the sound of a door slamming somewhere else. Mycroft’s eyes went wide and he pushed away from the wall, scrambling for the safety of Greg’s flat. In his haste he tripped over his trousers and landed sprawling face down over the ottoman in front of Greg's couch. His face flushed as Greg burst out laughing. My started to scramble upright and Greg quickly knelt between the spread legs, pushing hard enough on the embarrassed man's arse to keep him in place. ""Sorry, My. Didn't mean to laugh,"" he tried to placate, still smiling. He pulled the lube back out of his pocket and snapped the lid open, pouring the liquid directly onto the damp, pink arsehole. The redhead made a surprised, confused sound as he tried to look over his shoulder, and Greg gave him a cheeky wink before he dove in, thrusting his tongue through the tight ring.Mycroft cried out, trying to muffle his sound. No one had ever done this for him. He spread his legs wider, rutting nearly violently against the ottoman. His mind went blank with the pleasure. It was a lot harder to smirk with one's tongue up someone's arse, but Greg sure as hell felt like he was smirking. It was hard not to, what with the way someone so composed as My still seemed to be falling to pieces under his tongue. The writhing was easy to ride, and despite his age, his cock was already twitching, trying to get hard again. He ignored it in favour of his current life goal: making My come by no other means than his tongue alone.The pleasure was so overwhelming that all Mycroft could do was whimper as he came, staining the ottoman and probably the carpet. His mind was full of Greg and his arse full of that wicked tongue and it had been years since anything had felt this good.Triumphant and smug, Greg pulled his tongue free with a slow lap to the twitching rim before he curled around the front of the ottoman to nuzzle behind My's ear. ""If I still know you like I did back then, then I'd bet you've never let anyone else do that to you before, have you?""Mycroft shook his head. “I don’t trust people,” he muttered, eyes closed, limp and unwilling to move from his spot. “Only you.”“That is incredibly flattering,” Greg murmured. He opened his mouth to say more, but he became suddenly and intensely aware of the acrid sweetness of lemonade lubricant and the faint taste of his own release on his tongue and he grimaced. “Hold that thought. I need to brush my teeth so I can kiss you.” He didn’t bother waiting for an answer before he hopped up, shuffling his trousers and pants off with his toes and stripping off his button up and vest as he walked to the bathroom. He didn’t bother moving quickly either, the weight of that blue gaze like lasers on his arse. He wasn’t as fit as he was twenty years ago, but he was still fresh from street duties and chasing after criminals had kept him more fit than most men his age. Once he was in the toilet though, he scrubbed his teeth hard and fast, and rinsed his mouth out with mouthwash before walking back in. This time, he was able to enjoy the way My’s eyes snapped to his soft cock and stayed there as he walked back over to the other man.Mycroft swallowed hard and dragged his eyes up to Greg’s face. Licking his lips he rolled to his knees and then tried to hitch up his pants as he moved to the couch. “We should speak.” There was so much unsaid, after all.“Yes, we should,” Greg agreed, catching the other man by the waist. “But I think it may be more pleasant if we were both naked.” The redhead seemed to hesitate, but when Greg captured his lips, distracting him with slow kisses, there was no complaint or tension when the DI’s fingers began undoing the buttons of his lover’s overcoat and shirt and helped him out of his clothing and shoes. With My fully naked, Greg settled them onto the couch, interlacing their limbs and simply enjoying the touch of skin against skin. “I think it’s best you start.”“You never called me. I...I left you a note. Did you not see it?” Mycroft swallowed hard.“A note?” His mind struggled to remember that day twenty years ago. “The desk attendant said there wasn’t--” Greg suddenly cut himself off, remembering how much of a hurry he’d been in to leave and the housekeeper who had been leaving his room when he’d come back. He groaned. “Housekeeping,” he growled. Mycroft nodded. “I slipped it under your door. My work, called right after you left.” He reached up to touch his cheek. “When you didn’t call... I thought you weren’t interested, so I never searched for you. But tonight... I had to know.”“Hang on. How did you even find me?” Greg asked, frowning, down at his lover. He’d been so overwhelmed and excited, it didn’t even occur to him till now how unusual it was for someone he hadn’t seen for twenty years to show up on his doorstep. And sure, someone from NSY could have told him, but Greg hadn’t even had a chance to share his secret back then, how much he had wanted to join the police force. How had My known?Mycroft gave a wry smile. “You were half correct when you thought I was Sherlock. He is my younger brother. And it really would benefit you to have in on your crime scenes.”Greg spluttered, caught entirely off guard. “Sherlock? Sherlock is your brother?”Mycroft bit his lip and withdrew his hand, worried. “Yes. He is Sherlock Holmes.”“Holmes!” the DI exclaimed. “Mycroft Holmes! Oh my god. Now I just feel like a wanker. I can’t believe I forgot your last name,” he groaned as he dropped his face to his hand, rubbing the bridge of his nose furiously.Mycroft moved his hands to lean in and kiss him. “It has been a while. And there have been other things to occupy your time.”For a long moment, the silver-haired man allowed the kiss before he broke away, guilt niggling at his mind. “I bet you had just as much. You were important to me, and I couldn’t even do you the courtesy of remembering your name.”“I...looked up your file on the way over. I understand your parents passed away only a few days after our meeting. You can hardly be expected to remember every detail of a few hours assignation.”“Tonight’s their anniversary,” Greg said quietly. “I play for them every year.”Mycroft gathered him in his arms and held him. “I hope that I’m not intruding.”""No... You're not intruding. I think they would have liked you. In fact,"" he murmured, a hazy memory swimming to the surface, ""I think they wanted to meet you. I told them someone helped me get it perfect. They were... suitably interested,"" he chuckled. ""I remembered thinking I was only supposed to fend off a lover's absence only when we were still lovers."" My's disappearance had stung back then, and it had been a fight to keep such a cheery façade up for his parents. Now he could look back on the moment with a warm fondness and soft laughter.“I am so sorry the fates conspired to keep us apart these years. But...perhaps you could play me the song?” Mycroft let go of him so that he could reach for the guitar if he wanted. He really did want to hear it. “And… though we are both busy men, I would like to resume this relationship.”Already reaching for the now-warm wood, Greg stopped and leaned back in for another slow kiss. ""I don't know how much free time I'll have, I suspect it won't be much, but I'd like to spend it with you,"" he whispered against soft lips. The redhead sighed acceptance into his mouth before Greg sat back, disentangling their limbs to give room for the guitar that had brought them together .Mycroft leaned against the arm of the couch. Greg's fingers had become more fluid over the last twenty years, and the beautiful melody they produced filled the room with a quiet melancholy that spoke of the loneliness they'd both endured in their time apart. But perhaps now that they had found one another again, Mycroft could finally have back what had haunted him since the moment he'd first had it.FIN",Once and Again,8950

Thanks for reading!",2014-09-27, Explicit, Sherlock Holmes/John Watson,An undeleted browsing history piques Sherlock's curiosity. He decides to investigate,"Sherlock discovered it this morning, before John woke up.ALast night Sherlock had gone to bed before John who had obviously taken advantage of the alone time for some porn watching and, no doubt, some wanking. This was nothing new; Sherlock knew John did that, had even caught him once. But last night was different.ABecause John didn't delete his browsing history.AOf course, Sherlock looked. All the sites were bondage-based. Submission and domination. This surprised Sherlock very much.AAnd intrigued him. AThey'd never talked much about sexual matters -- obviously Sherlock knew about the porn and wanking and all the dates John was always going on. But he never had John pegged for being into this kind of thing. Some of the films were men and women, some were only men. It was all very intriguing. Which gave Sherlock an idea. He wanted to know which role John was imagining playing as he watched the videos: the dominant or the submissive one. He didn't even know why he wanted to know, but he definitely wanted to figure it out.AHe stood up and turned on the kettle. He waited until he heard John stirring in his room. And then he carried a cup of tea upstairs. He was going to be submissive to John today to see if that's what John liked.AHe knocked on John's bedroom door. ""Tea?"" he called.AJohn sat up properly and stretched as Sherlock came in. ""I was on my way down,"" he murmured, yawning loudly. ""Thank you,"" he smiled, taking the mug from Sherlock. ""What time is it?""A""It's just gone nine,"" Sherlock said. ""Would you like me to make you some breakfast?"" A""Are you going to test something on me?"" John asked. He gasped softly. ""Have you already?""A""No, I just brought you a cup of tea, Mr Paranoid,"" Sherlock said. ""Forget it if you don't want anything. I just thought I'd make breakfast."" A""Breakfast sounds nice,"" John said with a smile. ""Give me a minute and I'll come down and help."" He took a sip of his tea and hummed as he scooted to get off of the bed.A""Don't rush. I'll do it myself. Tell me what you want and I'll do it,"" Sherlock said, trying to watch John's face without John noticing that he was watching.A""Um, just some scrambled eggs and toast is fine."" He took another sip of tea and looked at him suspiciously. ""You didn't burn anything down, did you?"" he teased.A""Don't be ridiculous, the fire alarm would have woken you if I had,"" Sherlock said, turning to leave. Then he stopped and said, ""Tell me again what you want?""A""Scrambled eggs and toast. Sherlock, I can come downstairs,"" he repeated.A""I'll be ready for you to come down whenever you want,"" Sherlock said. ""You're in charge,"" he added as he left.ASo far John didn't seem to be too bothered either way about Sherlock's behaviour. Perhaps he'd be more responsive after he was properly awake. Sherlock moved to the kitchen. Thank god John had said scrambled eggs because that was really the only kind of eggs Sherlock could do. He put a few slices in the toaster and set the table. When John came down, he put the food on a plate for him.A""Here you go, just as you told me to do,"" he said.A""Thanks,"" John smiled, sitting at the table and admiring the meal. ""Not that this isn't fantastic but what's gotten into you? Why're you being so nice?""A""Am I?"" Sherlock asked, sitting down with his tea. ""I thought I was nice all the time.""A""Right. Well . . . you're being extra nice,"" John grinned. ""This is really good, Sherlock. You don't want any?""A""Not hungry,"" Sherlock said. ""So what would you like me to do now?""A""Hmm? Just relax, Sherlock. Don't you have an experiment or anything to work on?"" John asked, wondering where this was coming from all of a suddenASherlock stood up. This was boring. John's only reaction was confused indifference. Either Sherlock was being too subtle or John wasn't interested in domination.A""John,"" he said, ""I will literally do anything you tell me to do right now. Now's your chance at being the boss of me -- do you want to go for it?""A""Um . . . the flat needs to be cleaned up. You should do that,"" John said. For a second it seemed like Sherlock wanted something else -- like he was hinting at something that John was missing. ""You could also go to the shop . . . ""A""I'm not asking you to come up with things that I could do -- I've got plenty of things I could do,"" Sherlock said. ""In fact, cleaning the flat is already on my list. It's #19 so don't you worry about the flat -- it'll get cleaned as soon as I do #1--#18."" He sat back down at the table. ""I was just asking if there's anything you want me to do.""AJohn watched him for a moment, trying to read him the way Sherlock always did. He didn't see anything there -- not anything that would explain this sudden desire to please John. And with the word 'please' his mind went to what he was watching last night and he flushed lightly. ""I -- what else is on your list? So that I don't name something that's already on it again,"" he said. ASherlock sighed a little -- he was getting the feeling this wasn't John's thing. Unless it was just the context? So he ignored John's question and said, ""Should I rub your back?""A""Rub my back?"" John asked. He took a slow breath. Was Sherlock trying to hint that he was a willing submissive? Not the role he would have pictured for someone like Sherlock, but then with him having been a captain maybe Sherlock was thinking the same about him. Maybe if he was going to find out the truth he'd have to be forceful. ""Tell me why you're doing this."" A""Does that mean you want me to keep doing it?"" Sherlock asked.A""Doing what?"" John asked. ""Tell me what you're doing."" ASherlock looked closely at John's face -- for sure he could see curiosity but curiosity was natural for John Watson. It didn't prove anything. So he tried a different strategy. ""No,"" Sherlock said.AJohn's brows furrowed. Was Sherlock still playing or was he wrong? ""If you don't tell me . . . .I'll . . . I'll make Molly lock you out of the morgue for a month."" That was sort of a punishment, but one that could also be made under normal circumstances.A""You couldn't make Molly do that,"" Sherlock said, looking up at John. ""You couldn't make anyone do anything.""A""Yes I could,"" John said indignantly. ""Tell me what you're doing,"" he demanded again. A""Or what?"" Sherlock asked.A""I already told you! I'm going to call her right now,"" John said, getting up to find his phone. If he knew for sure Sherlock wanted to be dominated, he'd have told him that if he doesn't start talking he'd put his mouth to better use. He bit his lip at the thought, going over to his jacket.  A""All right,"" Sherlock said, ""I'll tell you."" He swallowed. ""I'm doing an experiment on . . . myself. I'm checking to see my reactions to commands."" It wasn't entirely true, but he moved to check his pulse, which meant it wasn't entirely a lie either. He was surprised to see that it was a bit faster than usual. Intriguing. ""There, fine, you got your way. Are you happy now?"" AJohn paused and walked over to the table again, crossing his arms. ""It seemed like you were trying to lead me in a certain direction with the commands -- what exactly were you trying to make me tell you to do?"" A""I wasn't trying to be specific, I guess. I was just trying to get you to use commands. 'Sure, I'll have breakfast if you're making it and I'll come help in a minute' -- it's not quite a command, is it?"" He looked up at John's face. It really was quite handsome, he thought to himself. ""Why? Do you want me to rub your back?""A""No. I want you to tell me what you want."" John remained standing so he could have a little bit of height over Sherlock. A""Well, I need you to give me commands. Not suggestions, specific commands,"" he said, swallowing again. It was strange: John was asking Sherlock what he wanted yet Sherlock felt this whole thing had got somehow out of his own control. And he wasn't doing anything to stop it. ""For the experiment, I mean. I'll let you know when I have enough data. What ever command you want. Anything. But don't pick clean the flat,"" he looked down at the table and fiddled with something, ""that would be less fun.""AJohn smirked. ""Oh. Yes, I suppose cleaning the flat would be less fun than . . . what? Something like . . . telling you to get on your knees?"" He pointed to the floor in front of him. ""Now, Sherlock.""ASherlock didn't need to check his pulse -- the fact that he immediately dropped down onto his knees told him everything he needed to know about his reaction. The fact that he didn't know what was coming next was also quite intriguing.",,7352
" John's Browsing History, Sherlock Loses Control Of An Experiment, BDSM, Submissive, Dominant, PWP, We're Serious About The PWP Tag, Explicit Sexual Content, Restraint, Spanking, blindfold", No Archive Warnings Apply,thelookyouredoingthelookagain,5,M/M,3/3," Sherlock Holmes, John Watson",7,2014-09-27,Sherlock (TV),1990,66,        English,,2014-09-27, Explicit, Sherlock Holmes/John Watson,An undeleted browsing history piques Sherlock's curiosity. He decides to investigate,"Heat spiked through John as he watched Sherlock. This wasn't the role he usually imagined himself in, but he was finding it quite easy to adapt to. He stepped closer to Sherlock, put two fingers under his chin and lifted his head. ""Tell me what made you do this today.""""The videos you watched last night,"" Sherlock said. He felt heat in his cheeks, but he wasn't quite sure it was embarrassment.""How many times, Sherlock, have I asked you not to touch my things?"" John asked slowly.""It was an accident,"" Sherlock said. ""You should have deleted your history if you wanted to keep it a secret.""John laced his fingers into Sherlock's hair and tugged his head back. ""You accidentally opened the computer, looked up my history, and clicked on the websites?"" He bent down a little bit. ""As it's mine I can do whatever I want, Sherlock. You, however, I think you need to learn not to touch things you're not supposed to."" John let go of his hair and stepped back. ""Stand up and go to my room. Take everything but your pants off and wait for me. Don't touch yourself.""Sherlock's head was spinning a bit, but his body picked himself up and carried himself into John's bedroom. Maybe he shouldn't have mentioned the videos, this had clearly taken a sexual turn and he wasn't sure . . . yet why was he taking off his clothes? He stripped to his pants and slid into the bed. All of a sudden he did feel like touching himself, but he didn't because John had said not to. Is that why he wanted to in the first place? This was confusing, but in a way that made him want to find out more.John followed and watched him taking his clothes off, making sure he really didn't touch. What an odd turn the morning had taken. He wondered if this is what Sherlock had intended this morning or if things had simply gotten out of control. He walked into the room and shut the door. ""I don't remember telling you to lay down, Sherlock.""""Sorry,"" Sherlock said and found himself getting out of bed and standing up in front of John. He wasn't sure what to do. He wasn't sure about anything. He normally hated this feeling. He could so easily just leave the room, he could get dressed again and go back to normal. But he didn't do any of those things. He waited for John to speak.""I want you to know that, if you feel uncomfortable at any time, you're allowed to tell me to stop. No matter what I have ordered you to do. Understand?"" John asked, moving closer to him. He really was very handsome. His eyes wandered, admiring him for a moment before looking at Sherlock's face again to make sure he understood. ""All right,"" Sherlock said. He knew he trusted John. He hadn't thought they'd ever be in this position, but the trust was still there.John nodded. ""Now. Take my clothes off -- everything except my pants. And remember, you're not allowed to touch anything else but the clothes you're taking off."" Sherlock stepped forward and pulled John's jumper over his head and dropped it onto the floor. He unbuttoned his shirt and pulled that off as well. He looked at John's face and paused for a moment. Holding his gaze, he moved his hands down to John's waistband and undid the button on his trousers. His fingers touched John's skin as he did and there was an electricity. He pushed John's trousers down and waited for John to lift his feet to step out of them. Then he dropped his hands and stepped back.""You touched me,"" John said. It was harder to keep his voice steady and he wished Sherlock had done something else because this no touching was going to drive him insane. ""Am I going to have to tie you up, Sherlock?""""It was an accident,"" Sherlock said. He didn't say anything about the question.""I told you not to. Either you're not careful, or you don't know how to listen. Which one?""""I know how to listen,"" Sherlock said. ""Sorry."" He had an urge to touch John now. But he didn't.""So you're just not very careful,"" John said. ""That won't do, Sherlock. That won't do because I want to touch you. And I want to touch myself and I can't have you getting careless. Lay down.""Sherlock lay down on the bed. ""I'll be careful,"" he said quietly, watching John. He really didn't know what John was going to do, but John seemed to know and Sherlock found that quite thrilling.John went to his closet and pulled out a soft, silk tie. ""Arms up."" When Sherlock did that John tied his wrists together and then to the headboard. John smiled and put his fingertips lightly on Sherlock's chest, slowly dragging them downwards. After John tied his wrists, Sherlock shifted slightly. He was pretty sure he could get out if he absolutely wanted to. But he didn't want to. At least not yet. He was too distracted by John's fingers down his front. ""John,"" he exhaled softly.""Shh,"" John murmured, dragging his fingers so slowly that he was only just getting to Sherlock's belly now. Sherlock shifted a little in response to John's touch. He didn't want to be quiet. He wanted to make noises. He wanted John to give him a command and he wanted to follow that command. He wanted, wanted, wanted. But he stayed quiet. Because that's what John had said to do.""How much can you move your head tied up like that?"" he asked, his fingers playing with the elastic of Sherlock's pants. Sherlock didn't say anything but lifted his head from the pillow and turned it side to side. He tried not to think of John's fingers.John considered the movement. John pulled his fingers away from Sherlock and carefully climbed over him, straddling his chest. ""I want you to get me out of my pants,"" he said. Sherlock looked up at John and then considered his options. He lifted his head and pressed his mouth against the waistband of John's pants. Then he twisted his tongue to get the material between his teeth. He lowered his head as John raised his body a little and Sherlock pulled back. One side of his pants were now resting on John's hip. He did the same to the other side. He wasn't sure he could get them down any further, but he leaned forward and pressed his mouth against the material that John's cock rested behind. He parted his lips a little and exhaled a warm breath and then closed so that material went into his mouth. John lifted again and Sherlock pulled on the material, exposing John's cock. He had never really seen it -- he'd walked in on John in the shower or changing his clothes, but he'd never really see his cock and certainly not so closely and not as it was getting hard. He didn't think he could do much more with John's pants, but he didn't say anything. He dropped his head back on the pillow.""Such a good boy,"" John murmured. He shifted and took them off the rest of the way, settling back on his chest. He wrapped his fingers around his cock and stroked slowly. ""I want you to keep your mouth closed."" He put the tip against Sherlock's closed lips and stroked himself again. It was ridiculous but Sherlock felt strangely pleased when John called him a good boy. He watched John touching himself and could feel his own cock aching to be touched. He kept his mouth closed, as John said, but it was becoming harder to do as John pressed against him. He wanted to open it, take John inside, but he did his best not to.""It's nice when you're allowed to touch,"" he murmured. ""If you can keep your mouth closed for three minutes, I will reward you."" As he stroked himself, his tip pressed to Sherlock's mouth, he reached back and palmed at Sherlock's cock through his pants. Sherlock wanted to let out a moan at John's touch, but he was afraid to open his mouth. He wasn't sure what the reward would be, but god, he wanted it. He closed his eyes for a minute and inhaled through his nose and then opened his eyes and watched John's hand on his cock so close to his face.John palmed harder, his own cock pressing harder against Sherlock's lips.Surely, the three minutes were up now -- it felt like it had to have been much longer. Sherlock waited as long as he could and then slipped the tip of his tongue between his lips, just to touch John, to just taste him.John stopped everything very suddenly. His hand came off of Sherlock's cock, he stopped stroking himself and pulled from his mouth, and he even swung his leg up and got off of him. ""You know you still had a whole minute left, yeah?"" John said, sounding a bit disappointed. ""Turn onto your stomach and get your arse up a bit for me."" He made sure Sherlock twisted the tie instead of his wrists. He rubbed his arse lightly. ""I'm afraid you have to be punished, Sherlock.""Sherlock pulled his head back as John moved. He watched him and wondered, and then followed John's orders. He turned himself over, feeling a bit awkward and exposed. Was John going to hit him? He was sure that whatever he was going to do, it would be okay. He didn't know why he knew this, but he did. He waited, listening for John's next move.""I want you to count, Sherlock. If you forget a number or lose your place we'll have to start over, understand?"" John lifted his hand and brought it down hard on Sherlock's arse. Sherlock was surprised at John's slap, but he tried to remember what was happening. That he had started it. Kind of. ""One,"" he said as clearly as he could. He turned his head a bit on the pillow, so it was easier to breathe.John watched him closely for any signs of distress. He rubbed the spot before bringing his hand down on him again. ""Two,"" Sherlock said clearly. It did hurt, but there was something else there as well -- a kind of curiosity. Sherlock wanted to know what John would do; but more than that, Sherlock just wanted, even if he wasn't sure what any of this meant.John did this three more times. He brought his hand down the fifth time, waiting until Sherlock counted it before rubbing the spot. ""Turn around again. Carefully,"" he added, knowing he would be a bit sore. Sherlock shifted, trying to be as careful as he could. He was thinking of every detail now, trying to do precisely what John said. He settled back against the bed, the material rubbing his sore skin. He tried not to make a sound as he winced just a little. He looked up at John.John leaned over him and kissed his lips softly. ""You did very well,"" he praised. ""I'm going to reward you now, okay?"" He moved down and pulled Sherlock's pants off, wrapping his fingers around his cock and stroking softly.Sherlock lifted into John's kiss and was disappointed when it ended. But then John was touching him, stroking his hard cock, and it felt so good. He tried to reach to touch John, but he remembered his wrists were tied. He squirmed just a bit at John's touch. ""John,"" he said softly, ""please . . .""""No, love, you don't get to touch this time. You have to learn your lesson, don't you?"" he asked, stroking Sherlock a bit faster. Sherlock's breath was changing. It'd been a long time since anyone had touched him, and he worried he was going to come too soon and all of this would be over. He closed his eyes for a moment and a small moan escaped his lips. He opened his eyes a little to see if that was okay.""You can make noise,"" John said. ""But you cannot come, understand? Not until I tell you to."" He climbed onto the bed again, still stroking Sherlock. He leaned down and started to suck his cock, bobbing up and down as he stroked the base. ""God, John,"" Sherlock said. He closed his eyes again and focused on the feeling of John's mouth -- warm and wet. His hands moved again, pulling a little. He lifted his hips, groaning.John moved a bit faster, moving his hand so he could bob down lower and take Sherlock deeper into his mouth. Sherlock pulled on his hands again. ""John, I can't . . . I'm trying to be careful,"" he said the word slowly so John would know that he was close to coming, that if he did, it wouldn't be his fault. ""Please . . . let me.""John pulled off slowly and shook his head. ""Not yet, Sherlock. We have more games to play."" He crawled up Sherlock's body, straddling him again. ""Take some deep breaths, because I'm going to ride you and you cannot come inside me,"" he said. He fished out some lube from his drawer and spread it on his fingers. He reached back and started to open himself up. Sherlock couldn't say any words -- it was like everything John had said was all garbled and only a few words were clear. He watched John and thought he might come just from the sight. He closed his eyes and tried to breathe deeply. He could feel his cock leaking already as John's hand brushed against it. He kept his eyes closed.John pushed his fingers into his body, opening himself up. He was panting softly, admiring Sherlock's face, then turned and rolled a condom onto Sherlock. John gripped him, lined him up, and sank down with a groan. Sherlock's upper body lifted off the bed, pulling on his arms. ""John, fuck, John,"" he moaned. John was so tight around him, it felt incredible. ""Let me touch you, I want . . ."" he said, wriggling his wrists. He watched John moving, watched the pleasure on John's face. ""Let me touch you,"" he begged softly.John shook his head. ""You have to learn,"" he murmured, moving up and down. ""You feel so good, Sherlock. So good inside,"" he moaned. ""I'm . . .,"" Sherlock moaned, closing his eyes again. The feeling of John's movements, of himself sliding into John, god, it was almost too much. In fact, for a moment, he thought about twisting himself, telling John to stop -- it was all filling Sherlock's head and overloading it. He took a few breaths, inhaling sharply each time John moved down against him. He tried to clear his head. He opened his eyes, watching John . . . watching John use Sherlock to fuck himself. He had to close his eyes again. ""Why . . . why are you doing this to me?"" he moaned, turning his head to the side as he pulled on his hands again.""Because you're a bad boy, Sherlock, and you touch things you're not supposed to,"" John said. He moved faster over him, stroking his own cock lightly. But he was close and he knew Sherlock must be even more so. He slowly pulled off, moving to get a box out from under his bed. Making sure that Sherlock could see him, he pulled out a vibrator, poured some lube on it and carefully pushed it into himself. ""Now it's your turn,"" he smiled, crawling up on the bed between Sherlock's legs. He lubed his hand and rubbed between his legs. ""Legs up and open, Sherlock."" Sherlock felt . . . not afraid really but just so unsure, so out of control. He watched every one of John's moves -- he watched as he pulled out a toy and used it on himself. And then he was moving towards Sherlock and Sherlock pulled up his legs as John had commanded. He wasn't sure what John was going to do. His cock ached, he just wanted to come -- his body as confused as his head. He watched John's face and asked softly, ""What are you going to do to me?""""I'm going to fuck you, Sherlock,"" he murmured. ""And when I come, you can come. Do you understand?"" John massaged his entrance, pressing the muscle lightly. Sherlock squirmed a bit from John's touch. ""Are you going to hurt me?"" he said softly, closing his eyes again.""No,"" John said, stopping and crawling up his body. ""Hey,"" he murmured softly. ""I'm going to take care of you, love. I promise I won't hurt you and you can stop me at any time -- any time.""""I don't want you to stop,"" Sherlock said softly, still keeping his eyes shut. ""Just tell me what to do."" John kissed his mouth softly and stroked his hair. ""Hey, look at me,"" John said. When Sherlock opened his eyes he smiled softly, holding his gaze. ""I am going to take care of you. You just have to wait a little bit longer,"" he said. He pecked his lips again before sitting up again. He added a bit more lube before pushing his finger slowly into Sherlock. ""God,"" Sherlock called out. ""God, John,"" he moaned. He pulled on his wrists as he twisted his whole body in response to John's finger. ""What do you want me to do?""""I want you to be still. Can you lay still for me so I can open you up?"" John asked, slowly pumping his finger.""I don't know, I'll try,"" Sherlock said, doing his best to keep still. But he couldn't. He flinched a bit at John's movement before realising it felt so good and he wanted more. He pressed down against his fingers. ""Sorry,"" he said, but he wasn't -- it felt too good.""You like it, don't you?"" John smiled. ""You used my computer on purpose, didn't you?"" John poured a bit more lube and gently added a second finger. ""I like it, John,"" Sherlock moaned, bearing down against John's invasion. He pulled on his wrists. ""Please,"" he begged even though we wasn't even sure what he was begging for.John spread his fingers and opened him up, scooting closer and putting a condom and more lube on his cock. He pulled his fingers out and lined up, slowly pushing into Sherlock. He was so hot and tight, John swore as he pushed in slowly. He rubbed Sherlock's hip and lower stomach until he was fully seated.""John,"" Sherlock called out, his breath almost taken away. ""Please,"" he said again, rocking his hips a little. He opened his eyes to look at John. ""Please,"" he said again.""Such a good boy,"" John moaned softly. He reached back and turned the vibrator on, groaning as he started moving slowly into Sherlock. He was so close now that he knew he wasn't going to last very long. He went slowly for a bit, making sure Sherlock was okay. Slowly he started to speed up, pumping into Sherlock. ""M'close . . .oh God, Sherlock . . . "" he moaned, pushing hard into Sherlock and coming. He threw his head back, calling out for Sherlock as he shuddered and arched. When it was finally over he pulled out slowly, pulled the vibrator out, and started to stroke Sherlock quickly. He put his fingers back into Sherlock and stroked his prostate. ""Now you can come, Sherlock. Come for me."" Sherlock let his body take each of John's thrusts and felt him deep inside when John came. Sherlock's own head went back, and he opened his mouth to let out a low groan. And then John's hand was on him and then in him, and Sherlock's head went dizzy. And John was telling him to come and he let go of everything and came, his body jerking up off the bed against John's movement. ""Fuck, John,"" he called out, every muscle in his body tightening before releasing and he dropped back against the mattress.John slowed down and pulled away from Sherlock. He moved the things off of the bed and came up to Sherlock's hands. He untied them and brought them down slowly, gently rubbing his wrists and murmuring praises as he watched Sherlock catching his breath. ",,7352

Sherlock asked.A""I would like to,"" he said.A""Do you think it's because I usually boss you? Is that why you like this, telling me what I can and cannot do?""AJohn smiled softly. ""Maybe. I like all of it -- the idea that you trust someone so much to let them restrain you is sexy.""A""And you? Do you want to be restrained?"" Sherlock asked, thinking of the videos. ""Or just me?""A""I would like being restrained as well. I trust you,"" he smiled. ""Do you think you would like the other side of it?""A""Perhaps too much,"" Sherlock said, ""I'm bossy by nature as you know."" He stroked John's arm softly as he thought about the things they could do. He hadn't really watched the videos, but somehow he already had some ideas. ""Are there certain things you'd want me to do?""AJohn shrugged. ""I don't know -- a lot of the things I see look sexy. We could experiment,"" he smiled. ASherlock moved his hands to John's chest and pinched one of his nipples. He moved himself a little and sucked on it. ""Is this one of the things you like?""AJohn closed his eyes with a small moan. ""That's nice, yes,"" he murmured. A""I could try other things,"" Sherlock said, shifting his weight a little. ""I could try and you could tell me if it's something you like."" He moved over and sucked on John's other nipple as he dropped his hand just to hold John's cock. A""I'm sure if . . . if you're touching me I'll like it,"" John murmured, moving his hips against Sherlock's hand. Slowly he was getting hard again. A""And what about your box of surprises under the bed? Should I consider including those?"" Sherlock said, moving so he was lying more on top of John.A""If you want to,"" John said, flushing lightly. ""That was a secret before now,"" he smiled. A""And spanking?"" Sherlock said, lifting John's arms above his head and he continued to kiss and suck across his chest.AJohn nodded. ""Yes. But I'll be a good boy, unlike some people,"" he teased. ASherlock reached over for the tie and tied one of John's wrists to the headboard. ""Just keep the other one of there for now,"" he said. ""I'll trust you."" He moved down John's body and went back to kissing and sucking his nipples.AJohn brought his other hand up as well so he wouldn't be tempted. ""Sherlock, that feels really good,"" he sighed. ASherlock slid down John's body and stepped off the bed to look at the box. ""John Watson,"" he said, looking at the different toys. ""Hmmm . . ."" he said as he moved the box up onto the bed and then crawled over John again. He started to stroke John's cock slowly. ""Do you want something inside of you?"" he asked.A""You,"" John grinned, pushing up into his hand. A""Now you seem impatient,"" Sherlock said. ""You've given up your control now. Remember?"" Sherlock straddled him as he ran his hands up and down John's body. A""Oh. I thought we were just playing,"" he murmured, arching up into Sherlock's hands. A""Do you want me to stop and untie you?"" Sherlock said, slowing his hand a bit. ""Tell me and I will.""A""No,"" he shook his head. ""I like playing,"" he smiled. A""Good,"" Sherlock said. ""Tell me if you change your mind, but otherwise, I think it's probably wisest if you just do as I say."" He stood up and got another tie out of the wardrobe. This one he wrapped around John's head to cover his eyes. ""This okay?""A""I suppose so,"" he said. ""But how will I see you being sexy?"" he smiled. The blindfold added an extra thrill he hadn't thought much about before.A""I don't need you to see me,"" Sherlock said. ""That's not part of this game. In this game, I'm going to do something and you tell me if you like it. But part of the game is not knowing."" He shifted down towards the bottom of the bed. He picked up the lube and poured some into his hands. He started to stroke John slowly, all the way up and down, occasionally moving his thumb over the tip. ""Do you like this?"" he asked.A""Yes,"" John nodded, rolling his hips into Sherlock's hand as he stroked. ASherlock sped up his hand, concentrating more on the end of John's cock. He gripped a little tighter. ""And how about this? Do you like this better?""AJohn nodded and arched up higher. ""That's better . . . more friction,"" he murmured. A""That information is quite useful,"" Sherlock said. He stopped moving his hand and leaned over John. He went to work on his ear, using his tongue to lick around it and then sucking in the lobe before putting it between his teeth and biting a little as he pulled his head back. He sat up again. ""And that?""AJohn gasped softly and shivered at the contact. ""Yes . . . that felt good,"" he murmured. He shifted, trying to find Sherlock again. ASherlock moved back a bit. ""Pull your legs up,"" he said, bending John's legs so his feet were flat on the bed. Sherlock nestled in between them, lying down on John, sneaking a hand between their bodies to hold both their cocks. He started rocking his body. It felt good, and he leaned down and kissed John's mouth. Sherlock thought how easily he could get lost in this, so he pushed himself back up and sat back on the bed again. ""Did that feel good?"" he said, quietly pouring more lube into his hand.AJohn whined when Sherlock stopped that as well, bucking his hips for more. ""Yes . . . Sherlock, please,"" he sighed. A""That's not really a proper sentence, John,"" Sherlock said, as he picked a new toy from the box, slicked it and pressed the tip into John. The toy was thin and curved just a little. ""This is the blue one,"" Sherlock said, pressing it further in. He turned it so the curve would hit John's prostate as he started to slowly pump it. ""Do you like the blue one?""A""Ah . . .yes,"" John nodded, rolling his hips against the toy. ""Yes."" His free hand came down and gripped the bedsheet. A""Put your hand back up, John,"" Sherlock said, ""follow the rules."" He kept pumping the toy, but he slid his other hand to his own cock and stroked it. ""Would you like it if I just continued to fuck with you with this? Maybe even a little harder, would you like that?"" he asked. ""Answer with a proper sentence, please.""AJohn brought his hand up and gripped the headboard. He took a deep breath and nodded. ""I would like you t-to fuck me,"" he answered slowly. A""I'm thinking about it, but I'm looking into the box again, John, and I'm wondering something,"" Sherlock said, still moving the toy in and out of John. ""I'm looking at the black one. I'm thinking that one serves a purpose, doesn't it, John? Tell me what its purpose is.""A""It's a plug -- just keeps you open for whenever you're ready,"" he murmured. The sentence was choppy again as he was trying to speak through the constant moving of the toy. A""I wonder what it feels like,"" Sherlock said, turning himself around on John so he was straddling him but facing his cock. ""Give me your hand, John,"" he said. He slicked the plug and then put it in John's hand. He reached back for John's hand, lining it up to himself. He bent over and went back to work on John with the blue one. ""Push it in, John,"" he said, ""show me what it feels like.""A""I need to see,"" he said, pushing it forward. He did it slowly so that the rounded end would open Sherlock up slowly instead of just pushing through. He was still relaxed from before so it wasn't too difficult. ""Sherlock please . . . please let me see . . .""A""Shh, John,"" Sherlock said. ""You didn't let me touch -- I don't let you see."" He felt him stretching around the plug. When it was is in, he said, ""Thank you for your help, John,"" and turned himself back around. Fuck, it felt good, so full. He pushed the blue one into John, letting the curve press against his sweet spot, as he started to stroke him again, fast like before. He shifted his hips a little with the movement, keeping his focus on the pressure inside him.AJohn whined softly again. ""Next time you're tied up I'm going to try every single one on you,"" he moaned, heat flooding through him just thinking about it. ""I'm-I'm close . . ."" ASherlock slid the toy quickly from John. ""No,"" he said, ""don't. I'll be very disappointed, John. We've got a ways to go this time, so relax yourself."" He rubbed his hand slowly up across John's belly. He waited for a few minutes as John calmed.A""Turn on your left side now, John,"" he said softly, ""both hands stay up."" Sherlock stood up -- the plug shifted a little and the pressure intensified -- and pulled John by the legs around so John was facing the headboard. He rolled on a condom, lifted one of John's legs and leaned over. He pressed his cock into John and then pulled his legs open even further and pulled John towards him. The pressure inside him made it all feel more urgent -- he started fucking John hard and fast.A""Ah . . . fucking hell,"" John called out, his whole body rocking with the movement. ""Not helping to calm me,"" he tried to warn him. He rutted his hips forward but on his side he couldn't get any friction. ""Fuck . . . Sherlock please . . . "" A""Just a minute, John, hold on, I just need this for another minute, please,"" Sherlock said, letting his hips go hard, slamming into John. ""Hold on."" Sherlock squeezed shut his eyes. The pressure of John around his cock, the pressure of the plug inside him -- he opened his eyes and looked at John, his arm restrained, his eyes blindfolded, and the sight pushed Sherlock right to the edge and then . . . he froze, took a deep breath and pulled out. He reached over and untied the knot and freed John's hand, pulling the blindfold from his face. He leaned down and kissed his hard. ""I'm ready for you. You're going to fuck me now, John, hard. Harder than you think you should, that's what you're going to do,"" he said as he rolled onto his belly and lifted his arse in the air. ""Hurry, John,"" he said.AJohn squeezed his eyes shut and let the sounds fall from his mouth with every hard thrust into his body. He felt Sherlock's hands gripping him harder, heard his breathing quicken and he prepared for his climax, but just as suddenly Sherlock was stopping and untying him. For a wild moment he thought that was going to be the end, but Sherlock was full of surprises. He was so desperate for friction that Sherlock didn't have to tell him twice. He slid on another condom, pulled the plug from Sherlock, marveling at the sight of it, and then replaced it with his cock, slamming into Sherlock and gripping his hips hard. A""Fuck, John, yes, that's it,"" Sherlock said. ""Do you like this? Tell me . . . "" Sherlock's voice was a mix of pants and grunts.A""Yes . . . fuck Sherlock . . .it-it's so good,"" John moaned, panting heavily as he pulled Sherlock's hips for more. ""God I'm going to come. . .""ASherlock lifted his hand to his cock and started stroking as fast as he could. ""Say my name, say my name when you come,"" he panted.A""Fuck, Sherlock,"" he shouted, thrusting into Sherlock and coming into him. He called Sherlock's name over and over, even when he slumped onto Sherlock's back and simply murmured it against his shoulder.ASherlock felt John's final thrust and it pushed him over the edge. He came over his hand onto the bed, calling John's name. ""Fuck,"" he said as dropped onto the mattress. ""John,"" he reached back for him. AJohn squirmed and managed to get himself beside Sherlock, breathing heavily and swallowing and licking his lips. ""Sherlock that . . . that was fantastic.""A""Put your arms around me,"" Sherlock said, still trying to catch his breath.AJohn shifted closer and pulled Sherlock to him, wrapping his arms around him. They were sticky with sweat and he felt the soiled sheet under his hip. They were definitely going to need a shower.A""I have to close my eyes now, John,"" Sherlock said. ""My body and my brain are tired, I'm sorry."" He held onto John's arms, pulling them tighter.AJohn nodded. ""I could sleep,"" he murmured. ""I feel drained.""A""Don't squeeze my wrists,"" Sherlock said drowsily. ""They're sore. Don't leave."" His words were coming out slowly.A""I'm not leaving,"" he murmured. He had closed his eyes and was already half asleep.AEverything in Sherlock's head was a blur of images and sounds and sensations, but he was too sleepy to make sense of any of it. He listened to John breath until they both fell asleep.AAnd that's what happened the day Sherlock made breakfast.",,7352

You’re wrong, of course.  It’s a draw.”AA“You’ve resume your sexual relationship as well,” the younger man added.  “The signs are all there, the positive change in John’s demeanour after your Atherapy sessionsA and the ever so slight difference in his gait.”  He turned his attention to John.  “She’s certainly more adventurous than your previous partners, John.”AAJohn pinched the bridge of his nose and looked skyward for strength.  “Please stop talking.”AA“Alright,” Joan interjected calmly.  “So you know John and I are back together,” she conceded.  “Then it shouldn’t come as a shock that we want to return to our previous living arrangements.”  She looked at her Sherlock.  “Which means…”AA“You want me to move back to Baker Street,” Sherlock stated.AA“No,” the other detective said.AASherlock turned to his brother.  “It wasn’t a request.”AA“And if it were, you would still be denied.”  Sherlock set his tea aside.  “I have systems.  Processes.”  He steepled his hands in front of his face.  “Your presence is a constant distraction.”AA“So ignore me.”AASherlock closed his eyes and sighed dramatically.  “A lifelong ambition.”AAThe elder man paused for a moment then jumped up from his seat.  He paced back and forth a few times as he watched his brother.  Joan and John exchanged looks before she asked, “Okay.  What’s going on?”AASherlock ignored Joan’s question and focused on his brother.  He walked over to the chair and stood in front of him.  “I assume that at this juncture you’ve progressed from denial to anger?”AASherlock kept his eyes closed.  “Anger?  What do I have to be angry about?”AA“In a word?  Molly.”AAJohn looked back and forth between the two men.  “What does Molly have to do with…whatever this is?”AA“I’ll explain later,” Joan assured him.AASherlock opened his eyes and regarded his brother with a look of utter annoyance.  “I don’t like you touching my things.”AA“People aren’t things, William.”AASherlock waved his hand dismissively.  “You moved my things the last time you stayed at Baker Street.”AA“I have my own processes as well,” the elder replied, gesturing towards the desk as proof.AA“Your processes interfere with mine.”AA“So your needs supersede mine now?”AA“It’s my flat.”AA“I lived there first.”AA“ALivedA.  Past tense.  You moved and it became mine.”AA“Moved?  I was in rehab.”AA“The fact remains…”AA“The fact remains,” the elder man cut in.  “That the flat became vacant when you faked your death, as such, all rights revert back to me.”AA“And then you moved out again,” his brother reminded him.  “The flat is mine.  No take backs,” he said with a victorious smirk playing on his lips.AA“Fine,” Sherlock conceded.  “Perhaps, Molly has room.”  He turned on his heels, but not before witnessing his brother’s smirk fade into a full on scowl.AA“Will you stop it?”  Joan demanded.  “The two of you sound like children.”AA“He started it,” the Sherlocks said in unison.AA“And I’m ending it,” Joan retorted.  “Sherlock, you need to move out,” she said to her detective before turning her attention to the other.  “And you’re going to let him move back into 221B,” she declared.  “It’s not a request.  It’s just the way it is.  John and I need to have our home to ourselves if we’re going to make our marriage work.  So if either of us means anything to either of you, then you’ll put your differences aside and let us have this one thing.”AAJohn looked to his friend.  “It’s really important to us.”AA“Well, Billy?” Sherlock prompted.  “What’ll it be?”AASherlock closed his eyes again and resumed his usual thoughtful stance.  “There will be ground rules,” he informed his brother.  “Stop touching my things.”AA“If you showed the proper care and attention, then perhaps my touch wouldn’t be necessary,” his brother countered.AASherlock’s upper lip twitched, but he schooled his features into a perfect look of indifference.  “Clyde stays here.”AA“Overruled,” the elder protested calmly.  “Clyde is an integral piece of my process.”AA“Then he stays in your room.”AA“He likes to roam.”AA“Perhaps, we should let him roam into traffic.”AA“Sherlock!” Joan and John said in unison.AA“We both know even AyouA aren’t that heartless, William,” the older brother insisted.  “As a compromise, I will only allow him to roam in communal areas when you’re out of the flat or I’m in the middle of a case.”AASherlock considered the offer.  “Accepted.”AAJoan and John took that opportunity to excuse themselves to the kitchen.  “I think this may actually work,” John said with a relieved sigh.AA“I hope so,” Joan replied.AA“One question, what was that bit about Molly?” he asked seriously.AA“Sherlock’s been spending a lot of time with her working on cases,” Joan told him.  “It seems like your Sherlock is…well…jealous.”AA“Sherlock jealous because of Molly?”  John cracked a smile.  “About time don’t you think?  At this rate, we’ll all be paired off.”AA“Not my Sherlock.”AA“No,” John agreed then paused

Then, he tugged on Sherlock's hand and urged him to come out of the corner. ""Come,"" Mycroft said, ""I'll teach you how to fly.""","A""When you've been fighting for it all your lifeYou've been struggling to make things rightThat's how a superhero learns to fly""A- The Script, ""Superheroes""AASherlock sat with his back against the brick wall. He nestled into the corner he had chosen for himself. On his left, their old fence with the peeling white paint rose above his five-year-old body, and the bush Daddy planted years ago stood guard in front of him. He was glad to be home after a day at school, away from the other children and Mrs. Kitchener with her narrow black eyes staring down at him. He wondered, not for the first time, why he had to go to school. Nobody liked him there, and he didn't like being there either.""You'll learn lots and lots of new things at school, Sherlock,"" Mummy had said many weeks ago, before the leaves on the trees turned orange and the sun still shone long into the evenings. Sherlock had been excited. He loved discovering new things. He wanted to explore the world, to sail off into the oceans with a ship and a sword and Redbeard at his side.""You can be a pirate when you grow up,"" Daddy had said, ""when you're big and strong and know lots of things about the world. Then you can do whatever you want. But now, you have to go to school. Maybe you'll meet a friend who will want to explore with you.""So Sherlock had held Mummy's hand and walked up to the enormous front gates, wide-eyed and imagining the open oceans and blue skies on the other side.But the insides of Cunningham Primary School didn't look like voluminous clouds or rolling waves. Instead, it was all straight lines and ink-stained desks and ""stay still, Sherlock!"" Mrs. Kitchener wasn't like Mummy. Her lips were sharp like a ruler and her eyes flat as the chalkboard and she didn't run a hand through his curls and say, ""what else?"" She was never happy with Sherlock, and he didn't understand why. ""Stop talking, Sherlock,"" she would say, or ""stop running about,"" or ""stop asking useless questions."" Sherlock looked at the world and wanted to run and jump and fly but all he heard was ""stop.""Soon, the other children stopped talking to Sherlock, as well. They said ""you're such a know-it-all!"" and whispered when he walked past. Ginny Davies had cried when he told her she was doing her sums wrong and her friends had crowded around him at break time and shoved dirt down his shirt. School was stupid and other kids were stupid and Sherlock just wanted everything to be the way it used to be, when he woke up to the smell of Mummy's bread baking in the oven and spent the days wandering through Mummy's study and watched bees skitter from one blossom to another in Daddy's flowerbeds.Now, Sherlock was curled up in his special spot in the backyard, his arms around his knees and his curls getting caught in the jagged splinters of the fence and the messy branches poking out from the bush. He wondered if he nuzzled in far enough and made himself small enough, maybe he could sink into the soil and the leaves and never have to come out again.That was what Sherlock was thinking about when a hand suddenly pushed away the branches and a large, blotchy face took its place.""What's wrong?"" his big brother asked, reaching out to pull him out of the corner.""Nothing,"" Sherlock replied, turning his head and looking away, but he couldn't stop the one little teardrop from crawling out the corner of his eye.""I'm not stupid, Sherlock, I know something's wrong,"" Mycroft said, and it wasn't fair, because Mycroft was always clever and he was never wrong and everyone loved him for it.Sherlock turned back to look at his brother, angry and petulant and his eyes still wet. ""Nobody at school likes me!"" he said, folding his arms.Mycroft frowned for a second, before the thin lines on his forehead smoothed away. ""You don't know that,"" he said.""It's true!"" Sherlock told him. ""Reggie and the other boys were playing superheroes at break today. I wanted to be Superman but they wouldn't let me because I can't fly."" He felt another tear creeping out of his eye and reached up to scrub at it angrily. ""But Henry can't fly either, and they let him be Superman!""Mycroft was quiet for a moment. Then, he tugged on Sherlock's hand and urged him to come out of the corner. ""Come,"" Mycroft said, ""I'll teach you how to fly.""Sherlock's head snapped up, his mouth opened wide. ""Really?""""Yes, really. But it's not easy,"" Mycroft warned.Sherlock nodded. He followed Mycroft as the older boy went into the house to grab his backpack. They walked back into the yard and settled down in the grass under the large oak tree. Mycroft pulled out a textbook from the bag and a blank notepad.""Can you fold a paper aeroplane, Sherlock?""He nodded. Mycroft ripped off a page from the notepad and handed it to him. Sherlock set the piece of paper on the ground and pressed down to create folds like Daddy had shown him. When he was done, he drew his arm back and threw the aeroplane outwards. It rushed forward for a brief moment but it soon began wavering in the air, tipping from side to side before finally doing a somersault and falling onto the grass. Sherlock stared at the flimsy thing where it laid, unmoving amongst the blades of grass swaying gently in the wind.""You need to make it more symmetrical,"" Mycroft said, nudging Sherlock's shoulder. He picked the aeroplane up and stretched out the crudely-made folds. Slowly and carefully, under Sherlock's attentive gaze, he lined up the edges and pressed down evenly. When Mycroft let his aeroplane go with a quick flick of his wrist, it flew out in a graceful swoop before dropping to the ground.""Want to know how it does that?"" Mycroft asked. Sherlock nodded, eagerly. His brother pushed the textbook on the ground towards him. ""It's all in here,"" he continued, flipping through the pages until he came to a diagram with a baseball travelling in the air with arrows pointing outwards. ""And not just paper aeroplanes. Real ones too, and helicopters and rocket ships."" He pointed at a line with letters and symbols like the ones in Mummy's books. ""This will teach you how to fly.""Sherlock fell upon the book in wonder, turning the pages to see more diagrams and equations and lines and lines of words, strange words with so many letters that made Sherlock think of the long white trails planes leave across the sky. ""You'll teach me what this means?""""Of course.""Sherlock looked up at his big brother. ""You know everything, don't you, Mycroft?""""No,"" the older boy replied. He paused. ""Not yet.""""But you will one day,"" Sherlock said with conviction, feeling the words with every thump of his heart. ""Someday, you'll know everything and I'll know how to fly. We'll be superheroes!""Mycroft smiled at him, sunlight streaming through the branches of the oak tree and lighting on his glittering blue eyes. ""Yes,"" he said, ""someday. And no one will be able to stop us.""",Superheroes,1232

John called from the kitchen, pouring the scalding water into three cups. ""Sugar and cream, please,"" Molly responded, wincing as one of the twins gave a particularly hard kick. She attributed their moodiness to their relation to Sherlock. John added milk to his own cup, sugar and milk to Hamish's, added the necessary ingredients to Molly's peppermint tea (recommended by the Ob-gyn) and left Sherlock's black. He brought the drinks out on a tray that was also laden with Mrs. Hudson's honey biscuits. ""Thank you,"" Molly said, taking her cup gratefully. Her hands were still numb from the November chill that had pervaded London, but the tea and the cozy fire helped to comfort her as two lives stirred within her. She was due in just a week, and those seven days seemed both too soon and too far away. Hamish took his tea with a nod, relishing in the big boy mug that was identical to everyone else's. Sherlock took his drink without a word, his eyes glazed over but not so empty as to suggest he had fled to his Mind Palace. John had a rule about doing that when they had company; Apparently it was ""rude"". ""How are you, Molly?"" John asked conversationally, taking a seat in his chair. Hamish sat in the client's chair, Molly on the couch, and Sherlock in his chair. We really need more furniture, John thought. ""I'm well,"" Molly responded. ""Just a little nervous, I suppose."" ""Aren't we all,"" John chuckled. Molly gave him a smile that appeared more of a grimace as the pain in her stomach grew worse. Suddenly, her legs felt wet. She prayed that she hadn't just peed herself when she realized the liquid didn't smell of urine. Her water had just broken. ""Are you alright?"" John hurriedly asked, his doctor instincts kicking in as soon as he observed her wrapping an arm around her swelled abdomen and the liquid began to drip to the floor. At this, Sherlock perked up and looked quickly at Molly, deducing. ""She's having a contraction, John,"" Sherlock exclaimed, abandoning his tea on the mantle as he stood abruptly. Panic and excitement gripped at his chest.""What's a contraction?"" Hamish curiously asked, swinging his legs back and forth as if nothing was wrong. His parents ignored him in favor of looking at Molly. ""Are you sure?"" John asked, standing with an equal amount of urgency. Molly gasped as a spike of pain took hold of her and she nodded at John, wrapping her arms around her belly. ""Call the hospital, Sherlock,"" John commanded. Sherlock acquiesced immediately, whipping out his phone and quickly dialing the required numbers. As his husband dealt with that, John knelt down to face Hamish. ""'Mish, Aunt Molly is going to be having the babies really soon so I'm going to drop you off at Uncle Mike's, okay?"" John was already searching frantically for his son's shoes. Hamish set down his tea and crossed his arms stubbornly. ""I want to come!"" He exclaimed. John huffed impatiently and turned to Sherlock, who had just hung up the phone. ""He wants to come, Sherlock,"" John stated, throwing up his arms and rolling his eyes. ""So he'll come,"" Sherlock replied simply. Hamish uncrossed his arms and beamed. That never worked. ""Hamish, if you can find your shoes and put on your jacket, scarf, and hat in the next two minutes you can come,"" John offered, already stuffing his own shoes on. Hamish nodded and set about the task. ""Alright, Molly,"" Sherlock turned to her. ""Is there anything you need before we go?"" ""No,"" she breathed. She took John's offered hand and stood up, wincing as her wet maternity trousers irritated her skin. ""Maybe a pair of sweatpants?"" Sherlock nodded and practically ran back to the bedroom where he fetched a pair of his own. ""Don't look,"" Molly commanded as she stripped of her soaking trousers and underwear. The men obeyed and turned their backs, acknowledging for Hamish to do the same. Molly maneuvered into the pants with great difficulty, having to work around her massive stomach. ""Ok, let's go,"" she said, tossing her pants into the experiment waste bin. ""Are you ready, 'Mish?"" John asked, surveying his son's haphazardly tied scarf and askew hat. ""Yeah, Da!"" Hamish happily exclaimed. He led the way down the stairs, with John behind him, Molly in third place, and Sherlock taking up the rear. Sherlock shot off a quick text to Mycroft, who responded instantly saying a cab was outside. Sherlock sat in the front and the rest sat in the back. He gave the directions to St. Bart's and they sped off. ",The Twins Are Born!,5077

If anything, he was more nervous than his husband, for the children were his own and could have any number of mental issues. But Sherlock put on a brave face and endured the numbing of his fingers and the bright lights of the delivery room and the butterflies that were rearranging his organs. He endured all that so he could witness the birth of their second and third children.Molly's wailing sent chills up their spines and caused sympathy to burn even in Sherlock's chest as she pushed and pushed. Sherlock and John waited with bated breath, growing more anxious with every ticking second. Sherlock would later describe the event as being the longest possible labor in the entirety of the known universe. John would later roll his eyes and dilute the theatrics with a reminder of ""It only took eight hours, Sherlock.""Suddenly, a baby's cries filled the room, forever searing itself into Sherlock's Mind Palace in a door he sought for comfort. His and John's eyes brimmed with tears as the first of two twins emerged, angry and screaming. Even then, the hair atop its head was an unkempt mess of raven curls. ""It's a girl!"" The nurse cried, swaddling the newborn in blankets as she rubbed some of the excess liquid off of her. Sherlock's breath caught in his throat as he gingerly took his baby girl into his arms. She was still crying, her hereditary stubbornness already making itself apparent, but those cries were the most beautiful things Sherlock had ever heard. Her eyes were a light blue tinged with gray, the spitting image of her father's. Sherlock liked to imagine that she smiled at him before he handed her over to John. Molly, while distracted by the momentary ease of pain and beauty of the baby girl, was by no means done. The pain began anew as the second baby began to crown. Sherlock took her by the hand as she battled through it, as she fought off the agony for him and John. The doctors urged her to push one last time, and she relinquished any residual strength she had in order to force the child out of her. Molly's pained screams resounded in the delivery room and prompted further tears from her baby, but she nevertheless fought through it, and soon a second warbling cry was heard. ""This one's a boy!"" Exclaimed the nurse, cradling the indignant baby in her arms. He too had a mess of black curls on his head, as well as light blue eyes. Sherlock stepped forward and held his son as John held his daughter. They were messy, crying, and apparently the tiniest bit underweight, but they were here. They were theirs. John and Sherlock reluctantly handed their children off to the nurses so they could be cleaned, weighed, and swathed in blankets to fight off the November briskness that seemed to seep into the hospital. They stumbled, flustered, into the waiting room where Hamish had fallen asleep in Mycroft's lap. The elder Holmes was typing away on his phone, but as soon as he saw his brother and his husband, he tucked the phone away in his pocket, taking care not to stir his sleeping nephew. ""How was it?"" Mycroft whispered as Sherlock and John took the seats in front of him, ""Healthy although slightly underweight boy and girl,"" Sherlock pridefully said, gripping his husband's hand even now that the hard part was over. ""Names?"" Mycroft asked, totally aware and utterly repulsed that his nephew was drooling on his pant leg. Sherlock looked to John and shrugged. ""It's your turn,"" he said. John's eyes glazed over for a second as he fell deep into thought. ""Violet and Gavin?"" He proposed.""Why would you name our son after the Detective Inspector?"" Sherlock asked. ""I mean, I know he and Mycroft are shagging but that doesn't make him family, John.""""His name is Greg,"" Mycroft said defensively, nearly waking Hamish with his raised tone. Sherlock grinned. ""Those names are lovely, then,"" he said, turning to John and pecking him on the lips. Hamish slowly began to wake, turning onto his back and leaving a small stain on Mycroft's trousers in his wake. ""Da?"" He asked, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Seeming to remember that he was in a hospital, Hamish stood up abruptly with a beaming smile on his face. ""How are they?""""They're brilliant, Hamish. A little boy and a little girl,"" Sherlock said, returning his son's kind smile. ""Can I see them?"" Hamish asked, sitting up entirely in his own seat. Mycroft tried to stretch his legs in a subtle manner. ""Not yet, I'm afriad,"" Sherlock replied. ""Not for another half hour. How about we go to the cafeteria while we wait?"" He suggested, hoping to distract Hamish before he stormed into the room anyway. ""Ok, I'm hungry,"" Hamish said, hopping off his chair. ""Will they have cake for Uncle Mike?"" Behind his nephew's back, Mycroft frowned at Sherlock as if to say ""did you really train your son to use such petty insults against me?"" Sherlock just grinned. The four of them went downstairs and shared a terrible hospital meal together. Hamish had a hot dog, John a burger, Mycroft a salad (""because I'm still dieting, Sherlock!"") and Sherlock fish and chips. The food itself was horrible, but under the influence of the euphoria brought about by Violet and Gavin's birth, they were able to enjoy it. A...............................................AHamish ran into the room and practically jumped on Molly, smothering her in hugs and kisses. She was tired but they had given her medication for the residual pain and she would be able to sleep soon, so she embraced her nephew and pressed a kiss to his head. Hamish's eyes, however, had been ensnared by his baby siblings. Violet and Gavin lay in separate carts, swathed heavily in blankets and cute little pink and blue hats. They were to be taken to the baby room soon, but Hamish wanted to meet them up close and personal rather than through the glass. Now calm, fed, and clean, the twins were relatively easy to manage. Well, for the time being, anyway. Hamish reached his hand into Violet's crib/cage and squealed in delight as her eyes met his and her little fingers wrapped around his. Her blue eyes were much lighter than his own, but they also had a certain glint to them, something Hamish had always observed in his dad. Her curls were puffy like dad's, and black as night. Hamish pressed a little kiss to her hat, inhaling that new baby smell that radiated cuteness and safety and family. Then he proceeded over to Gavin, who was kind of drifting off into sleep already. He didn't meet Hamish' eye, but he did smile just a teeny bit as his brother pressed a kiss to his cheek. Hamish felt a warmth in his chest that was reserved specifically for cases with dad and bedtime stories with papa. Sherlock and John came in behind him, each placing a hand on their son's shoulders. They looked upon the new additions to their little family with such love and adoration that the nurses were reluctant to take the babies away. They would be staying overnight with Molly, seeing as that was protocol for underweight babies. Hamish was exhausted, as were John and Sherlock, so they took a cab home. Sherlock carried the sleeping Hamish up to his room and laid him gently on the bed, taking off his shoes, hat, and gloves. He and John both kissed him goodnight before shutting off the light and stumbling downstairs. John kissed Sherlock lightly, too tired to do much else than kiss. Sherlock took of his jacket and John did the same. They fell into bed in their underwear, too tired to even mumble ""I love you.""Perhaps it was because they didn't need to. ",The Twins Are Born!,5077

Sherlock murmured, absentmindedly stroking his husband's sandy hair. It was days like these, where they had just come off of the high of solving a case and settled back into their (ab)normal domestic lives for a little while, that Sherlock loved the most. Hamish was at school, the twins were asleep (which was a miracle in and of itself), and he and John were just enjoying the solitude of their bedroom. It was opportunities like these that they automatically jumped on top of each other and fucked as loudly as they dared, but today was... different. There wasn't that same urgency to get it done before Hamish came home or one of the twins woke. It was just peaceful and serene, like a dull wave of sluggishness and content had washed over them and erased all the stress that accumulated in their faced-paced days. ""Hm?"" John hummed, stirred from his stupor by the velvety voice of his husband. He turned to look at Sherlock, once again falling into a daze as he fell deep into the rich sapphire irises that gleamed so brightly and so animatedly. ""We're going to be needing a bigger flat soon,"" Sherlock bluntly stated. John flicked his eyes from Sherlock's simply to forgo the distractions they caused. ""But this is our home,"" John whimpered, sounding much like their petulant seven-year-old when he demanded that his experiment be allowed to run past bedtime. ""And it was well suited to our needs when it was just you and me,"" Sherlock argued, sitting up slightly. ""But now we have a seven year old and two one-year olds. We have an obligation to them, to let them grow up in a flat big enough to accommodate them.""""How will we be able to afford an entirely new flat?"" John asked, suddenly fussing over the logistics in an effort to put Sherlock off the idea. ""We have to stay in London, or else Hamish will have to switch schools and-""""I have a trust fund of several million as well as a large inheritance,"" Sherlock cut him off. ""And, if you're so worried about location, then I can phone Mycroft and he'll have something arranged.""John pouted and stuck his lower lip out, looking for all the world like a grown-up version of Hamish. ""But who will look after Mrs. Hudson?""""Mrs. Hudson.""""She's an old woman, Sherlock! People have and will continue to come after her to get to you,"" John argued, not daring to raise his voice more than its normal tone. The twins had a sleeping schedule as erratic as their father's, and therefore every single moment that they were asleep was practically a Godsend.""She is more than capable of taking care of herself,"" Sherlock countered. ""She had been doing so long before we moved in."" John's eyebrows furrowed, a sign that he took that as a valid point. Sherlock suppressed a grin. ""I'm not going to be the one to tell Hamish,"" he pouted. ""And he and I have to approve of the place before we even consider it.""""Agreed,"" Sherlock acquiesced. ""Now let's have sex.""""You're so blunt,"" John chuckled at the sudden change of topic.""You wouldn't have it any other way.""A.................................................................................................................................A""Papa! I got a hundred on my maths quiz!"" Hamish exclaimed excitedly, waving the paper around as proof. He came to John first because he had learned from a very early age that he needed more than just a high grade to impress Dad. But he liked it that way. It gave him passion and drive. ""That's amazing, 'Mish!"" John replied, ruffling his son's hair affectionately. ""You're getting smarter every day."" Hamish beamed as he took John by the hand and they crossed the street. ""Where's Da?"" Hamish asked, being extra super careful to look both ways, even though John was holding his hand. ""He's in his Mind Palace,"" John explained. Hamish nodded in understanding. The Mind Palace was something he was intimately familiar with, as Daddy had been teaching him how to construct his own. Except he wasn't supposed to tell Papa that. They walked along in silence, the brisk January air causing their breaths to come out as clouds of smoke. Hamish used to pretend that he was smoking, but that made Daddy very cross, so he stopped. ""'Mish?"" John asked, nudging his son's shoulder to shake him from his deep thought. ""Yeah, Pa?"" Hamish responded, glaring up at the sun that was doing very little to warm him up. ""What do you think about moving to a new flat?"" John ventured, knowing well enough by now that it was no good to beat around the bush with Hamish. ""Why?"" Hamish asked.""Because we need more room because of the new babies,"" John explained. Hamish's face turned dark and he sped up a little bit. ""No!"" He said petulantly, crossing his arms. John frowned, unsure of what to do. Hamish was rarely cross for no reason. ""Why not?"" ""I just don't wanna,"" Hamish said in lieu of an actual explanation. ""Hamish,"" John called, stopping his son in his tracks. He so rarely used his full name (Hamish had deduced he held the tiniest bit of animosity toward the name ""Hamish"") that Hamish was shocked to hear it out of his Pa's mouth. ""Son, you have to tell me why you don't want us to move out of the flat,"" John said, bending down on one knee so he was level with Hamish. Hamish's eyes welled up with tears. ""Everything was fine before the twins came!"" He exclaimed, throwing up his little hands in frustration. ""You, me and Daddy were fine. Now we need a bigger flat and I can't do experiments when they're sleeping and you and Daddy spend all your time with them."" Hamish paused for a moment to wipe his nose on his jacket sleeve/ ""It's not fair!""John felt a twinge of guilt in his chest. He didn't realize that they'd been neglecting Hamish. ""'Mish, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that things have changed, but Violet and Gavin are just babies and they require more of our attention."" He reached out a hand to wipe the tears from his son's cheek, but Hamish dodged his hand. ""Yeah, well, I hate them!"" He yelled. He ran up the block to the flat, leaving John stunned on the street. ",The Twins Are Born!,5077

He didn't even stop into the living room to greet his father, he was so angry. Sherlock was shaken from his stupor by the sound of a slamming door and muffled crying. Alarmed, he sat up from his chair and started up the stairs after his son, only to be stopped by the sound of the front door opening and closing. John came running up the stairs a second later, visibly angry. ""He doesn't want to move because he feels excluded by the twins,"" Sherlock deduced, eyeing John's teary eyes. John just nodded, more than happy to leave the task of placating Hamish to Sherlock. He was accustomed to having to deal with theatrics on his son's part, but none so dramatic nor as startling as these. John had no idea that Hamish felt so excluded, and the fact that he hadn't noticed made him feel like a negligent father. And a father who didn't pay attention to his kids was something he never wanted to be. ""Hamish?"" Sherlock whispered, knocking lightly on his son's door. He received no reply, but chose to enter anyway. ""Go away!"" Hamish exclaimed, his voice muffled by the pillow he was crying into. Sherlock closed the door lightly and took tentative steps toward his son, who had, in his anger, thrown his boots across the room. Sherlock sat poised on the edge of Hamish's bed, and began rubbing slow circles into his back. He felt Hamish's body tremble as he was wracked with sobs, but his son made no move to push his father off him. Sherlock, after years of observing John, kept rubbing calming patterns into Hamish's back until he felt the boy's body calm down. The tears finally subsided five minutes later and Hamish sat up, tears streaking his face. Sherlock wrapped an arm around him as Mycroft used to do to him and brought Hamish against his body, cocooning him in warmth and comfort. ""I don't hate them, Da,"" Hamish cried, his voice trembling as his tiny fists clutched at Sherlock's jacket. Sherlock paid the expensive fabric no mind as Hamish discreetly wiped his nose on his dad's shirt. ""I know you don't, 'Mish,"" Sherlock cooed, his deep voice immediately registering safety and warmth in Hamish's brain. ""You know, Hamish,"" Sherlock said. ""Uncle Mycroft did this very same thing when I was born.""Hamish looked up with a ghost of a grin on his face. ""Of course he did.""At this, Sherlock chuckled. ""Really. He was seven and I was just a few weeks old and he told me I was an idiot."" Hamish giggled slightly. ""Hamish,"" Sherlock said. ""I'm not going to pretend that I know what you're feeling, although I have a pretty good idea. You feel excluded and alone because Papa and I have been paying more attention to Violet and Gavin than you.""""Yeah,"" Hamish agreed, his voice small. ""But, 'Mish, what you need to understand is that Papa and I love you more than anything in the world. We love Violet and Gavin too, just as much. They're babies, and for a few years they're going to need our help. That doesn't mean that Papa and I love you any less, just that we cannot deviate our attention from the twins. We want them to know that they are as loved as you are."" Hamish nodded.""When they're older, they're going to look up to you like I looked up to Mycroft,"" Sherlock whispered, as though this were some big secret. Hamish giggled. ""You didn't look up to Uncle Mycroft, Dada. Stop lying.""Sherlock chuckled a bit and shook his head. ""I'm going to deny ever having said this, but when I was a kid, your uncle seemed like the smartest man in the world. I wanted nothing more than to be him. That's why he taught me deductions like I teach you. There was a time when I was like Violet and Gavin, and I was just a baby that needed to be looked after. Mycroft thought he hated me because I was so useless, but then I grew up and we were best friends. It'll be like that with you, Vi, and Gav. I promise. Just give them a little time.""Hamish nodded and wrapped his dad in a big hug. Sherlock smiled a bit as he rested his chin on Hamish's head of close-cropped blond hair. *******************************************************************""I'm sorry I yelled at you, Pa,"" Hamish sheepishly said, looking up at John with wide eyes. John picked him up (that was getting a little too hard) and pressed a sloppy kiss to Hamish's cheek. ""Ew!"" Hamish squealed, rubbing at the offensive mark with his sleeve. John and Sherlock laughed as they brought Hamish to the couch where Chinese takeout awaited them. They were just about to settle down to a family meal when Sherlock's phone began to vibrate. Sherlock stood up and drew it from his pocket, frowning at the Caller ID.""What do you want, Mycroft?"" He bitterly said. ""That was very sentimental, Sherlock,"" Mycroft teased. ""I never knew you loved me so much.""Sherlock covered the receiver of the phone with his hands. ""Hamish, cover your ears,"" he commanded. Hamish grinned as John placed his hands over his ears. He watched as his father animatedly began yelling into the phone and he caught a few of the words. They subsequently went into his Mind Palace for later use. ",The Twins Are Born!,5077

Sherlock called. ""It's time to go!"" Right on cue, their son came bounding down the stairs, a look of disgust on his face. He walked to John and Sherlock, looking up at the ceiling as he went. ""They've got asbestos they're trying to hide,"" he revealed, pointing at the ceiling. Sherlock grinned as John chuckled. ""I don't think this is the place, 'Mish,"" John said. ""How about you?"" Hamish made a face and shook his head.""I'm sorry,"" John said to the woman showing them around. ""But I think we're going to have to see a few more.""The lady, dressed sharply in a dark pants suit, gave John a very forced smile. ""Of course,"" she said, her voice dripping with annoyance. She led them out of the flat, down the stairs, and back onto the street where Sherlock hailed them a cab. The woman sat in front, clearly wishing to distance herself from the noisy family. ""I'm gonna get my own room, right, Da?"" Hamish asked. ""We've been over this, Hamish,"" Sherlock answered. ""A thousand times,"" John muttered.""You're going to have your own room,"" Sherlock finished, shooting John an affectionate glance. The comment went unheard by Hamish, who was bubbling with the excitement of having an entire room all to himself, despite the fact that he had his own room in the old flat. They drove along in an amicable silence, broken by the occasional deduction of someone on the street. Sherlock and John sat across from their son, conversing in silent glances. This would be the fifth flat just that day, making it the eleventh in total. It seemed that no place would be as good as 221B. They finally pulled up to the woman's new address, with Sherlock paying yet another cab fee. They'd have to start taking the tube again, at the rate he was spending. They hadn't been since Hamish got lost for over an hour because he decided to wander off and investigate a discarded scarf. ""4 bedroom, 2 bathroom, wood burning fireplace. Decently priced, all things considered,"" the real estate woman read from her notebook in a monotone voice. ""Why don't you go check out the upstairs, 'Mish?"" John asked, urging his son toward the stairs with a slight push. Hamish nodded eagerly and bounded up the stairs, leaving John and Sherlock alone to check out the first floor. The living room was the first room to be entered, just as in 221B. It was completely unfurnished, almost entirely bare with the exception of the fireplace. The floors were polished, sleek hardwood, light browny-yellow in color. The wall on the right of the doorway held two large windows that allowed a generous amount of light into the room. It was bigger than the living room in the old flat, but by very slim margins. It was, however, open and airy and John was immediately drawn to it. They wandered into the adjacent dining room, which was separated from the sitting room by an archway rather than a door. I'm going to have doors put in there. Not going to be hearing Sherlock doing his experiments while I'm reading the paper. The kitchen was furnished with just black marble countertops, but was nevertheless spacious. John and Sherlock felt an attraction to the flat already. From there they went upstairs, which was just a single corridor with three doors on each side and another door all the way at the end of the hall. The first door led to the master bedroom, which was much larger than Sherlock's bedroom back in the old flat. Two large windows illuminated the room with sunlight. There was a door inside the bedroom that led to the en-suite bathroom, complete already with a bathtub, two sinks, and a shower. In the next bedroom they met Hamish, who had fallen into his own Mind Palace. Sherlock and John knew better than to disturb him when he was finally silent and calm, so they left that room. The next two bedrooms were smaller but nevertheless spacious. The bathroom was the same. At the very end of the hall there was a linens closet, which was completely bare. John and Sherlock had a hushed conversation in one of the bedrooms.""What d'you think?"" John asked, a small grin on his face. Sherlock's eyes said it all. ""I like it,"" he said. ""Me too,"" John replied. ""Shall we?"" Sherlock asked. ""Let's ask Hamish first, but I think we should get it either way."" Sherlock nodded and they returned to Hamish's room, where the boy was still lost in thought. ""Hamish,"" Sherlock called. Everyone with a Mind Palace has a way to come out of it, a certain sound that can pull them out of their stupor. For Sherlock, it was John's voice. For Hamish, it was his Dad's deep cadence. Hamish shook himself slightly and looked up at his parents, a wide grin spreading on his face. ""What were you thinking about, squirt?"" John asked, reaching a hand down to ruffle his son's hair. ""Where I'm gonna put my bed in relation to the windows and my dresser and where I'm gonna put my toys-"" Hamish excitedly chattered. ""Whoa, whoa,"" John cut Hamish off. ""So, you want to live here?""""Well, duh, Papa,"" Hamish said, forever astounded by his Papa's ability to be so smart and at the same time, so very thick. ""Let's go buy it, then,"" Sherlock decided. He took Hamish by the hand and allowed his son to lead him down the stairs one at a time. John followed not far behind, a warm sense of contentment in his heart.   ",The Twins Are Born!,5077

When Khan is awakened, instead of becoming Marcus' pawn, he manages to take over the ship and maroons the Starfleet crew on a nearby planet - except for one, intriguing little doctor.","AIt was a mistake, she reasoned to herself as she watched the planet growing smaller and smaller the further away they traveled from it, to awaken one of those seventy-three people in their cryotubes. She was the Chief Medical Officer so of course she would be kept onboard the ship, likely to awaken the rest of the people in their tubes, although she did not have any concrete evidence to support it. It was the most logical answer. “Go back, and get them. There is no reason for them to be left on that planet. We will not harm you,” she explained stubbornly, her arms crossed over her chest as she turned from the screen to face the man in the chair.ANormally, when one was her superior, she would address them as such. But she knew not who this man was, nor his intentions, and although she was now the highest-ranking official onboard, she would not bow to the intense presence that he presented.A“I have no use for them, Lieutenant Commander Hooper. You are the only one I need,” he explained, his cold eyes focused on her. As he surveyed her, she couldn’t help but feel exposed, as if he was stripping her with his eyes while attempting to discover her secrets. “Tell me doctor, are you frightened?”AMolly started as he addressed her. Was it possible for someone to hypnotize another just by their voice? “No,” she said automatically. Was she though? She watched as the man, Khan, as he had introduced himself upon awakening, squinted at her slightly before standing up. In two long strides he was before her, her head tilted back so she could continue to look at him. His eyes, a mix of blue and green lacked warmth she was accustomed to. But beneath the cold, hard exterior she could practically see the gears turning, could see him a bit lost and confused about the new world, or lack thereof, he had awoken to.AHis hand reached out and curled around her wrist, his fingertips pressing against her pulse. A smirk at the erratic rhythm she knew he felt beneath her skin tugged at his sculpted lips. She jerked her arm attempting to pull it from his grip, but his hand tightened around her wrist. “Molly,” he said, his deep voice caressing her name like a silk sheet on a bed, “are you afraid?”AMolly stared up at him, her eyes wide as she considered his words again. “No,” she replied, her voice small. He loosened his grip on her wrist but she didn’t struggle, she didn’t turn on her heel and run. Something told her he would be able to grab her before she even made it to the turbolift. He stepped forward, forcing her to take a step back, until her back collided with the helm.AHis hand reached out and caressed the side of her face with a gentleness she had not expected out of him. His eyes, still cold with a sadness and anger she couldn’t fathom, were curious as he gauged her reaction to his touch. Her lips parted slightly, her breath hot against his arm. Khan inhaled deeply; allowing her sweet scent to permeate his senses, envelop him in her arousal. He could sense it in her, though suppressed, and he would make it worth her while. The air crackled between them, before she rose up on tiptoe slightly and tentatively brushed her lips against his, why she did so was not at the forefront of her mind. He exhaled sharply out his nose as his hand slid further along her face and buried his fingers in her hair, pulling her closer and deepening the kiss. He wrapped his other arm around her waist and lifted her until she was sitting on the helm. He stepped between her legs and moved his lips harder against hers, his tongue tracing along her bottom lip, begging for entrance.AHer lips parted with a gasp, allowing his tongue in. Her legs were wrapped loosely around his thighs, her feet clad in her boots, resting just below his ass.  Her skin felt like a flame was being held to it as his fingers traced along the hem of her blue Starfleet issue uniform, sliding it slowly up her thighs. Her legs tightened around him, drawing him closer while sliding herself closer to him on the helm. He threw down a hand to brace himself, a cheeky grin on his face at her eagerness, as he felt her fingers deftly undoing the zippers, buttons, and snaps of his clothing. He had already scanned the helm properly upon taking the bridge and had memorized every functions location. He swiftly turned off the suppressant supply that was sent ship wide through the ventilation system.AIt wasn’t every day a long dormant Alpha came into contact with a ship of his kind, however far removed. His hand moved from the helm and around her waist, bunching up the fabric of her dress and swiftly tugging it out from under her. She giggled, and he felt it through his very being. Oh how he would love to make her giggle like that for him more often. He hissed slightly as he felt a rush of cool air against his skin as his trousers were shoved to his ankles. He wasn’t a modest person as she quickly found out, taking his thick cock in hand and stroked it. He groaned, his knees buckling slightly before his own conceited resolve kicked it and took over. He grabbed her waist and pulled her flush against him, her squeak of surprise only furthering his motivations.AHe gently pushed her back until she was lying on the helm; her dress rucked up well above her waist. He pushed his fingers through the fabric of her underwear and tore it from her. “You know what you are, yes?” he asked, his voice deep as he placed slow, languorous kisses to her stomach and thighs. Her stomach shook with her shaky breath.A“Yes, but how did you…” she began to ask before her eyes grew wide. “You didn’t…” she breathed, feeling a sensation she hadn’t felt since she was in her early teenage years begin to wash over her like stepping into a scalding shower. “You’re an…”A“Alpha, yes. I’m surprised you didn’t pick up on it, Molly,” he growled, his thumb moving slowly over her clit.AMolly arched up, her mouth open wide as she felt him slip a finger into her increasingly wet channel. She knew her heat would make her insatiable, something it appeared he wanted.A“I was a little distracted with waking you and then you taking over our ship. I don’t even know your name,” she groaned, her eyes squeezed shut as she tried to stave off what was naturally happening.AShe could smell him now, that deep, musky scent that was purely Alpha. It was something to behold truly, but even more so was how she hadn’t recognized it before when her hand was wrapped around his cock. He was larger than most men she had been with, but knowing her own biology, and his, she knew, despite the first thought of surely not, he would fit within her and the base would continue to swell until she was begging for his knot. The pure masculine scent of him was enough to make her sex drive insane, multiplied ten fold by her burgeoning heat, she could only allow herself to lie victim to his plan.AShe keened, her voice gasping and high as she felt that thick cock rubbing against her swollen folds. Her heat was getting worse, the dull ache in her abdomen growing worse as she felt the rush of arousal coursing through her.A“My name is Khan. Khan Noonien Singh,” he growled, reaching up as he continued to brush against her, to shove her dress over her breasts. He pulled down the lacey cups and leaned over her to attach his mouth to her pert mounds. She hummed happily as his tongue flicked over her nipple before he moved to the other one. Molly gasped as she began to feel wetness trailing down her leg and her heat only intensify further. He could sense the change in her, could sense the change in the air as he withdrew, his eyes dark as he pulled away.A“Give it to me, please,” she pleaded, her fingers curling to her palm, her nails digging into the flesh as she tried to ground herself.AKhan crouched down, his finger trailing along the inside of her thigh. “Not yet,” he murmured before he bought his face to the apex of her legs and licked a long stripe up her sex. Molly arched her back, her mouth open in a silent yell as he flicked his tongue over her sensitive nub and his finger curled inside her.A“Please, Khan…” she wailed as he sucked on her clit. He lifted his head, his lips and chin shining with her arousal as he pulled her back toward him again. He took himself in hand and slowly began to ease into her, inch by inch. Molly’s head fell back with a thud against the console as the burn of her heat intensified as he sank into her. Khan, once fully seated, leaned over her, his lips attaching to the sweet skin of her neck and with a shaky inhale, he began to move.AMolly’s hands grappled to find a place to hold onto until she elected to wrap her arms around Khan, her fingernails digging into the sweat slicked skin of his back. His lips were eager against her neck, sucking hard before brushing lightly over what she was sure would be marks in a few hours. His hips slammed against hers in a rush. There would be time later to slow down, to enjoy the feel of each other, to allow the connection to take place, but that was not this moment. She would rather fuck away the burn than to draw it out at a slow pace.AWith each thrust of his hips, hers surged up to meet him. She could feel the base of his cock growing thicker and just felt her own body betraying her, preparing her for his knot. Sometimes she wanted to curse her biology and her genetic make up for being this way. Why couldn’t she be just another lowly beta and suffer from normal urges? She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and bit down as she felt her orgasm on the verge of tearing a scream from her throat. The ship was empty; no one would hear her. His hips became erratic and with one well-placed thrust, she screamed and came undone. With a loud groan, Khan thrust against her, his knot pushing into her and locking him in place. He crashed his lips to hers as he came, the walls of her cunt milking him for all he was worth.AHis thoughts were jumbled as he kissed her cheeks, her forehead, and her neck. Oh her neck, so sweet and full of life. Her very own life essence coursed through those veins. He dragged his teeth along her skin, reveling in the shiver. “Do you want me to mark you, to bond with you, to make you my queen?” he growled, punctuating himself with a bruising kiss to her neck.AMolly looked up at him, her eyes unfocused. “I…” she began, before she reached up and brushed her hair aside, turning her head to bare her neck to him.AHe reached over and turned her head back, capturing her lips in a surprisingly chaste kiss. “You are mine, Molly Hooper,” he growled as his cock twitched again and her walls clamped down, her whimpers edging him on. He scraped his teeth along her neck before he bit down, tugging the skin raw around a prominent bruise. She clutched him tighter, her fingernails scraping his back. His tongue trailed lazily along the fresh wound he exposed on her neck, ensuring his own genetic material entered her system, bonding her to him.AHe groaned again, his head falling forward to rest between her breasts, as what he hoped would be the last wave crossed over them. Her hands found his slick hair, her fingers carding the dark locks through them as she kept her legs wrapped around his hips.AFinally, as the last aftershocks ebbed, and his knot had deflated enough, he pulled out of her. She slid off the helm and he caught her before she hit the floor.A“Thanks,” she mumbled, not trusting her legs as her heat subsided slightly. She knew it would be back and once more Khan would take her, giving her his seed with the intent of insemination. She knew the likelihood, and was surprisingly calm about it. Khan scooped her up after he kicked his trousers aside, finally unwinding them from his ankles, and carried her away from the helm.AHe brought her down to the crew’s quarters and carefully chose a bed, laying her on it gently. She curled up on her side. But as he made to leave, her hand reached out. “Where are you going?”A“To get something for your neck,” he replied.A“Stay. You’ll just reopen it again with the next wave. It can wait.” She tugged on his wrist and smiled as he climbed into bed beside her, pulling the blanket over them as he wrapped around her. She rolled over and faced him, raising her hand to brush away his errant fringe.A“Tell me your story, Khan,” she murmured.",Only the Beginning,2278

Naturally, Sherlock and John are among the first people she invites. It takes much prodding, a bribe or two, and maybe a threat on John's part to convince Sherlock to go with him, but in the end Sherlock relents and agrees. That just leaves the matter of costumes.","A""No."" Sherlock opened his laptop and started typing, long fingers flying across the keyboard without pause and without mistake.""Sherlock, come on. Please,"" John said from near the door, exasperated.""No. I agreed to go with you but I refuse to wear some silly costume. It's childish, John,"" John's infuriating boyfriend rumbled without looking at him.""It's just for fun, love, and you'll only be wearing it for a few hours,"" he entreated.""No.""""Sherlock, get up and get your coat on, you are coming with me to buy a costume and you are wearing it to Molly's party,"" John told him sternly. ""Or you will wear whatever I choose for you.""""Or,"" Sherlock countered, ""I will continue to sit here and work, and I will wear my usual attire to the party. I'll leave you to deduce which of those options I've chosen.""John sighed. Fine. He shoved his arms into his coat and his feet into his shoes, then crossed the room. He stopped in front of Sherlock, not saying anything for a moment. The detective still was focused solely on whatever he was typing.""At least look up from that long enough to give me a kiss,"" he said. This time Sherlock obeyed. He sat the laptop to the side and looked up at John pointedly. John resisted the urge to roll his eyes, instead leaning down to press a chaste kiss on Sherlock's lips, which he returned. Plush flesh met slightly chapped flesh, clung, separated, then brushed again before John drew back and moved to straighten up.He was stopped by Sherlock's hands on the back of his neck, pulling him back for another kiss. John pulled his mouth away again.""Sherlock, my cab will be here any second, I have to go before the shops all close,"" he admonished, peeling the large hands off of his neck and standing up straight. Sherlock just gave a hmph.""Fine,"" he huffed. He looked up at John with a slight pout. ""Just one more then? Please."" John held in a sigh. For a moment he considered walking away, but he never could say no to him. He leaned down again to give Sherlock's lips just a peck.As soon as their lips connected, Sherlock's arms wrapped tightly around John and pulled him down into his lap in one swift motion.""Sherlock-"" John managed to pull his mouth away, but Sherlock chased it with his own, recapturing it before John could protest further. He licked his way past John's lips and teeth to brush his tongue along John's. That's when John realized what Sherlock was trying to do. He fought his arms out of Sherlock's grip to put his hands on his broad shoulders and put some distance between them.""Sherlock, let go of me,"" he commanded, slightly irritated. Sherlock held his stare and tightened his arms.""No.""""Sherlock, let go or I will hurt you,"" John warned. They glared at each other for another handful of seconds before Sherlock sighed his relent. He unraveled his arms. John immediately stood and stepped out of his reach, then zipped his coat up. Sherlock took his laptop up again, typing furiously, his expression somewhere between stony and petulant. John couldn't help but smile. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock's forehead.""I won't be gone long,"" he promised.Sherlock just gave another hmph in reply.""I love you, too."" And with that, John took his leave.A little over three hours had passed before the cab pulled up outside of 221 Baker Street. John paid the cabbie and got out with his bag. He was a little aggravated at the limited selection of costumes he'd had to choose from that he liked and that fit him, but overall he was pleased with his purchases.He had ended up buying their costumes, and something extra for Sherlock, after an idea aimed to change his mind about costumes had bloomed in John's head whilst browsing at the shop. He just hoped his idea would work.John took the stairs two at a time, shutting the door behind him as soon as he made it up to the flat he shared with Sherlock. He dropped the bag to shrug off his coat and kick out of his shoes, then hung his coat before glancing around for Sherlock.The detective was stretched out on the sofa, lying in the usual pose he took up when he was thinking. He had changed out of his suit and now wore a pair of his pajama bottoms, one of John's old t-shirts, and his own blue dressing gown. The tattered old clothing did nothing to diminish the man's beauty.John bent down and kissed his furrowed brow. The touch made Sherlock's expression clear and his eyes move to John. He must've been in his mind palace.""I got you something,"" John told him. Sherlock shot him a withering look. ""Don't. I really think you'll like it."" Sherlock twisted awkwardly to look skeptically at the bag by the door. John had had the cashiers at both shops put everything in the one bag, so as to maybe throw Sherlock off and surprise him.""I'm still not wearing a costume,"" Sherlock sneered, then rolled on his side and curled into a ball with his back to John. Did I really just pull one over on Sherlock Holmes?""Fine,"" John replied. He picked the bag up and took it to their bedroom, pulling the door shut behind him. He sifted through the bag and quickly pulled out what he was looking for then dropped the bag on the floor beside the wardrobe.This had bloody well better work. John undressed and changed his clothes fairly quickly. His hand was on the doorknob minutes later. He exhaled a long breath before turning it then thudding down the hallway and into the living room at a leisurely pace. He stopped a few feet away from where Sherlock still lay curled up on the couch. Several seconds ticked by in silence.""John, hand me my phone,"" Sherlock said without turning around. He was answered with more silence. Only after there was no sound from John except for his breathing did he move. He glanced over his shoulder, registered John's presence, turned his head back to the sofa for a moment before whipping it around again to actually look at John, as though doing a double take.John stood there in an authoritative pose, watching Sherlock sit up and turn around to look him up and down. His pale eyes took in the sexy (and tight) police officer costume John had purchased from a sex shop not far from Baker Street (the boots, though, had been a friend's Christmas present to John from ages ago, never worn until now, and would never be worn again.)Eventually, Sherlock's gaze roamed back up to John's eyes. ""What's this for?"" he inquired, his expression indifferent.""You've been a bad man, Holmes,"" John answered, taking up a commanding tone.""Oh?"" Sherlock cocked an elegant eyebrow. ""Is that so?"" John nodded.""By refusing to wear a costume, you've refused an officer of the law,"" he told him. Sherlock stood and sauntered the distance between them, stopping close enough to John that John could feel the heat coming off his body.""Problem, officer?""  Sherlock emphasized the second word with a graceful raise of his eyebrows.""For you, maybe. I might have to arrest you for that,"" John responded.""Mmmh. Under what charges?"" Sherlock asked. He languidly swaggered around John. John could feel his eyes roving over his body again.""Whatever charges I choose,"" John stated, moving to turn around to face Sherlock. Then there were hands groping his arse firmly, and before Sherlock could react he had him pinned up against the nearest wall with his hands behind his back.""Sexual assault of an officer will do nicely,"" John growled in his ear as he took the handcuffs out of the pouch on his belt and shackled Sherlock's slim wrists together, maybe a little too snuggly. He then pulled the taller man from the wall by his grip on his forearms and started leading him down the hallway toward their bedroom.""It was an honest mistake, though, officer,"" Sherlock insisted, letting John lead him.He's actually playing along. This surprised John, but he kept going.""Save it."" He pushed Sherlock down onto their bed. Sherlock landed on his front, but rolled over onto his back to look up at John with an innocent expression.""This is all a misunderstanding,"" he said""Mmm, I don't think it is.""""Surely there's some way to have the charge dropped, some deal that can be made? I'll do anything, officer.""""Hmm. Anything?"" John echoed, raising his eyebrows. Sherlock nodded.""Anything,"" he purred. His voice had lowered four octaves in as many seconds. His face was still set in the same innocent expression but his eyes were smirking. John shut the door then kicked off his boots. He fisted his hand in the front of Sherlock's shirt and pulled him up into a sitting position by that grip, then leaned down so his mouth was right beside his ear.""Here's your deal then: I'll let you off with a warning- after you take my cock like the dirty, grabby whore you are, without question and without complaint. You're going to lay there while I stick every last inch of this big, hard cock into your tight arse and fuck you, and then after I'm finished I'll let you go on your way,"" John growled low before biting down on Sherlock's earlobe and sucking at the skin between his teeth. He drew back after a few seconds to look Sherlock in the face. ""Do we have an agreement?""Sherlock closed his slightly parted lips and just nodded. John straightened up, pulling Sherlock after him and onto his feet. He mouthed at the ivory skin of his neck while reaching around to unlock the handcuffs then setting them on the nightstand. Sherlock inhaled a sharp hiss when John sank his teeth into his throat. John pushed the dressing gown off of him and heard it make a soft sound upon settling on the floor. Sherlock's hands grabbed onto John's arse to pull him closer, but John growled and bit down harder- not hard enough to hurt him, though.""Ah-ah. That's what got you into this, remember?"" he chided against Sherlock's skin, his tongue coming out to taste the area where his pulse beat rapidly. The hands on John's arse vanished.John slid his hands under the hem of the t-shirt and they creeped up Sherlock's torso, pulling the shirt with it. Sherlock let out a small gasp when John's thumbs found his nipples under the shirt, just before John leaned back enough to pull the shirt off. He gave a louder gasp when John's mouth closed around one of the hard nubs of flesh and sucked while his hands moved to the waistband of his pajama bottoms, which joined the rest of the clothing on the floor. He wasn't wearing pants underneath.John gave his attention to the other nipple before pulling away and roughly pushing Sherlock back onto the bed. He drank in the sight of the gorgeous, nude body laid out in front of him while he undressed himself, biting back a groan when his gaze came to the flushed erection between Sherlock's legs. He undressed faster.Sherlock watched him strip. There were red marks on his thighs that looked like he'd squeezed them to keep from squeezing John's arse again. Blood suddenly seemed to rush even faster to John's half-hard cock, which had just been freed as the last bit of what little clothing he wore dropped to the ground. Sherlock's eyes roamed and took in John's naked form before John got onto the bed and crawled on top of him.Their mouths met with the slide of tongues and the clack of teeth in a hungry kiss. John swallowed Sherlock's groan when his thumbs went back to his nipples, rubbing circles around them, but couldn't swallow his own when Sherlock rolled his hips against him and he felt his rigid cock rub against his arse. His own cock leapt to full attention.Neither of them broke the kiss until they had to separate for air, their breathing heavy and ragged. John shifted off of Sherlock.""Move,"" he told him, directing him with his hands just for a moment before Sherlock knew how he wanted him and obeyed. He looked up at John with eyes blown apart by lust once he was settled and John was straddling his hips again. John admired how lovely his dark hair looked splayed out on the white pillows and ran a gentle hand through those curls before ducking down to recapture his swollen, red mouth.This kiss was less hungry and more heated, without teeth but with possibly more tongue. Without moving his mouth off of Sherlock's, John reached over and plucked the handcuffs off of the nightstand, and also fished the lube out of the drawer. He sat the lube behind him by his foot, then in one quick move had Sherlock's hands handcuffed to the headboard. His tongue slid against Sherlock's for a minute more before he pulled his mouth away to suck a lovebite on the side of Sherlock's neck.He kept moving down, pushing Sherlock's thighs apart and settling between them. John nipped at the groove at the base of his throat, pulling a shuddering breathy sound from him. He licked all along Sherlock's collarbone, then latched onto his nipple. He simultaneously bit down (carefully) on the hard flesh, sucked on it, and lapped at it with the tip of his tongue, while lightly pinching the other nipple between his thumb and index finger. Sherlock made a soft keening sound, his hips jerked.John switched sides and repeated the process after a moment, resulting in another sound floating from Sherlock's mouth that should've made him snicker but instead- somehow- turned him on even more. After a time he moved on, peppering wet kisses down Sherlock's stomach and abdomen. Both of them were breathing raggedly by the time John's hand wrapped around the base of Sherlock's cock.He dragged his tongue up the grooved underside of the shaft, slowly, lapping up the precome that glistened at the tip. Sherlock made another impossibly arousing noise above him. John glanced up and saw Sherlock watching him with his mouth open in a silent sound of pleasure. He met his gaze and held it while parting his lips and lowering them down around the first couple inches of his cock. Sherlock groaned and watched as John drew back, suckled on the tip for a long moment, then pulled his mouth off with a wet popping sound.John licked around the tip for a moment while he found the bottle of lubricant and slicked three fingers. He nudged Sherlock's thighs farther apart then slid a finger between his arsecheeks to rub and tease the tight ring of muscle within. He waited until Sherlock felt ready before he pushed his finger slowly, carefully into his body at the same time as he swallowed down a few inches of his cock.Sherlock keened quietly. John hollowed his cheeks to give hopefully just the right amount of suction as he pulled back, then slid back down. He glanced up at Sherlock while he repeated the movements, raising his eyebrows in an unspoken question. Sherlock nodded, and John added a second finger in beside the first, taking a little more of Sherlock's hard length in his mouth while he slid it in. He gave Sherlock a moment to adjust before gingerly scissoring his fingers inside of him, stretching him a little more. Sherlock inhaled sharply.Soon, John had three fingers buried inside of Sherlock and had as much of his cock in his mouth as he was able to take. His own neglected cock was screaming for attention, though he ignored it as best as he could.""Please,"" Sherlock's voice was rich and needy when he finally spoke. ""I'm ready, please fuck me."" John pulled his mouth off of him and pulled his fingers out of him, more than happy to oblige. He uncapped the lube and poured a generous amount into his hand before setting the bottle aside, then slicked himself, moaning at how good the attention to his raging erection felt as cool liquid slid up and down the length.With one hand on the bed to steady himself, John used his other to guide himself between Sherlock's arsecheeks until the tip rested inside Sherlock's stretched hole. He leaned up to press a kiss to Sherlock's lips, putting his weight on his arms on either side of Sherlock's shoulders, and then held his turquoise gaze while he pushed in slowly but a little impatiently, groaning low when he was fully sheathed. He brushed kisses to Sherlock's damp forehead while he gave him time to adjust.Sherlock nodded several seconds later. John planted a kiss at the part in his hair then started to move. He drew back as far as he could before pushing back into tight heat. Sherlock lifted his hips up to meet his thrust and take him deeper with a shaky sigh. John moved his hips slowly at first, but they quickly gathered speed and settled into a rhythm.""Harder,"" Sherlock breathed. John shifted position so that he was holding Sherlock's hips higher off of the bed by a grip on his arse, then started to piston into Sherlock with more force.John knew that neither of them were going to last very long. He let his forehead drop against the side of Sherlock's neck as he sped up some, hands squeezing the firm flesh in their grip. The only sounds in the room were their panting, and the sound of flesh moving against flesh. Sherlock's legs wrapped around him, pulling him in even closer. John heard the rattling sound that announced that Sherlock was trying to pull out of the handcuffs, then a whimper as he gave up a minute later.""Touch me,"" he implored in a breathy rumble. ""For Christ's sake, John, please touch me, fuck."" John paused to sit up and quickly change position again. He unwrapped one of Sherlock's legs from around his waist and pulled it up until the back of his knee rested on John's shoulder, then planted the foot on the same side of his body firmly on the mattress so that he was kneeling. He kept the grip on Sherlock's arse with one hand and wrapped his other around Sherlock's cock. He slicked the precome at the tip down the shaft as he started stroking, then starting thrusting hard.""Oh, God,"" Sherlock groaned out, rolling his hips and throwing his head back. ""God, oh fuck, yes, fuck me just like that."" John slammed into Sherlock even deeper than before while Sherlock rolled his hips again, giving another groan and arching his back. They watched each other through lowered lashes as John fucked into Sherlock and Sherlock fucked himself onto John.John felt his orgasm pooling at the base of his spine and growing, but he tried to push it away. He wanted to see Sherlock come first- he always did. He loved to watch him lose control like he was starting to now, rolling his hips with John's thrusts and making small, inarticulate noises of pleasure through his panting each time John's cock touched his prostate.But it was John who came first. Orgasm crashed over him like a tsunami wave, engulfing him, devouring him. His hips stuttered through several more thrusts, then jerked twice, and he was coming deep, deep inside of Sherlock with a shout. His movements slowed to a stop as wave after wave overtook him, made all the more intense by Sherlock still fucking himself onto John and and into John's hand, letting out keens and groans. His body hunched over Sherlock's and he pressed his forehead against Sherlock's jaw. The room spinned just a bit.John didn't know how much time passed before he had ridden out his orgasm and the room came to a halt, but he did know that Sherlock was still going. He pushed aside his sudden exhaustion and excructiating need to hold Sherlock's body close to his and fall asleep, focusing on moving his hand on Sherlock's cock in long, fast strokes. He leaned back enough to watch the squirming man underneath him.It didn't take much. Several strokes, and Sherlock's back was arching, his eyes clenched shut, and he came calling John's name. John kept going until he had wrung out every drop of come from Sherlock's cock. The warm liquid covered John's hand and Sherlock's stomach and abdomen. Once the flow ceased, John pulled out and stretched to grab his t-shirt off of the floor. He meant to wipe them both off, but stopped to admire the view of Sherlock handcuffed, debauched, and thoroughly shagged.John leaned forward to kiss Sherlock's lips. ""You're so gorgeous like this, love,"" he told him, brushing his damp hair back off of his forehead before it dried stuck to the skin.""You're gorgeous all of the time,"" he rumbled, looking at John through heavy eyelids and giving him the faintest of smiles. John heard the exhaustion in his voice. He kissed the scar near the corner of his bottom lip, then cleaned the both of them off. He found the key to the handcuffs and freed Sherlock, who immediately pulled John against him and held him there tightly. John smiled. He also loved to see Sherlock like this.He moved to get out of bed after a few moments of letting Sherlock hold him, but Sherlock made a sound of protest and held tighter.""Sherlock, let me up. I'm just pissing and turning the lights off,"" he told him patiently. Sherlock relented with a sleepy huff. John disentangled himself from Sherlock's grasp and took care of his suddenly full bladder and the lights throughout the flat quickly, then returned to the bedroom in minutes. Sherlock hadn't moved. John flicked off the lamp on the nightstand before getting under the covers.Now Sherlock moved. He squirmed his way under the covers and wrapped his arms around John again, holding him close. His legs tangled with John's and their bodies pressed against each other at almost every point possible. He hummed his contentment.But John still had a point to prove.""Still think costumes are silly and childish?"" he asked Sherlock, then yawned. Sherlock sighed.""Don't ruin it,"" he grumbled, leaning his forehead against John's. John smiled and kissed his bottom lip. He knew he'd won.""So you'll wear a costume to the party, then?"" He draped one arm over Sherlock's waist and tucked the other one comfortably under his pillow, a part of him holding his breath waiting for Sherlock to answer."".....Yes.""","Problem, Officer?",3837

/>Sherlock却渴望粗暴一些。,ASherlock醒于仪器的嗡鸣声，睁开眼，他看见John靠在病床边熟睡的样子，还感觉身上剧烈的痛。A    不自觉地，他痛得呻吟。John醒了。John的前额有点儿皱纹，是不安而关切的标志，但他对着Sherlock，却有些疲惫地微笑着。A    “Sherlock，感谢上帝，你醒了。还记得昏迷前发生什么事吗？”A    “我中了枪。”Sherlock声音沙哑。John为他按下吗啡止痛，他扯了扯嘴角道谢。“你瘦很多。”A    “这几天没心情吃饭。”John回答，不自在地揉着手腕。手腕的皮肤很红。John最近戴过手铐。A    “我什么时候可以回家？”A    “等你下次睡醒，不那么痛的时候。”John向他保证着。John用拇指轻轻地抚摸Sherlock的手指，直到他再度睡去。A——A    Sherlock想说他可以自己坐出租回家，看看John的表情，最终决定闭嘴。John跟他走出医院，钻进Mycroft的黑色轿车，没有人说话，在沉默中车开远了。A    到达贝克街时Mrs.Hudson已经睡下，所以他们尽量放慢速度，放轻脚步地上楼。Sherlock说自己没事但John不理他，反而拉过Sherlock的一条胳膊环住自己肩膀，支撑着他大部分的体重，一点一点地爬上楼梯。A    进了房间，John动作很轻地为他解下大衣，好像怕他会碎掉似地。他叫Sherlock别动，下楼拿了止痛泵上来。A    Sherlock太累洗不动澡——是说浴室也没法用，因为最后一次出门前Sherlock正在里面搞一个实验，各种果酱的不同粘稠性之类的——于是John把他带到卧室，帮他换了衣服。Sherlock装作没发现John的视线是如何不断往他胸口的绷带和背后大块伤口上瞄的。最后John转身想走，却一直没迈出步子。A    “楼上的卧室还空着。”Sherlock主动开口。A    John没说话，慢慢走到他的床前。Sherlock还坐着，他四下张望着就是不肯正面John的眼睛，直到传来太过熟悉的有人倒地的声音。John的那条腿终于站不住了。A    “痛吗？”Sherlock问，他想站起来去搀扶John，但John抓住了他硬把他按下去。John把额头轻轻地靠在Sherlock的膝盖上，就那样一动不动。他的呼吸很热，又很粗重，Sherlock隔着睡裤的布料都能感受到那份热意。A    Sherlock看着John的手。手腕皮肤很红，快要破了；John并没有真的在金属手铐里挣扎，但肯定有摩擦到。“最近你被逮捕过。”A    John既没有对他这语焉不详的推测开玩笑，也没有直接承认。他坐在那里呼吸Sherlock的气息。A    “Lestrade逮捕你的？”A    “对。”A    “为什么？”A    “我走开了才五分钟，回来就看到Mary在掐你脖子。”A    “啊啊。”Sherlock说，片刻后才反应过来——“啊啊。”A    “就是那样。”John叹息，却不肯再多说什么了。A    “他应该给予你警告后就释放了吧。”Sherlock说，希望这件事就此结束。A    “他的确给我警告了。不过是后来的事，你在手术台上停止心跳的时候，我不得不被其他外科医硬从你身边拉开……”A    “我还有些药膏。”Sherlock突然打断他，向床头柜伸手。A    John站起来，坐到他旁边，握住他的手。Sherlock完全地，彻底地停下动作。“我已经看你死了两次——第二次甚至是真实的。”A    Sherlock的喉咙发紧，他抬头，John面无表情，声音轻柔，却因怒火而颤抖。A    “你不能再这样对我。”John说，垮下脸，然后吻住他。A——A    他们很快开始了——或者说继续——交往，身体接触的次数也大大增加。John会那样温和而不失自信地吻他，让Sherlock感到平静，感到安宁；John会不断地不断地在任何时候吻他。A    给他端茶的时候会接吻。一起看很难看的犯罪电视剧时，为了让Sherlock闭嘴时会接吻。深夜，睡不着的Sherlock拉起小提琴的时候，也会接吻。John把Sherlock吻得放下小提琴，跟他到床上去。A    有时候他们就安静地躺在床上，Sherlock的脑袋枕着John的肚子，让John规律的呼吸带他入眠。另外的时候，John的体重令人安心地压制着他，他们的腿交缠着，吻个不停，直到气氛太火热无需衣服的存在。接下来的时候，Sherlock会握住两人的性器套弄至高潮，或者被John吻遍全身，哀求他给自己一次口活。还有的时候，John的手指插入他体内，将他扩张得够松软，然后他们做爱。太轻柔太缓慢了，Sherlock只能无助地扭动，和John做爱总是这样温柔而甜蜜，甜蜜得令Sherlock会哭。A    不管他们做什么John都很温柔，仿佛停不下来似地亲吻他。但Sherlock却希望他的John能用一种比较粗暴的方式——有力的，强势的。他想要John用力吻他，弄肿他的嘴唇，让他流血更好。他想要John在他用小提琴扰人清梦时，把尸体手指放在冰箱的鸡柳条上面时，乃至不跟任何人打招呼就擅自追赶嫌疑人时，向他发火。A    他渴望着坐出租回家途中John的怒火就在体内酝酿，一到家关上门就爆发出来，把他按在客厅墙上。他渴望John能愤怒而急切地、惩罚性地吻他，撕开他的衣服逼他跪下。他渴望着John能拉扯他的头发，操他的嘴。他渴望能有一个粗暴的，充满占有欲的，苛刻的John。A    但John不肯做任何会伤害他的事。Sherlock知道自己的欲望只能让John难过，继而远离。他不想John走。所以这些幻想就只存在于他脑海中，只是幻想。A——A    从那时算起有两个月了。Sherlock的伤口已愈，胸膛上留有一道疤痕。John吻得很虔诚，尽管带着些悲伤。所以Sherlock平常都不在乎这疤痕。只有今天不一样。今天他没法不在乎。今天很无聊，无聊，无聊。A    一个案子都没有。为什么没有？为什么今天到处都那么无聊？A    Sherlock向John望去，John坐在那把讨厌的椅子里，用两根讨厌的手指在讨厌的电脑上以讨厌的龟速打着字，将上一个案子某些讨厌的荒谬细节写进他那讨厌的博客里。A    Sherlock闭上眼。这无济于事。他能感觉沙发套滑稽可笑的质地，听见键盘超烦人的嗒嗒嗒声，闻到厨房里他早先做实验残留的异味。为什么不肯停下？他的大脑没法负担这么多的感受。他的确可以离开这里，但那就意味着他要远离John，投入尼古丁贴片的怀抱；他多么想要那么做；可手臂上已经贴了三张，他答应过John不会再——A    “嘿，小心了！再用力就会弄坏的。那可是个礼物你知道吗。”John说着。为何John听起来那么愉快？为何John无法理解Sherlock正在饱受折磨？Sherlock抬起头，对上John的视线，在米字旗抱枕上狠揍一拳。A    “痛的是你不是我，亲爱的。”John说，“你等于在隔着抱枕揍自己呢。”A    Sherlock一个字都不回答。他转过身不去看John心情颇佳的笑脸——凭什么John这么开心，他却无聊得快要枯槁？——更紧地攥住了怀里的抱枕。由于他忙着推断——才不是生闷气——John的抱枕有何故事，就没有察觉John关上笔记本电脑来到他身边。A    “好吧，Sherlock，坐起来。”A    “为什么？”Sherlock气呼呼地反问，“全世界都很无聊，很讨厌！”A    “真的？我可搞不清你这么生气——”A    “我没有在生气！”A    “好吧，行，”John愉快地配合着他，“你没有生气。开心了吗？坐起来，我要给你按摩一下。”A    “按摩干嘛非要我坐起来？”Sherlock没好气地问。（无所事事让他容易小题大做，挑三拣四，不过他不会告诉John的，John只会朝他宠溺一笑。）A    “因为我要按摩你的头颅。”A    Sherlock扬起脸，与John四目相对，好奇的表情。John站在沙发背后。“我的头颅？”A    “是啊，头颅，就是容纳你大脑的那个东西。”John还说得很深情款款，“好吧，我知道，那个描述很不准确。抱歉，作为医生我应该有更好的表达。坐起来好吗？”A    “为什么？”A    “你很无聊，而我想太太平平地写个博客。现在，坐直了。”John轻快地要求。A    “我是在受苦。”Sherlock纠正他，心不甘情不愿地坐起来，抱枕还抓在胸前。John立刻把双手放到Sherlock的发间，硬朗的手指散发出热度，从他的头皮一路渗透到脚趾。John在他头皮上小幅地打着圈。A    “这样好吗？按压得够不够？要我减轻一点力道？”John问，手已经滑到他的后脑。A    Sherlock没有回答。光是要保持呼吸的平稳就耗光他的意志力。已经许多年没有被这样触碰过了——每次Sherlock跪到John面前，John的手总是安分守己，令人失望。Sherlock还没有勃起，不过也快了，每一次施压，每一下按摩，每一个触碰都直接作用在他的性器上。他从未如此感激盖在大腿上的抱枕。A    “Sherlock？”A    “嗯？”Sherlock挣扎着回话。要把注意力从情欲火热的腿间转移到别的地方，越来越困难了。A    “这样好吗？”A    “我又没有抱怨，你难道猜不出来吗，John？”A    “现在你的脑袋可在我手里。”John用虚张声势的危险口吻与他开玩笑，“如果我是你，会管好自己的嘴巴。”A    Sherlock闭上眼。John的话让他又开始想象John的嘴巴了。不错。John的嘴巴吻在他的脖子上，他的背脊上，他的老二上——A    他往右挪了一点。John也跟着往右。他大概流了好些前液，睡裤都变湿了。看来内裤还是一项有用的发明啊。A    “Sherlock？”A    “又怎么了，John？”Sherlock口气恶劣。他必须保持冷静，注意着不让John发现。正确地说是，设法注意着。因为前提是他还能集中精神……A    不能让John知道。不能让John知道每当他去上班，Sherlock就喜欢回到他们的卧室里，跪在床上，臀部翘在空中，大张着双腿好让那个粉嫩的小洞完全暴露在外，暴露在后方不存在的John的眼前。他用一根沾满润滑剂的手指玩弄皱褶，在敏感的入口处搔刮到无法忍耐才浅浅地插入，而只有当他连腿都开始打颤，并且始终服从John的命令，保持安静地一动不动，才会被允许插入第二根。A    当Sherlock已经伸进三根手指扩张自己，John就会叫他不许再用手指了，把他的手指从那个下流的小洞里把出来换上John的阴茎。随后Sherlock就一边想象John的手按在他的后颈，将他压进枕头里，一边急切地蹭着床单用手指操着后穴。他的身上和床单上都是汗和前液。A    John不能知道当Sherlock闭上眼时，幻想的是John插在他体内，小穴被John粗壮的阴茎大大地撑开。John的手抓着他的腰，用力得会留下可爱的青紫淤痕，John用那根阴茎反复操他，操得他眼睛发花。A    这些都不能让John知道：Sherlock沉溺于幻想，幻想John侵犯他，肉体拍击，John喘息着呼喊他的名字。当John特别生气的时候，就会想办法在他已经被塞满的小洞里再加一根手指，而Sherlock会呜咽，会痛得全身发颤；John强迫他看着，说：“来，含进去，吃掉它，我知道你能行，你一定得让我进去，快点，乖，就这样，上帝，你的感觉太棒了……”Sherlock只能咬着棉被，“求求你，John，求你，再来，再来，还要”地反复苦苦哀求，最后射在床单上，眨着眼睛回过神，才意识到那只是一场梦——A    “你那颗宝贝大脑平静下来了吗？”A    “如果不必忍受你这单调的提问就好了。”Sherlock不屑一顾，嗤之以鼻，“以后务必在记录下荒谬的案件细节时先咨询一下我。”A    “没人想看你那些细节好吗，Sherlock。你觉得有趣的东西在普通人眼里相当无聊。”A    “你的博客就是无聊的产物。”Sherlock忿忿道。A    “你才是无聊的产物。”John亲昵地拉了拉他的卷毛。A    Sherlock张开嘴想说：“那你是有多成熟”的，但却变成了呻吟。他立刻僵住了，背挺得很直，闭上眼睛咬紧牙齿。该死，该死，该死！A    John的手也不动了，不过还停留在他的发间。在那样一个踌躇不决的停顿后，John打破安静：“Sherlock？”A    “嗯？”Sherlock的喉咙有点哑，犹如细语一般，“又干嘛？”A    “你还好？”A    “我的发根毛囊十分敏感。”Sherlock的话是一个字一个字从牙缝里挤出来的，“随便拉拉我的头发，我就愿意跪下来任你予取予求。这个回答你满意吗？”A    John继续按摩，只是速度变慢了，揉着大大的圆。他那漫不经心的声音太具欺骗性，若Sherlock没有花了那么多日子试图挑起他的怒火以期遭受处罚——比如在冰箱里放各种尸体零件，在糖罐里放各种不是糖霜的白色粉末，将牛奶全部用于做实验等等——的话，他肯定感觉不出那话语中隐藏的紧张感。“你以前是怎么干的？心情不好又没有手枪朝墙壁射击的时候？”A    “大学的时候，我会去找个同学。”Sherlock说得笼统。那回忆让他颤栗，要与John分享那回忆更让他颤栗。A    “真的？我还以为那种事会让你更不爽？”A    什么？啊啊。“会，”Sherlock承认道，“但我不是去找他买可卡因。可卡因是后来的事了。我找他做爱。除了他没人能粗暴到令我满意。”A    John的手不动了。“好吧。”他说着，清了清嗓子，“我——”A    “怎样？”Sherlock防备地问，“我从不——算了。忘了它。忘了刚才的对话。全部忘干净。喔，等等，你忘不了，你的大脑不会删除——”A    “Sherlock，”John轻声说，呼唤他的注意，“你是否——”A    他们不该谈这事。不该。就是不该。John会知道的，会赌咒发誓说自己绝不会伤害Sherlock，然后就离开。John不能走，不能。A    “Sherlock。”John又喊了一声。Sherlock决心无视他。如果无视够久，John说不定就放弃了，这个话题从此就再也不会被提起。A    John又拉了拉他的头发，这次十分用力，扯得Sherlock低低地惊叫。然后John拉第三下，卷毛紧攥在手里不放，尖锐的痛令Sherlock晕眩。A    “你要干什么？”他喘着问。A    “让你集中精神。”John温和地说，“就算是我，也看得出来为什么你还把那抱枕盖在大腿上的。如果你愿意，我有点东西想试试。”A    Sherlock挣扎着试图思考。他该怎么回答？一部分的大脑在尖叫是的是的我愿意，但另一部分又很明白，他必须立刻到此为止。因为Sherlock需要John。需要John给他泡茶，叮嘱他吃饭，为他放进冰箱的东西贴标签。这部分需要远胜于拉扯头发或者嘴里被塞满老二。他需要John留在身边，曾经的他并不了解这一美好之处，曾经——在Mary之前，在假装坠楼之前。而现在如果John离开了，他就不知道该怎么活下去。A    “你愿意吗？回答我。”John问，一只手仍然抓着他的头发，另一只手轻轻捧着他的脸，迫他抬头面对自己的视线。两种感触的对比使Sherlock愈发混乱。最终，疼痛战胜了温柔，牢牢地钉住他，让他在欲望下颤抖不已。Sherlock的思维很清明。异常地、前所未有地清明，平和。“Sherlock。”A    “我愿意，求你。”Sherlock急促地呼吸，他只来得及说出这几个字就被John激烈地吻住了，软化的速度好羞耻。A    等他们因为缺氧而结束亲吻，John一把将他拖下沙发，坐上了Sherlock原本的位置，张开腿。“脱光。跪下。”A    Sherlock的膝盖撞击到地板的声音很响，但响不过他的喘息。A    “不行的话随时喊停。解开我的牛仔裤。”A    Sherlock伸手去摸他的拉链，被John拍开。John的眼睛很亮。A    “不许用手。背到后面去。”A    啊啊，神啊。Sherlock重重地吞口水，战栗地靠近John的腿间。John双手搭在膝盖上，样子放松又随意，拳头却捏的很紧。Sherlock花了一点儿力气迅速解开John的牛仔裤。拉链很好解决，连看都不必看，所以他抬眼望向John，却意识到对方也正凝视着自己，目光瞑暗，不带一丝笑意。John看起来很危险，这样的John使Sherlock情不自禁地呜咽。A    “好孩子。”John轻叹，“把我的老二拿出来。”A    Sherlock把John的红色内裤弄得到处是口水，John微微抬起腰，方便他用牙齿咬住布料往下拉扯。那根粗长的阴茎已经完全勃起了，甚至看得出上面的脉动，这画面使Sherlock自己也抽痛不已。A    “吸它。”接下来John这么说。Sherlock急切地凑上去，先是从下到上舔了一遍，而后全部含进口中。John以前从不让他这么做，用不想伤害他的理由予以拒绝；而现在John就非但毫无排斥之意，还在帮忙：他的手插在Sherlock头发里，挺腰朝他喉咙里塞进更多，就像是一个可以无限循环的过程，Sherlock的口水沾湿他的阴茎然后再吸干净，反复地吞吐他，使得John手里抓得更紧。Sherlock因痛楚而眼前发白，但他持续着吸吮和吞吐，双手也交握在背后，克制住抚慰自己的冲动。A    John必须用力拉扯他的头发才能让他停止；他们互相凝视了片刻，粗喘着，Sherlock几乎已经透不过气了。A    “求求你。”他哀求道，试图回味John的感触而吞咽着，喉结滑动。John让其他的杂乱无章都远离他而去了；Sherlock只需要John，只需要John继续给他这个。“求你，求你，求求你。”A    “嘘——”John安慰地说，“我就想看看你。知道我看见什么了吗？红肿的嘴唇，睁大的眼睛，刚才的口活让你的头发比平常更乱了——上帝。你比我梦中还要美。从没想象过我可以让你这样跪在面前。我能不能——我要操你的嘴。”A    Sherlock点头，顺从地张开嘴巴，让John全部插进来。一开始John的动作很慢，然后他加快了速度，偶尔停顿着欣赏Sherlock极力不要噎到的样子。A    “就知道你会很擅长这个。”John不稳地说。Sherlock还没来得及缓过气就被John的阴茎重新填满，但他在欲望中太过迷醉，唯有顺从地让John使用。他的手指在背后绞得时间过长，抽搐着有点痛，但他不在乎。许久John才再度放慢速度，好巨细靡遗地欣赏Sherlock的红唇一次次吞吐着他老二的样子。口水和John的前液遍布他的嘴唇，呻吟也不知羞耻地响亮。“上帝，你太美。我等了这么久，这么久，想不到会这么美妙。看看你。我以为自己不可能看到你这么安静这么听话，象个真正的小婊子似地被我的老二塞着嘴。上帝，你简直棒极了。”A    Sherlock不由自主地，毫无意识地挺腰，悬空扭动着，直至John抓着他的头发把他拉开。A    “不想射在你嘴里。”John说着，手还没放开他，另一只手则在沙发垫子里摸索。A    “操我。”Sherlock呜咽道，被欲望冲昏头脑他已经不觉得话语中有这么赤裸的渴望是件羞耻的事了，“我需要你。操我。”A    “会的，”John说，“得先找到——”他找到了，润滑剂，然后示意Sherlock爬上沙发。Sherlock跪到沙发上，双手不断握拳再松开促进血液循环的恢复，脸朝外，膝盖和手肘支撑着身体。John开始玩弄他的穴口。A    Sherlock不耐地后移，被John制止了。A    “再动，你会后悔。”John警告道。他掰开Sherlock两块丰满的臀瓣，露出的小洞被John的呼吸温热了。他尝试性地在穴口位置轻拍，声响比痛感更令Sherlock分心，不得不压抑着颤栗感。于是John继续打他，手掌分别落在两侧臀瓣和小穴上方。他好像很专注地凝视着Sherlock，被那饱满的肉块摇晃和起伏的样子迷住了似地。Sherlock咬着嘴唇不让自己叫出来，不让自己就这样高潮。A    “好孩子。”John称赞着，舌头舔了上来。Sherlock喜欢John这样舔他，John也同样享受这个过程，不过感觉这么淫荡的还是第一次。John伸着舌头不动，双手扶住Sherlock的腰让他主动。Sherlock在John的舌头上操自己，浅尝辄止完全无法满足他，为了更深的渴望，他开始急躁和匆忙起来，呼吸也断断续续了。John的舌头总能轻易地让他发出丢脸的哭叫。A    Sherlock的小穴已经很松弛了，他主动在John的第一根手指进入时张大腿。John弯曲手指，无情地戳刺Sherlock的前列腺，让他全身发烫。Sherlock死死抓住沙发扶手感觉体内第二根手指的进入，扩张，为John的阴茎到来做好前期工作。A    他的腿发着抖，有一次晃得厉害时还被John一边插入手指一边掌掴教训。不听话John就不干了，如果这么半途而废，Sherlock可能真的会死。他脑子里已经什么都没有，只想要被狠操的愿望；他早就忘记了那个实验留在厨房的异味，也忘记自己多么害怕让John知道这种渴求着被支配的愿望——仅存的全部想法，只有和John做爱。A    John用手扶着他的腰让他改变了姿势，现在Sherlock面朝沙发背了。John站在他身后。难以忍耐地，Sherlock的双手将臀瓣分开，罔顾John的命令主动露出了小洞。A    “求求你了。”他带着哭音，必须用全部的意志力才能阻止自己的手指插进那个早已准备充分的地方。谢天谢地，John很仁慈，他非但没有走开还轻笑着，慢慢地把阴茎插了进去。Sherlock差点哽住。原本他半期待John会把他拖下沙发，命令他去墙角呆着，并目睹John自慰的画面，忍耐好几个小时才有高潮的机会。想到John会懒洋洋地坐在沙发上套弄老二，Sherlock就兴奋地仰头。A    “上帝，你感觉真好。”John急促地喘着，没有动。他每次都会这样，Sherlock有些怀疑他是想要看着自己那根粗壮的阴茎没入Sherlock身体里的样子。如果说Sherlock喜欢巨根，那么John就喜欢看他被巨根插。可惜John已经让他等了太久，Sherlock自己开始动，在John的阴茎上移动着，将之当作活的情趣道具。A    他听见润滑剂瓶子开启的声音，突然动弹不得。因为John把一根润滑过的手指放在阴茎旁边，轻按在他的右臀上，不施加任何压力。A    “这样可以吗？”John问。A    Sherlock的喉咙里发出自己从未听过的，窒息一般的声音，他点了点头，然后把脑袋靠在沙发上闭起眼睛。他的脑海里充斥此时此刻的画面：窗帘半拉开着，阳光在室内洒满暖意，门（可能）锁着，John衣着整齐只有裤子拉链敞开，而Sherlock全身赤裸。John的呼吸安静而沉稳，一根手指挤在阴茎旁边往他体内插，Sherlock的卷发黏在汗津津的额头上。A    John往里捅了一捅。Sherlock被自己的口水噎到了，痛楚让他感到难以置信地、无法形容地填满。每次被John插入他就觉得很满了，但他们的情趣玩具都没有John大，无法和John的阴茎加上手指相提并论。他几乎害怕当自己高潮时身体会不会裂成两半。A    John的另一只手来到他身前，握住他前液直流的阴茎。Sherlock发出无助又凄凉的声音并摇头，他皱着脸，用胳膊挡住自己，双手紧紧抓着沙发都快留下抓痕了，根本无暇挥手让John不要碰。他太兴奋，一个不巧大概就会弄伤John的手指。谢天谢地John明白了这一点，把手挪到Sherlock胸口揉捏起他的乳头。A    “这两个小东西我都没玩够。”John笑道，再一次慢慢往里顶，给Sherlock适应的时间。“你的乳头很敏感。也许下一次我要计算一下，光是玩弄乳头的话，要过多久你才会求我插。这个想法你喜欢么？”A    下一次？Sherlock的大脑无法消化这个概念，没有思考的空间了。不过他仍努力咀嚼了一下，随后就是欣慰感。他的John，他可爱，迷人的John，还想有下一次。A    “Sherlock，”John呼吸急促，“很抱歉，不行——我想好好地干你，但这样做不下去。我能直接干你吗？以后还可以这么玩的，我保证。”A    “好的，好的，你想怎样都可以。”Sherlock呜咽道。他已经在高潮边缘徘徊太久，忘记了其他一切感觉，也不在乎John要干什么，只求他给予此时此刻最急需的东西。John的手指抽了出去，留下一点细小的空间，他很快忘了这点点空隙因为John已经飞快地干着他，一手按在他腰上不让他动，硬是让他乖乖地吞进John的全部，另一手则把两根手指插进Sherlock口中，让他饥渴地吸吮。“John，John，John！”A    即使被John按着，Sherlock的身体和沙发也因他深入的操干而不住摇晃。John往里狠撞，重重地咬着Sherlock的肩膀，那突如其来的痛让Sherlock眼睛一黑，射得沙发一片狼藉。高潮时他的大脑成为空白，等到重新整理运作，他发现John也已经和他一起射了，而且自己嘴里还咬着John的手指。A    “对不起。”Sherlock立刻放开他的手指，满脸通红地说。以前做的时候他可没这么失神。他握住John的手指拉到眼前仔细检查：被Sherlock的唾液浸湿，皮肤上还有齿痕，幸好没有咬破。Sherlock喜欢自己的齿痕留在John皮肤上。这就像宣告全世界John是属于Sherlock的，是任何人一看即知，比脖子上的吻痕还要令他有满足感的东西，谁叫Sherlock喜欢炫耀吻痕John却坚持遮住他的那一部分。现在是夏天，John没法戴手套挡住，不然就太蠢了。A    Sherlock伸出舌头舔过那些痕迹。他品尝John皮肤的纹理，反复舔舐着牙齿咬出来的凹痕直到自己心满意足。因为太投入，他甚至忘记John还插在他体内，最后就听见John的咳嗽。A    “对不起。”Sherlock又说，这次还有些羞赧。他让John拔了出去，起身往浴室走；Sherlock自己则翻身趴下，累得连沙发上那块精液弄湿的地方都懒得去管（Mrs.Hudson会杀了他们的）。他把舌头舔过下唇才意识到已经把那儿咬出了血，John回来了，无奈地摇着头把Sherlock和沙发上的痕迹尽可能清理干净，还掰开他的臀瓣检查了内部。Sherlock挑逗地扭着腰，被John轻轻地拍打一下，情不自禁地嘤咛着。A    “脑袋感觉好点没？”John问。Sherlock空出一点沙发给他，翻了个身仰躺着，头枕在John的大腿上。John哀叫起来：“你要把整个沙发弄脏吗。”A    Sherlock不理他。他拉起John的手放进头发上，和自己的手一起磨蹭。John明白他的暗示，开始抚摸他那头卷毛，结果Sherlock又把John被咬过的手拉到嘴边含进去，继续舔那咬痕。A    “你是真的很喜欢这样。”John惊叹着。Sherlock不回答，连他的视线也回避着。他的大脑已经不再被欲望蒙蔽了，开始会为刚才的行为举止感到屈辱。显然John还挺喜欢那样的，但万一Sherlock的爱好实在有点过头呢？A    “Sherlock，回答我。刚才你感觉好吗？”A    Sherlock点头。A    “还想再来吗？”A    Sherlock激烈地点头，用力吸吮John的手指。A    “你这要命的口欲滞留。”John又好气又好笑地说，把手指轻轻抽回去。“我们又不是小毛头了。为什么这么怕和我谈这个？”A    “你不想伤害我，但我喜欢性行为中的疼痛感，特别如果施加者是你。我担心自己的癖好会吓走你，让你恶心，远离。”Sherlock勉勉强强地回答。A    “我绝不会离开你的。”John说，深吸了口气，“我也想象过你那个样子，但不敢提，不知道你过去有没有这样的经验，或者根本就没兴趣呢？光是能被你喜欢上，我就觉得自己够走运了。”A    “很高兴我们的口味如此一致，但如果你觉得勉强，我也不是非要那样才能爽。”Sherlock说。A    “我也很高兴。”John说，轻吻他的嘴唇，“啊啊，你有一点说错了。”A    “嗯？哪方面？”A    “关于我伤害你的。”John放低声音说，“虽然我们没有正式谈过，但我一直在思考你背部和胸前的伤痕。我甚至想象着去追杀那些留下伤痕的人。想象是一方面，现实里，我只希望是留下痕迹的人是自己。我讨厌你身上有别人强加的东西。如果你愿意，我想把它们化为我的东西，因为你属于我。我知道，你喜欢性行为中略带一点疼痛感，我也知道这个要求包含的不仅仅是‘一点疼痛感’——”A    “好的，我愿意。”Sherlock立刻就回答了，“只想要你的痕迹留在身上。”A    “你还是再多想一想，”John摇着头，“我要求的可能过于多。”A    “不必。”Sherlock说着，思绪已经飞到John可能会给他怎样的痕迹这方面了，John会占有那些伤痕，因为John占有了Sherlock的全部。“你所有的希望都是我的希望。”A A A AEND,Your Skull ( In My

He just had a conversation with his old pal Mike Stamford and he was currently in a rather depressing mood. Seeing Mike brought up many memories of being a med student and having the ability to use those skills. Now, he was a 32-year old crippled man who was jobless and alone. John continued his way back to his crappy bedsit, dangerous thoughts growing in his mind.At the bedsit, John sat on his bed, a gun in his left hand and an almost empty bottle of whiskey in his right. The hand with the gun shook slightly, the tremor going through his whole left side. He took another gulp of the burning liquid. After ten minutes, John got up slowly and then placed the gun back in its drawer, and threw the now empty bottle away.*John woke up the next morning, with a terrible headache and a painfully empty stomach. He sluggishly made his way to the bathroom to find himself staring back at him through the mirror and the sight was not what he had expected. The man in the mirror was unpleasant-looking, with dark circles under his eyes, his skin paler than it’s ever been, and his cheekbones and chin were jutting dangerously out. His depression, anxiety, and nightmares were etched across his face. Before realization dawned on him, his stomach cramped and whatever was left in his stomach made its way up causing John to be sick into the sink. After a few dry heaves, John rinsed out his mouth and without a second glance at the mirror, he limped his way back to bed.*The second time John woke up it was almost seven at night. He stretched, his hangover nearly gone along with the headache, but his whole body ached and his stomach was still aching and empty. He reluctantly got out of bed and limped his way to the bathroom only to be greeted with the same sight of him from earlier. He took a deep breath; not wanting to accept this was his life he slowly prepared for a shower. It was in the shower that the realization on his finally dawned on him. He wanted to die. The scary, unsettling realization made him feel sick but the idea of ending his misery was enough for him to turn the shower off and slowly but effectively dry off and put on some cleaner clothes.After all that, John sat on the bed, his gun in his hand. He sat there, and after what must’ve been over 30 minutes, he let out a sob, throwing the gun aside and curling up, his body shaking as the tremors and the tears left his body. It wasn’t until his tears were all gone did he wipe his face and limped his way out of his bedsit, gun tucked in his waistband hidden by his jacket and on his way to Regents Park. He knew this was the thing he had to do. He didn’t feel alive and wanted it to end and believed doing it in a more peaceful setting would be better. And if he did it in the park, he would be found sooner than if he did it in his bedsit. The smell would probably cause alarm if he did it that way. John called a cab and entered it, giving the cabbie directions.It wasn’t until 20 minutes later did John realise the cabbie wasn’t taking him to the park. He knocked on the glass and spoke, his voice cracking.“Sir, I asked you to take me to Regents Park. We should’ve been there by now.”“Oh, don’t you worry sir, I’m taking you to exactly where you need to be.” The cabbie replied, pulling up in front of what appeared to be a school. John’s defenses went up, but he didn’t know what to do as the cabbie swiftly got out and opened John’s door, aiming a gun at him. “Come along now.” The cabbie ordered.John reluctantly followed the cabbie into the school. The cabbie remained silent and drifted behind John, the gun aimed in between his shoulders.“In here.” The cabbie broke the silence, and walked in front of John opening a door, still pointing the gun at John. John went into the dimly lit room and the cabbie followed behind leading them to sit face to face at one of the tables.“What do you want?” John asked, slowly but clearly.“I want to talk to you.”“Are you going to kill me?”“No, I’m not going to kill you. I’m going to talk to you, and then you’re going to kill yourself.”“Why would I do that?”“I can read people. You are in a depressive state and were on your way to the park to do just that: kill yourself. You probably have a small bottle of something deadly on you. Or a knife. Or were you going to jump off the bridge? Well, it doesn’t matter now. After our little chat, you’re going to kill yourself and those who know you will assume it’s because of the obvious: You’re so clearly depressed with life the only surprise will be why you took so long.”“Shut up.”The cabbie didn’t respond but pulled out two bottles, a pill in each. He placed them next to each other in front of them.“Choose.”“Choose what?”“I’m giving you a choice; you can choose a bottle and take the pill or you can get a bullet in between your eyes.” He lifted the gun. “Your choice.”“So one of these pills is the bad pill and the other is not?”“Very good. I didn’t think you were smart.”John gulped. The pills were identical as were the bottles.“And now here is the fun part,” The cabbie spoke again, startling John. “Whatever pill you choose, I take the other and we both take our medicine.” John looked at the cabbie and then at the gun and then did he realise he too had a gun. He gulped and carefully observed the cabbie and the way he held the gun. It was then rather clear to him that the cabbie’s gun wasn’t real. He knew a real gun when he saw one and he felt rather stupid for not noticing it first.“I’ll take the gun.”The cabbie blinked and a small smile formed on his face. He then, without any warning, pulled the trigger, a small flame appearing. John let out a shaky breath he wasn’t aware he was holding. The cabbie laughed quietly.“What’s so funny?”“Nothing. You’re just a lot smarter than you appear.”John didn’t find anything funny and so he stood up quickly, no longer under threat and pulled out the gun from his coat, aiming it at the cabbie. The cabbie’s face fell as John released the safety off.“You’re not that smart as you act like it.” John snapped back to him.John, his hands steady, held the gun at the cabbie, and pulled out his phone, dialing the police.                                    * * *Police had surrounded the school. John had just explained the incident to a curly haired female officer when noise and loud yelling came from behind. The cabbie was already detained and in the back of a police car and nearby where all the yelling was occurring, was the senior detective (John could not remember his name) being yelled at by a tall, skinny man in a long coat.“Don’t worry about that, Dr. Watson.” The female officer said while finishing up her notes. John just nodded, returning his attention back to the officer.“Okay, I think we are done here.” The officer spoke, looking up at John. “Here is my card if there is anything else you feel is significant and Scotland Yard has your contact info-“ She was caught off guard by the tall skinny man who invaded the space between the officer and John and began yelling, at who John didn’t know.“You are all imbeciles! Seriously! If you had listened to me in the first place none of this would’ve happened!” The tall man went on. And on. And on. John began growing impatient, wanting to ask the female officer if there was someone, a counselor of some sort, to talk to, but the tall man kept going on, causing officers, including the one John had talked to, pull annoyed faces and mutter words that John couldn’t hear. The tall man weaved his way through the crowd like a child who had too much sugar and bumped into John multiple times. After the fourth shove by the tall man, John lost his patience completely and snapped.“Look, sir, could you please,” He said politely but with his military tone, “shut up! These officers are trying to do their job and you getting in the way shouting at them isn’t going to get me where I need to go!”  He shouted, the tall man stopped in his tracks. The man turned towards John who was leaning heavily on his cane. The man’s eyes swept down John as if examining him and without hesitance began yelling his observations rather quickly.“You’re an army doctor, recently returned from either Afghanistan or Iraq. You were wounded but not in the leg but in the shoulder and yet you feel pain in your leg so it’s a psychosomatic limp you have which your therapists does not see. You are extremely depressed and have a hidden gun in your waistband underneath your coat and were on your way to kill yourself when you got into the ill-fated cab. You are suicidal but are not going to kill yourself any time soon now for an unknown reason, and you were just going to ask Sergeant Donavan for a recommendation of a counselor. Am I wrong?”John blinked, completely not expecting that and although he believed it to be impressive, was rather pissed off at the mention of the gun and with a rush of anger, he punched the tall man sending him to the ground. Before two officers could swarm in to detain John, he grasped the man off the ground by the lapels of his coat and whispered, “Just because that was impressive does not mean I am not going to hurt you.” The tall man looked surprised at the word “impressive”, but before he could respond, John shoved the man back to the ground as officers swiftly lead him away. * * *John sat in the office of the detective inspector – Lestrade – his hands handcuffed in front of him. After turning in his not so legal gun in he was detained and then sent to the DI’s office. It wasn’t long until the DI himself entered.“I would like to apologize on behalf of Sherlock Holmes-”“Who?”“The man you punched for us all.”“Oh…who is he?”“Oh, he’s just someone we consult with for certain cases. Apparently he knew the previous four victims were murdered and hadn’t committed suicide like we had thought and he was rather pissed to find that the case was solved before he could get to it.”“Oh.”“Look, Dr. Watson, although you did assault someone in front of numerous officers, and you did have a illegal weapon on you, given what happened and the whole situation, myself and the superintendent have agreed to let you go without charges.”“Oh, wow, thank you, sir.”“However, we are issuing you to attend mandatory therapy sessions by someone we’ve worked with before, given that you were suicidal and do currently suffer from PTSD.”John swallowed, embarrassed but understood and nodded in response.Lestrade than sat up and unlocked the handcuffs from John and lead him out of the building with the information for the future therapy sessions.“Good luck to you, Doctor.”“Yeah, thanks.” John replied with a small smile and made his way back to his bedsit. * * *Two Months laterJohn had tried. Honestly. He had gone to every session required twice a week and tried very hard. But he couldn’t. The unknown that was his future stressed him out beyond repair. The way his life was now was lonely, cold, and almost as if he were a zombie—not living, just taking up space. He had tried to find someone, someone to connect with. He had been denied by every soul he went up to in bars and in coffee shops.It was probably the cane. He thought.He took another sip of beer and glanced downward at the empty street. He then looked up at the sky, which was slowly turning from dark blue to early morning gray as the sun rose. He had booked a hotel room on the 8th floor of the St. Reagents Hotel last night without any overnight bag. He finished the beer and tossed the can onto the balcony. He was perched on the ledge, his feet dangling below him. The patio door was closed (but not locked) so he didn’t hear the front door opening.  * * *Sherlock Holmes was bored. He was on a case, but a rather boring one. He had nothing else to do and so that’s how he found himself undercover as part of the cleaning service of some hotel. But to prove the crime-simple money laundering-he had to actually clean rooms. He pouted silently as he made his way from room 800 to 805, the next room on his list of checked out rooms. He knocked first, had learned that mistake of not knocking in room 609, and waited. There was no sound so he assumed the guest had gone down to an early breakfast. He unlocked the door and made his way in.The room was exactly has it been before the guest had checked in. Sherlock looked around the room and there was almost nothing revealing that someone had checked out this room. Almost. There was an imprint of a body on the bed although the bed was fully and professionally made which indicated the person might’ve been to tired to actually get into bed. That possibility disappeared from his mind when his eyes fell on the figure outside on the balcony, not standing, but sitting on the ledge. Sherlock was caught off guard and for longer than he would admit, his brain froze. He had no idea what to do. He looked around and found nothing else relating to the man apart from what was clearly a suicide note on the small table in the corner. After he regained his senses, Sherlock pulled out his phone and sent a text to Lestrade.Possible Suicide about to take place at St. Reagent’s Hotel, room 805. Man on ledge. Send help.SHSherlock then made his way slowly and logically, knocked softly on the balcony door. The man flinched at the noise, his hands tightening their hold on the ledge. He sat up straighter and glanced behind his shoulder but didn’t object. Sherlock opened the door slowly. The man on the ledge didn’t ease at the intrusion but remained silent, not aggressive or in fear.The two men remained where they where. Sherlock had no idea what to say and spent a considerable amount of seconds determining the best course of action. Finally he spoke, softly and in no way pitiful, “ It’s a bit cold to be outside, isn’t?”            The man, clearly surprised at the relaxed tone Sherlock was using, didn’t answer right away. He let out a shaky breath and when Sherlock thought he would answer, he didn’t.            “Maybe you want to come inside..?”            “No, thank you, I’m fine….right here.” The man said, in a defensive tone.            “You’re on the edge of the balcony…” Sherlock said, annoyed that he stated the obvious.                        “Clearly.” The man responded.Sherlock didn’t know what the right thing was to say and that annoyed him.            “…Do you want to tell me your name?”            “Look, can you just go please? I’m fine on my own and I don’t need your help or your comfort so please just fuck off.” The man snapped.            “Well, obviously you are not fine on your own since you are sitting in the edge of a balcony with eighty feet below you.” Sherlock snapped back. “And I am not going anywhere, not until the police arrive with the actual help.”            “You…you called the police!?”            “Of course. A man about to kill himself in public ought to have known somebody might call the police. Though you hoped that wouldn’t happen since you timed this to happen in the early morning. You just forgot about the cleaning service.”            “…How did you know that I timed it?”            “Obvious. The guest list says you checked in around 10 pm last night and from the evidence in the room you didn’t bring any possessions apart from the clothes on your back and your cane. You didn’t even bring your cell phone. You clearly put a lot of thought in this suicide with your ID and note on the table in clear view. The only question is…why?”            “Wow…that was amazing…”            “Really?” Sherlock said, surprised at the praise.            “Yeah…” The man said quietly, apparently in thought. “That was really…impressive….um….have we met before? Those deductions…your voice…its all sort of familiar…”                        “I doubt we have.”                                   “Why, because I’m so forgettable?” The man spat out.            Sherlock held back his response. He noticed the man was clearly agitated and so Sherlock held back his cold response and decided to say something safer.            “Maybe…you saw me on the television. I’m…” Sherlock then thought to hell with the case. “I’m not actually part of the cleaning crew here. I’m undercover…maybe you saw me in the paper or something…like that.”            “No…I know your voice. And those things you noticed…that was like…” And it finally dawned on the man. “Do you work with the police?”            “Sort of.”            “Were you at that school where that cabbie was caught two months ago?”            Sherlock was confused by answered, “Yes, I was…”            “You…” the man let out a laugh, catching Sherlock once again off guard. “You were that loud man that I…” The man didn’t finish as sirens began blaring, appearing closer and before he knew it, there were almost half a dozen emergency vehicles down below including an ambulance.            Sherlock, clearly noticing the man tense up at the arrival of the emergency vehicles, began speaking a bit urgently.            “Yes, I was there, and you were too. What were you doing there?”            “I…I had punched you.”            And at that, Sherlock remembered this man. He couldn’t remember his name but he remembered him, the man who had surprised him not with the punch but the words that were said to him after the punch: “…that was impressive…”“You thought what I did was impressive.” Sherlock stated, in shock and annoyed slightly at himself for not remembering that interesting man.“Yeah…yeah I did…it was…fuck…you were so arrogant but so right.” The man said, looking up at the sky, trying to blink back his tears.. “Shit, I’m sorry.”“You have nothing to apologize for.” Sherlock said. “I...I never apologize but I think I should…I’m sorry for what I had said…I probably got you into trouble with the whole gun thing…didn’t I?                                                “Sort of…yeah you did…I was required to take therapy twice a week…”“But?”“But?”“Well, clearly the therapy didn’t work,” Sherlock pointed out.The man let out a soft laugh. “No it didn’t...and I honestly can’t tell you why I’m here…I just feel so...alone.” The man finished, giving up on holding back his tears.“Well….maybe you just need a friend.”“They’re all dead…or overseas.”“A new friend?”“Who would want to be my friend? I’m not interesting…or impressive like you”“You’re interesting to me.”That caught the man off guard for a second. “Wha-why? Why am I interesting to you?” The man let out quickly.            “I’m embarrassed and annoyed that I didn’t recognize you as that man who punched me two months ago but I think that’s because you hide him. You keep that strong, military side of yourself hidden…not on purpose but because you think that that man you are isn’t needed…but I could use a friend like that…I don’t have any friends either.            The man didn’t know what to say but turned slightly to look at Sherlock for the first time. Their eyes met but neither of them moving. The man was breathing slightly uneven, his eyes glistening and tears falling down his face. The man gulped but didn’t move. Sherlock took this opportunity to ask,                        “Do you want to get down from there now?”                       The man didn’t respond, his breathing hitching as more tears fell from his eyes but he nodded, slowly reaching out to Sherlock. At that Sherlock swiftly sprung forward, seizing the man and taking him down off the ledge and onto the balcony floor. Noise erupted from the ground but Sherlock paid no attention. He held the man in his arms as the man continued on crying and shaking all over from the cold. Sherlock remained where he was until the man’s shaking subsided and the tears stopped; all that was left was the man trying to catch his breath. He then slowly stood up, the man still clutching him in a sideways hug and Sherlock half carried the man into the room and sat him down on the bed.Paramedics and some officers had made their way into the room already. A paramedic came up to the man and Sherlock placed a blanket over them. Sherlock was grateful, as was the man, that no one was trying to pry them apart for both these men needed someone, and now seemed to have found that person. 3 hours later Sherlock Holmes was sitting in the waiting room of Bart’s Hospital as the man, John Watson was his name, was being evaluated. He had been waiting for almost an hour and hoped he would get to see John. He was worried about what this meant for them because there was something he couldn’t understand that he had with the man and he wanted to see what that something was. A doctor walked towards Sherlock, who immediately stood up. The doctor went on explaining John’s condition and how he would be transported to a rehab facility and he was in no condition at the moment to been seen by anyone other than immediate family. Sherlock let out a noise of annoyance but understood and went to set up a visitation time with John.-----            John was lying in a bed after being questioned for nearly an hour. He was being admitted to stay overnight at the hospital and was required to be admitted into a rehab hospital that dealt with people like him for at least a month. After that he had no idea where he was going. And that was frightening him. That man who helped him down off the ledge, Sherlock was his name had seemed earnest in being friends and John, although he wouldn’t admit it out loud, was really looking forward to that.* * *One day laterJohn was currently lying on his bed in the small room provided for him by the rehab center. He had been for the past 3 hours since arriving and his future being in the rehab center currently resigned in his mind and that depressed him even more. He was given a full schedule of therapy sessions, leisure time, activities, and chores he was required to do and although he appreciated that he wouldn’t have spare time to let his thoughts get to him, he was afraid—afraid of something he couldn’t quite put a name too.There was then a knock at the door, which startled him out of his thoughts, and he slowly got up, grabbing his cane and then made his way to the door. There was no peek hole so he couldn’t be prepared for whom he saw after opening the door.            It was Sherlock Holmes, the man that talked him off the ledge. John had convinced himself that the man had just said what he had to in order to get him off the ledge and didn’t actually want to become friends. He had convinced himself that after he had even gotten over it after a pathetic breakdown the night before.            And yet, here Sherlock Holmes was, standing right in front of him, with an expression somewhere between amusement, curiosity, and worry.            “John Watson, was it? Aren’t you going to let me in?” He said.            “Oh…right, yeah. Sorry-”                       “No need to apologize. You clearly were convinced that I had made everything up, that I didn’t mean what I told you when you…were on the ledge.” He said, glancing around the room and then taking a seat at the small table.            John didn’t know what to say=here was this (gorgeous) man who actually wanted to be friends? John didn’t know and was afraid to find out. Maybe the man was just here to accept a thank you…or something. Thoughts like that began entering John’s mind and he shook his head, a habit he developed before he had gone to the hotel, to clear out those hazardous thoughts that led to him to that balcony.                        “Are…you okay?” Sherlock asked, bringing John back out from his mind.He blushed, embarrassed to have forgotten there was an actual person here.            “Sorry-“            “You don’t need to apologize John.”            “I’m s—…I…” he gulped; he hadn’t really interacted with anyone in a while and the connection he and Sherlock had was…a unique one.Sherlock didn’t say anything, but offered up what John thought was his attempt at a comforting expression. John gulped again.“I…I should…I…fuck…just...mmm…thank you…for doing what you did.” He finally said, his cheeks heating, no doubt very red now. He kept his gaze on the floor.Sherlock didn’t speak at first, but then softly responded.“You’re welcome. I admit I’m not very good with interacting with people but I felt I at least should see how you were doing.Silence infiltrated the room and neither one of them moved. John had already sat down in front of Sherlock so his leg wasn’t in any pain and he kept his gaze focused on the floor. The silence wasn’t awkward as it could have been, but there was some tension in the air John was too afraid to question. Luckily for him, Sherlock hated the feeling of unease.“Do you want to be friends?” He asked suddenly, causing John to suddenly shift his gaze up at Sherlock. “Because I was honest when I said I didn’t have any and thought we…” He stopped.“I…yes…I do, I really do…” John responded, the tension suddenly disappearing. “I have to admit I was…uh afraid…that you didn’t want…to…”“I do.” Sherlock said, his tone comforting, his expression gentle.            Although the tension had left the room, John had one question for Sherlock that would allow John to not worry about his future.            “Why?”Sherlock was caught off guard and it was evident on his face, which told John to elaborate.“Why…do you want to be friends?”“Oh well I find you interesting…which is rather rare. And I also…I feel this need to make sure you’re okay. We’ve met twice and I think…well my mother told me it must be fate but I don’t believe in that.“You told your mother about me?” John asked, rather amused.“I…” Sherlock eyes grew ever so slightly, aware now at what he just told John. “I did…what do you suppose you could make of that?”“You tell me.” John said, his voice not soft anymore, but confident which was striking to Sherlock. Sherlock looked into John’s eyes and saw a slight glint of amusement...and something else that Sherlock was not used to seeing. Without thinking of the possible consequences, Sherlock blurted out, with a slight smirk etched on his face,            “Are you flirting with me?”            John’s smile, which had only begun growing, faltered slightly, the gleam in his eyes dissipating. He tried to recover from that abrupt question but Sherlock caught his shift in emotion and realised what he had asked must’ve sounded harsher than he meant and so he quickly recuperated.            “I mean…I don’t know whether or not you’re flirting and I would like to know if you are so that…I could…flirt back.” Sherlock said, his eyes skittering across John’s face, to the floor, and back.            John’s smile grew slightly at that reassurance, and shyly looked at Sherlock, who smiled back.            The two men continued talking until a nurse came to tell Sherlock visiting hours were now over and he could come back next Saturday to visit. Sherlock was reluctant to leave John, but John reassured him he would be fine and he looked forward to his next visit. And with that Sherlock left John, both men looking forward to a much brighter future.*  *   *                Epilogue, two months later            John easily made his way down the stairs to the lobby of the rehab hospital, his bag in tow. Although he was feeling unease in the pit of his stomach, he knew it was just nerves. His mind then shifted from his nerves to Sherlock, who was standing near the front desk.            “Hello.” John greeted him, a smile forming on his face.            “Hello.” Sherlock responded, eyes roaming across John’s features, taking everything in. Though they had just seen each other last Saturday, Sherlock could now see even more on how John’s improved within the last two months. He still looked tired, but the gleam in his eyes was alive and never fading, the laugh lines around his eyes and mouth ever so noticeable. Sherlock was brought out of his mind from the feeling of John’s hand pressed in his and he looked down at their conjoined hands and then back up at John.            “Ready to go?” John asked.            “Oh, God yes.” ",Meant To Be,5042

Wine, chocolate and another female’s perspective spells the perfect recipe for a girls’ night in.","AMartha wasn’t feeling social.  She had happily spent the last two days in seclusion, but on a whim she turned her mobile back on and Molly’s was the first voice she had heard since John walked out.A“That bad?” she asked.AA“Worse than you can imagine,” Molly answered.AAMartha doubted that very seriously, but she conceded.  “Alright,” she said, doing her best to sound like herself.  Molly sounded like she was a wreck, so one of them needed to be strong.  “Heartbreak remedy number two?”AA“How about number eleven?”AAMartha cracked a smile at that.  “I thought that was a last resort?”AA“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” Molly replied.AA“So you’d have to be desperate to marry me then?”AA“No,” Molly insisted with a laugh.  “I’d be lucky!  Unfortunately, you’re already promised to another.”AAMartha didn’t immediately comment.  She wanted to blurt out everything that had happened with John, but she held it in instead.  “Heartbreak remedy number nine,” she told her.  “Go get your stuff.  I’ll ring the others.”AA“You’re a godsend,” Molly told her before hanging up.AAMartha would disagree, but she didn’t want to ruin one of the only healthy relationships she had going at the moment.AAAn hour later, she had tidied the flat and showered.  She was dressed in her pyjamas with several bottles of wine and snacks gathered for their sleepover.  Molly was the first to arrive and she hugged her so tightly that Martha thought her ribs might bruise.  Joan came next then Divya soon after.  Tish was the last one to show up.  When she entered the room, she looked from face to face.  “Which one of you screwed up this time?”AA“No one screwed up,” Joan replied defensively.AA“Since we’re talking screw ups,” Divya approached Tish with her hands on her hips.  “What were you thinking about talking Jeremiah into buying this ring?”AA“I was thinking it was gorgeous,” Tish answered, taking Divya’s hand and admiring the shiny bauble.AA“It’s too extravagant,” Divya protested.  “I might as well be wearing a car on my finger.”AA“Stop being so dramatic, it not like was the price of a Ferrari or a Porsche.”  Tish dropped her hand.  “At most it’s a Fiat.”AADivya exhaled sharply.  “Can you do something about your sister?” she asked Martha.AA“Not for over thirty years,” Martha retorted before popping a hunk of dark chocolate into her mouth.AA“So what’s this sleepover about?” Tish asked as she removed her coat.AAMolly looked like she was practically ready to burst at that point, so she did.  “I slept with Sherlock,” she blurted out.  As soon as she said the words, she began to panic.  She didn’t want to deliver the news in that way, but she was feeling a bit desperate and the delayed responses from her friends weren’t encouraging.  Perhaps she rendered them speechless.AATish’s eyes went wide.  “What?!  Again?”AAJoan lowered her wine glass with a frown.  “Again?”AA“No, AmyA Sherlock,” Molly clarified.AA“Oh thank God!” Tish exhaled.AA“You slept with AmyA Sherlock before?” Joan asked.AAMolly nodded sheepishly.  “It was just the one time and you and John had just gotten back together so I didn’t want to bother you about it.”AA“It’s no bother,” Joan assured her.  “In fact, it explains a lot about both of the Sherlocks' recent behaviour.  I’m just surprised none of you ever said.”AA“More importantly, why do you care so much?” Divya asked Tish suspiciously.AATish scoffed softly and poured herself a glass of wine.  “I don’t care.”AA“No, she’s right.  When Molly said it was her Sherlock you looked totally relieved,” Joan pointed out.AA“Oh, Tish.”  Martha groaned softly.  “You didn’t.”AA“Well…”  Tish bit her bottom lip.AAMolly gasped.  “You didn’t!”AA“Look at her, she definitely did,” Divya insisted.AATish nodded.  “I did.”AA“Okay, I’m just going to throw this out there,” Joan said.  “Are there any of my friends that Sherlock Ahasn’tA slept with?”AAMartha’s hand immediately went up and Divya replied, “I haven’t either.”AA“Well you slept with someone,” Tish said.AA“What?” Joan looked at Divya.AA“Div!”  Molly looked at her seriously.  “Why didn’t you tell us?”AA“Because it only just happened,” Divya answered.AA“Well who was it?” Molly pressed.AA“No one.”AA“His name is Rafa.  He’s fit, Argentinean and AbeyondA gorgeous,” Tish answered for her.AADivya cut her eyes at Tish.  “We’re supposed to be talking about Molly and Sherlock.”AA“Okay then.  I have a question.”  Tish sat down next to Molly on the couch.  “Is one better than the other?”AA“Please don’t answer that,” Joan groaned into her wine.AATish nudged Molly.  “Just give me a tiny hint.”AA“Letitia!” Martha wailed as she dropped her head back against her chair.AA“Fine.”  Tish rolled her eyes.  “Can you at least give us the details?”AA“It just happened.”  Molly shrugged.  “He was being nicer than usual and one thing lead to another.”AA“So what’s the problem?” Divya asked.  “Wasn’t it everything you were hoping it would be?”AA“Was he bad?”  Tish frowned.  “I mean honestly he looks a bit stiff.”AA“He wasn’t stiff!” Molly retorted fiercelyAA“That came about quickly, didn’t it?” Tish replied.AA“The sex was…perfect,” Molly sighed wistfully then frowned.  “It was the part after that wasn’t so good.”AAMartha exhaled sharply.  “What did he say this time?”AAMolly looked at her.  “He brought up his brother…our one night stand.”AA“You aren’t suggesting that he had sex with you because he was competing with Sherlock, are you?” Joan questioned.AA“I don’t know,” Molly answered softly.  “Maybe?”AA“Molly, you know better than anyone that Sherlock isn’t my favourite person,” Martha told her seriously.  “But even I don’t think he’s AthatA cruel.”AA“I know,” Molly conceded with a sigh and drank more of her wine.  “I just don’t understand.  Everything was so perfect, but he went and ruined it!  I mean how can one man be so…so…”AA“Disrespectful?” Martha suggested.  “Infuriating?”AA“Tactless,” Joan offered.AA“Rude,” Divya supplied.AA“Judgemental,” Tish chimed in.AAMolly pursed her lips at the abundance of adjectives at her disposal.  “All of the above.”AA“Molly, I say this with love, because honestly you’re like my other sister,” Tish began.  “But you really do have bad taste in men.”AAMolly scoffed softly.  “What?”AA“Do you remember Creepy Owen?” Divya asked.AA“Creepy Owen?”  Joan questioned.AA“This bloke we were at university with,” Martha explained.AA“Who Molly had the misfortune of fancying,” Divya added.AAMolly shrugged.  “He wasn’t so bad.”AA“He always seemed to me to be the type that might slip something in a person’s drink when they weren’t looking,” Divya insisted.AA“Wait.  Do you mean Owen Harper?” Tish asked.AAMartha looked at her sister with a sigh.  “Please tell me you didn’t shag Owen too.”AA“What?”  Tish met her glance with a shrug.  “He was fun and he fancied me.”AA“He fancied everyone,” Martha retorted.AA“Not everyone,” Molly recalled.  “But he was certainly mad for you.”AA“Flirty doctors with a thing for Martha,” Divya said with a laugh.  “I reckon he and John Smith could start a club.”AA“And Tom, of course,” Joan agreed with a grin.AA“We need more wine,” Martha announced suddenly and headed off to the kitchen.  She exhaled sharply and stood in front of the refrigerator, not bothering to open it and grab another chilled bottle of Muscat.  Before she could help herself, she felt tears forming at the corners of her eyes.  A moment later, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her waist followed by Molly’s voice.AA“You miss him, don’t you?” Molly asked.  Martha didn’t answer because a small part of her questioned if she meant Tom or John.  “He’ll be back.  I mean how could he stay away?”AA“But what’s he coming home to?” Martha cried softly.AA“What?”  Molly turned her around to face her.  “Martha, why are you crying?  What’s going on?”AA“I did something so incredibly stupid, Molly.”  Tears began to freely stream down her face and Molly wiped them away with the sleeves of her pyjamas.AA“Come on, love.  It can’t be that bad,” Molly reasoned.  “It’s not like you’re me and had sex only to regret it afterwards,” she joked.AAMartha bit her bottom lip into submission to kept herself from revealing that she had done exactly that.  If Martha could talk to anyone about this it was Molly.  She was her best mate and practically her sister.  She would understand and even if she didn’t she wouldn’t judge her.  All she had to do was tell her the truth.AA“You right,” Martha said after a quiet moment.  “It’s nothing.”  She forced a smile.  “I just really miss Tom.”",Heartbreak Remedy No. 9,1440

He got to wear his brand new jumper his mother would knit him every year for the occasion. He would complain to his mates that of course he was too old now for motherly doting but he secretly relished the fact that they always smelled like her when he first got them, and she would always say that it was like a hug from her every time he wore it. It was a sentiment that he'd never be rid of, even when he pulled on a store bought one. There was an accompanying crisp new button up to go with it. This one was a deep blue, the buttons a cloudy pearl colour. The jumper was the same hue as plain porridge. Both of his tops served to bring out his eyes, she told him. His eyes were just like his Da's, she would say and then hers would get sad and John would let her hug him so she would stop crying.AA AAThere were flyovers and gun salutes and men and women in smart uniforms milling about the fielded area, basking in the unusually warm and sunny November Sunday. He practiced his salute in the mirror often and got a thrill every time it was returned. There were other children about, not counting his little sister who clutched Mum's hand the whole time. Harriet, who had at first been very loud and demanding, suddenly became an anxious little thing two year prior.AA AAAs John was handing out his messenger bag full of poppies as he'd been charged with doing, he heard a noise that was slightly off. His Da had taught him to pay attention to his environment, to listen first because eyes failed more than ears. When he found the source of what he'd heard, it just looked like a few lads, some probably around his age and some older, standing around talking. But the location was strange, around the side of the brick walls that housed the park's public loos. There was one rather high-pitched voice that didn't seem to belong to any of them, but was present all the same. He made his way toward that direction, smiling and saluting and shaking hands, all the while keeping his eye on whatever was going on over there. As he drew closer he saw flashes of coin, either changing hands or just held in them. He could also hear better what was being said.AA AA""Your father is a pilot,"" the littler voice was saying.AA AA""Everyone knows that!"" snapped a ginger kid. AA AA""Yes but he somehow doesn't do well on pilot simulation console games."" He'd had to give up one of his coins to what John could now see was a tiny boy with a mass of lazy black curls on his head. He wore a bespoke suit, leaning against the wall in a way that made John flinch a bit about what state the back of his jacket must be in. The boy didn't seem worried about it at all as he casually made what seemed like predictions or something about the boys surrounding him. John didn't like the look of the situation but, again, the boy didn't seem to actually care as he spouted what seemed to be facts the way he delivered them.AA AAASeven boys. Two around my age, the rest older. Perhaps even teen-agers. My age ones casual, teens standing a bit too close and speaking as if they're almost angry. Hightened threat level.AAAA AAAThe younger boys left the gathering because they were apparently out of money. The older ones began asking more probing questions until finally, it became exactly what John was afraid it would.AA AA""Is Nigel here gay for Corey?"" They all snickered and Nigel, a caramel-skinned boy with tight black curls cut close to his head laughed with them.AA AA""Oi! I ain't a poof!""AA AA""Actually,"" said the little voice, a bit of a lisp rendering his speech pretty endearing, ""You want to kiss Christopher the way that parents kiss each other but you won't tell anybody."" The group, rowdy and laughing a moment ago went dead silent as they all stared at the child over whom they loomed.AA AA""I ain't a bloody shirt-lifter, Nigel."" John had to assume that was Christopher.AA AA""I ain't either,"" Nigel protested. ""You shut up, Sherlock Holmes!"" What sort of name was that?AA AA""Yeah piss off!""AA AA""When people fancy each other,"" Sherlock said, doing the exact opposite of shutting up but, in a way pissing him off, ""their pupils get really wide even in a lot of light where they would normally get smaller, and they breathe a bit faster. Sometimes it's the same as being angry but Christopher is your friend, Nigel, and you didn't seem angry with him when I observed those traits.""AA AAAt this point, John started running.AA AAHe closed the distance just as Nigel shoved the child into the gravel, obliterating the knees of his nice trousers. This Sherlock(really, though, what kind of a name is Sherlock?)didn't even cry out. He teared up a bit, only visible because a bit of sunlight glinted off of the water in his eyes. With a left hook his Da always mentioned he was proud of teaching him despite Mum's instruction to the contrary, Nigel was on his own knees, in a similar position as Sherlock, nose pouring blood.AA AA""Have you nothing better to do than push around a little kid?"" John asked, eyes squinting dangerously, both hands fisted at his sides, body firmly planted between the little one and the others, ready to go again on a moment's notice.AA AA""What're you going to do about it, half pint?"" John was on the smaller side of boys his age, he knew. Even seven year-old Harriet was nearly his height. But what he lacked in height and girth, he made up for with balls of steel. He didn't even flinch when Christopher made as if he was going to launch himself at him. This show of courage apparently angered the object of Nigel's affection. Two of the other three had fled when Nigel was taken down. Christopher then actually did have a go, and with a left, two quick rights, and a shove, the remaining boys were encouraged to vacate the premises. John waited until they were far enough away for his liking before turning to the child, hugging his knobby scraped knees and sniffing for all he was worth, as if his eyes would suck the tears that had already fallen back in. AA AA""Alright?"" John asked, eyes running over the crimson oozing from the child's knees but not touching them yet. Something about this little one's stature said stay back, so John obliged at first until he could get a better idea.AA AA""I'm fine,"" Sherlock said, his voice hitching in a heart-breaking manner.AA AA""Mind if I take a look at your knees? I have a medi-kit in my satchel here."" The boy examined him with eyes that were mostly green, but flecked with blue and grey and even gold. Somehow that pale gaze was extracting his life force a tiny bit at a time. ""I have cool plasters,"" he offered, needing to say something.AA AA""What ones do you have?""AA AASherlock flinched a bit as John diligently cleaned his wounds, tears rolling down pale cheeks yet there was zero sniveling. John spoke soothing words about what a brave little lad he was, taking a page form his mother's book on soothing children, then asking him questions such as his age(six)and if his name really was Sherlock.AA AA""It's what I like to be called,"" the boy said, sniffing as if it was disdain instead of discomfort.AA AA""Yeah but is it actually your name?""AA AA""One of them,"" he replied truthfully.AA AA""I'm John. John Watson.""AA AA""Sherlock Holmes. You're missing a button. Probably popped off when you were fighting."" John's brain went on high alert as he searched the ground after confirming the statement.AA AA""Oh no! Mum'll have my guts for garters. This is a brand new shirt-"" Just then, rather thin pale fingers reached toward his now exposed throat. They extracted the chain, examined the round metal disks. It made John go still. He didn't normally let anyone touch his Da's dog tags, especially strangers. But this kid was proving himself different in so many ways. Also he was practically a baby and babies could get away with more. AA AA""Are you going to be a soldier too, John?"" John looked at this odd creature with his odd name as he seemed fascinated by the dog tags. He then shrugged. AA AA""Yeah. And a doctor. That's why I always carry a little medi-kit with me. Have to be prepared out in the field."" He silently offered Sherlock his choice of plasters with little cartoon characters on them. Sherlock, just as silently chose the one covered in bees. ""Mum got upset when I told her I wanted to go into the Army when I was old enough. She says to me, 'You should be a doctor,' she says. I went on the internet at school and found out I could do both. But when I told her she only said, 'That's nice' in the way that means she doesn't really believe me.""AA AAJohn smoothed the plasters over the bony knees before dropping a healing kiss on each one without even thinking about it. He couldn't do that in the Army. But again this was a little kid. The thought of kissing war wounds made him giggle a little bit. Sherlock gave him a puzzled look but asked the unexpected question, ""Why do you wear your father's dog tags?""AA AA""Protection,"" came the automatic answer. It's what his Da did, protect people. He sat next to Sherlock in a similar position, knees up, back against the cool brick wall.AA AA""If you have them, that means he's dead so they didn't do a very good job of protecting him, did they?"" Sherlock said bluntly, picking at the little rocks nonchalantly as he tore at John's heart.AA AA""They did protect him,"" John said, trying to control his temper as he was taught. ""He didn't feel any pain. It was instant. And he died protecting people by throwing himself on that bomb and now, he protects us from Heaven.""  AA AA""There's no such thing as Heaven."" John was on his feet before he knew it.AA AA""There is too! And my Da's there protecting me because I got into a lot of bad accidents and was really sick a few times and doctors said one of those things should have killed me but I didn't die because my Da protected me!"" He felt his face grow hot and his breathing laboured. This...  baby knew nothing! Not about stuff that mattered, anyways. Being gay or straight didn't matter as far as John knew and neither did who did what job in the military as they were all serving a purpose greater than themselves, whatever that meant. All he knew was that his Da was practically Superman and this little squeaky mouse wasn't going to say anything different. He was seeing it now, what made people want to beat him up. But still he was a little kid. As all of these thoughts flashed through John's head, he watched Sherlock stand, wipe off his hands, then squat a bit laboriously due to his injured knees and pinch something off of the ground. At first John thought it a particularly shiny rock. But Sherlock held it out to him, little back straight, little nose up in the air.AA AA""I apologise, John. You do well at protecting and being a doctor. You protected me from those boys and put plasters on my knees. I think you'll be a brilliant Army Doctor.""AA AA""I... thanks.""AA AA""You're welcome. Here is your button."" Just like that, John was diffused. He actually wanted to hug this kid now. What just happened?AA AA""Cor! Great! How'd you find it?""AA AA""Simple maths. Trajectory and such.""AA AA""Do you even know how to spell 'trajectory'?""AA AA""Don't be ridiculous, John, of course I do."" There was a quiet between them, an easy camaraderie that probably didn't actually come easy with this child in general.AA AA""We should... get you back to your parents. They'll want to know what happened to your trousers.""AA AA""I suppose,"" the boy sighed, as if he was the most put-upon creature on earth.AA AA""Won't they be cross?""AA AA""A bit.  Until I do this."" Sherlock looked at John with widened his eyes so that every bit of colour could be seen. They filled, his full bottom lip trembling just enough to shake loose a couple of tears. John would have been totally convinced had he not been informed beforehand of the ruse. He shook his head and began walking toward the gathering.AA AA""Wow,"" John was saying, letting Sherlock catch up to him before moving to trail ever so slightly behind him, making sure there were no further bullying encounters planned. He was only a little surprised when Sherlock slid his hand easily into his as they strolled. He said nothing about it. In fact, he listened even more closely to Sherlock's rants about... what was it, his brother now? AA AA""You best bring me to my brother, first,"" Sherlock sighed again. ""Easier than dealing with my parents.""AA AA""You have a brother?""AA AA""You act like it's some great feat."" John rolled his eyes.AA AA""Which one is he?""AA AA""The fat one."" John scanned the crowd and saw only one group of people that may have fit the age range if not the appearance.AA AA""I don't see a-""AA AA""The one talking to the policewoman's son.""AA AA""The... police woman's-""AA AA""Ugh!"" Sherlock threw exasperated hands and expressions to the heavens. ""There! Right there!"" He pointed at the same group of boys John had been looking at the whole time. ""Grey suit, umbrella, talking to that black haired boy on the dirt bike he fancies.""AA AA""How do you know that?""AA AA""My brother's a homosexual."" The little lisping voice made the word sound almost obscene. But not quite since it didn't really matter. His Da's brother was a gay and really put out by it. Their part of the Watson family was the only one to accept his uncle readily when he came out.AA AA""Right."" He cleared his throat. ""Nothing wrong with that.""AA AA""No. Except for the fact that my brother would require a lorry for their first date if he can somehow talk that boy into it. That boy fancies both girls and boys.""AA AASherlock then proceeded to tell him how he could tell. John whistled low and smiled widely with a breathy, ""Fantastic!"" Sherlock stopped walking so John did too.AA   AA""Erm... what?""AA AA""That was amazing. Just extraordinary.""AA AA""That's not what people normally say.""AA AA""Why what do people normally say?""  AA AA""What you heard earlier. Piss off."" John nearly had to sit down for all of his laughter. He finally got it together enough to go on. Sherlock never let go of his hand. ""You lick your lips a lot,"" Sherlock mentioned.AA AA""Do I?""AA AA""Yes. And your nose twitches when you're about to punch somebody.""AA AA""Really?""AA AA""Uh-huh. And when you're really angry, you smile the tiniest bit. It's funny to see how terrified it makes people."" John wasn't sure how he felt about being laid bare by a six year old. ""By the way, your jumper is hideous.""AA AA""I like this jumper. My Mum made it for me.""AA AA""I could tell.""AA AA""Well we all can't be posh gits with expensive clothes we don't even care about, can we?""AA AASherlock shrugged shallowly.AA AA""And your brother is not actually fat,"" he added.AA AA""Then you should have an eye exam as you'll need much better vision to be a doctor.""AA AAJust then, the same assessing stare the little one had, came at him from the big one, tall and imposing.AA AA""Oh, Sherlock,"" he was chastised, halfway between exasperation and worry. John understood completely. ""What have you done to yourself? I can't bring you back to Mummy and Father in this state.""AA AA""I didn't do anything, Mycroft!"" What was up with these names? There was an eyebrow way too expertly cocked at Sherlock, even for a teen-ager. ""There were other children asking me questions for money if I got them right but then they got angry. But John Watson... protected me."" John wasn't sure if he should let go of the child's hand or not but Sherlock certainly showed no signs of releasing his.AA AA""Come along, Sherlock. You know I always keep spare clothes in the car."" Sherlock sighed an identical sigh to the one his brother gave when they first walked up. ""Apologies, Gregory. My brother is quite the handful.""AA AA""I see that,"" said the slightly older teen. He mussed Sherlock's hair earning himself a rather adorable sneer. ""Laters, Myc."" He continued to lean against his transportation with his straight black hair and large dark eyes and leather jacket. John saw the appeal. He was cool. AA AASherlock tugged at John's hand until he bent far enough at the knee to receive a surprising kiss on his cheek. The older boys all looked at each other but no one said a word and Sherlock acted as if nothing was amiss. Mycroft shook John's hand and acquired his home number as only his mother had a mobile.AA AA""Behave yourself, Sherlock,"" John warned.AA AA""Dull,"" droned the child before trailing reluctantly after his big brother.AAAAA ",Remembrance,2935

This was the day she’d been dreading since she was little. The inevitable day she’d be auctioned off as a prize to whomever could prove he was “the most worthy”. It was all too cliche for her tastes. Despite that fact, though, she added to it by vehemently loathing every last God-forsaken person that was in this competition.    As she watched with utter boredom she noted, to her dismay, that both younger princes from two nearby kingdoms had decided to join the competition. She knew both James and Sherlock all too well and wanted nothing to do with either of them. One of them would win. They were both clever and, more than that, they both wanted nothing more than to outdo the other. She groaned quietly and retreated to her seat on the platform.    Both men were from extraordinarily well-to-do nobility and would certainly mean a life of relative comfort and security. But to be forever trapped with someone she hated, she could barely stand the thought. She leaned on the arm of her chair, letting her hair drape loosely around her face.   She hardly noticed when a trumpet sounded to announce the start of the competition. It honestly didn’t interest her in the slightest. There were about ten men in total, and they were all going to attempt to prove themselves by some sort of contest? What was it? Archery? Jousting? She glanced down at the first two contenders. Fencing. Right. How manly. She scoffed, rolling her eyes.    One by one the participants were taken out of the competition until the final two were left standing. An announcement was made, revealing the two to be “Prince Holmes” and “Prince Moriarty.” That’s a surprise. I think I’m going to have a heart attack and die from that surprise. Molly faked a smile in the general direction of the two. Wouldn’t that be nice.    What did come as somewhat of a surprise, however, was how long the two of them managed to go on for without landing a single point until finally Sherlock managed one. “And here I thought this would be hard, Moriarty. I’m ashamed of you.” He raised an eyebrow and Jim raised a middle finger. The match went on for far too long and any slight interest Molly had had before was now entirely gone.    It wasn’t until both men had landed four points each and, to be as absolutely cliched as possible, this final round would determine the winner. She paid a bit more attention, figuring this round was actually the only one of any importance at all. She told herself that she didn’t care who won, but that was a lie. She knew the two boys well enough to know that for whatever reason Sherlock had joined this competition, it was undoubtedly for absurdly selfish reasons. Whereas it was slightly more likely that Jim was actually somewhat interested in her.   Finally the match ended. Sherlock had come out on top. Truth to tell, none of the three were happy with the outcome. Sherlock, himself, not rightly caring whether he’d just won a stuffed bear or a wife. He had only wanted to one up Moriarty in their petty feud, and knew this would be the perfect way to do so.    Molly begrudgingly walked down the steps that separated her from the man that had just won her and couldn’t care less. He wasn’t unattractive, that was at least a small perk. His cold and uncaring demeanour was what turned her off of him. She followed protocol and curtsied in front of him, holding back a sneer of disgust as he simply nodded, rather than returning the gesture with a bow.    She sighed, looking around to what few onlookers there were. She glanced past Sherlock to Jim who was mostly just glaring at the curly haired man. Looking back to her soon-to-be husband, she could only think one thing: fuck. A~~~A A   Molly gazed around the interior of the castle she’d been led into. Not by Sherlock, of course, heaven forbid he pay her any attention. But she did discover one perk about her newly acquired home: it was gorgeous. The architecture, the paintings, the view, everything. But she was still furious about it.   She’d been given a week from the wedding, as is customary, to move into her new home. Over the period of that week she’d only grown to hate Sherlock even more. He was cold, unwelcoming, and entirely disconnected. She doubted he even knew her name.    As she slowly boiled inside, one of the guards that was leading her around chatted away nonstop. She was fairly certain he was discussing which rooms were what and where they were. She did feel sorry she wasn’t paying attention, and was certain she’d regret it when she’d need to inevitably ask directions to the kitchen.    Suddenly the two guards stopped and turned to her. They gestured to the door on their left. “Sir spends most of his time in here. He’s requested we bring you here after completing your tour.” She glanced towards the door and then back to the two, sheepishly. They only stared back at her. She sighed and thanked them, though they probably should’ve taken better care to ensure she had been listening to their speech.    They walked away, leaving her standing alone in the hallway. Maybe I could just jump out that window… Oh, stop it. Stop it. You don’t really know him. Maybe he’s just one of those… tough shells. You can crack him. If anyone can, you can. It wasn’t the most persuasive pep talk, but it did the job.    She quietly knocked on the door and waited. No answer. She knocked again. Nothing. She sighed and knocked one last time with more force. Finally a murmured reply came from the other side. She shrugged and pushed the door open to find an absolute disaster.     There were papers strewn everywhere, only one chair out of about seven were actually upright, books littered the floor, and the only organized place was a small desk that looked as though it hadn’t been touched in years. In the middle of this mess sat a disheveled looking Sherlock Holmes. He was holding several papers and a book, along with half of an apple.   Good god. Molly picked her way into the room, taking care not to step on too many papers. “Sherlock?” She leaned towards him. “Sherlock are you all right?” He simply continued to mutter something about whatever was on those papers. She reached down and lightly touched his shoulder. He didn’t respond. “Sherlock?” She shook him a bit, resulting in a slight jump and a very agitated glare.    “What?” He demanded. “I’m busy.”    “Well, it’s just that I was told you wanted to see me?” She shifted uncomfortably.     He looked at her for a moment, studying. “Of course.” He said finally. “How much do you know about this?”     She grabbed the piece of paper he’d shoved at her and looked it over. The Houston-Davis Case. “I don’t understand. Why are you--”   “Of course you don’t understand.” He groaned, popping to his feet and snatching the paper away. “No one does. I don’t understand.”   “Why do you say it like--”   “What about this one?” He flung a paper at her. “Or this one?” He tossed another one. “What about all of these?!” He threw the rest of the papers he was holding into the air. “There’s nothing to connect these people, why are they all being killed the same exact way? 34 stab wounds and slice down the back. What does that even mean?!”    “Sherlock when was the last time you got any sleep?”   “Nine murders in two weeks.” He muttered, running both hands through his hair.    “I don’t understand.”    He turned to look at her, suddenly. He didn’t say anything, just stared. After about a minute of this she started to back away, uncomfortably when he sprang forward to grab her shoulders. “Molly, what happened two weeks ago?”   “Wha- I- please let me go.” She shrunk back, trying to escape.    “What happened two weeks ago?! Something important must’ve happened, what was it?”   “Well, the contest, but--”   He froze, still tightly gripping her shoulders and staring straight at her. She squirmed uncomfortably. Isn’t this romantic. At least three minutes passed in total silence before he finally broke it in the most anti-climactic way she could imagine.    “God damnit.” He muttered, peeling away from her. “Damnit.” He sat back down on the floor, recollecting the papers he’d flung everywhere.    Molly took a small step forward. “Did I--”   He held a finger to his lips as he went back to studying whatever those files were.    “Look, if you’re just going to keep acting weird I’m gonna leave…” She started slinking towards the door.    He looked up at her with a sort of fury in his eyes that glued her to the floor. “You’ll stay here.” He whispered harshly.    She was furious. “Who do you think you are?! You can’t--”    “Shut up!”   “I will not!” She argued as she watched him mess with his precious papers.    “Molly, honestly would you--”   “Would I what?” She demanded. He was staring at the papers, pale faced and looking somewhat like a frightened child. “Sherlock!”    He shot to his feet and grabbed her by the wrist. He slammed the door open and drug her out into the hallway, much against her will.    He was nearly a foot taller than she was and startlingly strong, she didn’t have much to fight back with. She tried anyway. After a good deal of playing tug-of-war with her arm Sherlock sharply turned a corner, yanked her up a flight of steps and into a nearly empty room where he finally released her arm.    “How dare you?! I am not just a ragdoll you can drag--” She was cut off as his hand clamped over her mouth.   “You don’t like me, and I know that.” He whispered. “But I need you to trust me. You’re not safe.”    She pried his hand away from her face. “What?”   “Just stay here. I’ll fix this.”   “No, what do you mean I’m not safe?”    “Just--”   “What do you mean?!” She backed away from him slowly.   He sighed. “The names. The names of the victims. Whoever is killing them is spelling something with the last initial.”    “How did you…?” He looked up at her curiously. “Right. Of course. You’re clever.” She rolled her eyes. “But what was it spelling?”    “‘Molly Holmes.’”A~~~A   Molly Holmes. Molly Holmes. Molly Holmes. She hated the sound of it. What do they even mean, Molly Holmes? Are they threatening to kill me or what? She leaned against a wall, bored to tears. She’d been stuck in this room for three days already. The only interaction she’d gotten was when Sherlock had someone send her some food and drink.    At least it seems he knows me well enough to lock the door. She shrugged and closed her eyes. Had it not been locked in at least three different ways and had a table or desk of some sort pressed against it she would’ve escaped long ago. She’d tried jumping out one of the windows, or she would have if it wasn’t a 100 foot drop. She was fast becoming furious with Sherlock for abandoning her here.    She was just about to mentally go on another rant about how much she hated him when a noise from the opposite end of the room caught her attention. Her eyes fluttered open and she gasped, pressing herself against the wall. Standing across from her was Moriarty himself. “What…?” She scrambled to her feet. So much for 100 feet.   “Surprised, Molly? You shouldn’t be.” He grinned, sauntering towards her.  “How did you--”  “None of your concern. Whatever you’re going to ask is none of your concern.” He shrugged, stopping about a foot away from her. “It’s a shame that Sherlock won that contest. I was just going to keep you for myself, but now all of these other people have died and that was just for show.”   “What are--”   “See, every time you begin a sentence with a question word, I’ve already tuned you out.” He waved his hand dismissively. “Now, my poor Mrs. Holmes--”   “Hooper.”   “Sure.” He rolled his eyes. “Now, I’m afraid your time is up.”   Her eyes widened and she did the only logical thing she could think to do: let out an ear piercing scream.    After her stunningly loud cry for help, Jim flipped a dagger into his hands and growled lowly. “Well, now look what you’ve gone and done. I’m going to have to kill whoever comes after you now too.”    What have I got? Anything? Nothing? Book? That’ll do. She yanked a book off of the desk next to her and held it defensively, only bringing a laugh from her soon-to-be killer.    “Oh, heaven’s no. Not literature!” He feigned fear, just long enough for Molly to take a swing at him, successfully ripping the knife out of his hands. She swung again, blindly, only to have him stop the book inches from his face and tear it away from her.    Typically it’d be unlike her to do anything overly brash or without thinking it through, but this was life or death. With no weapon and no defense she did what she could. She launched herself at Jim, succeeding in sending them both to the ground.    A moment later she was yanked to her feet by a very disheveled Moriarty. He grabbed her by the throat and pushed her against the window, trying to push her out. She couldn’t brace herself against the wall or the floor but she tried anyway. “You killed all those people!” She shouted.   “They aren’t the only ones. And I’ll gladly kill more!” His eyes registered fury, but also frightening amounts of madness. She paused to stare at him before quickly making a decision she knew she’d instantly regret. Though not for long. She wrapped her arms around him and tipped backwards, yanking them both out of the window.   She didn’t even have time to think before someone caught her by the ankle. The skirt of her dress fell over her face, and she couldn’t see who it was, but she knew anyway. She felt Jim latch onto her wrists and heard as he cursed a mile a minute at her. She shook her arms, but that did nothing. She was slowly registering that whoever was holding her was looking somewhere she’d rather they didn’t, but that wasn’t her main concern right now.    She twisted her wrists in Jim’s grasp. He was screaming at her but she couldn’t hear anyway. She was getting dizzy from being held upside down. Finally, with an aggressive yank she slipped her hands out of his grasp. What she did finally hear, was a sickening crunch as he hit the ground.    When she had been pulled back into the room and had readjusted her dress, she looked up as Sherlock, warily. He stared back, blankly, for a moment before gently grabbing her face in his hands and pulling her forward to meet his lips to hers. After a bit he pulled away and frantically looked her over muttering “Molly, oh Molly.”    Once he determined that she was fine he wrapped her in a tight hug for just a second before pulling away. “I had no idea… He’d scale a wall, just to kill you.”    “Why?” She whispered weakly.    “I never thought he’d be so desperate.”   “Why did he want to kill me?” She elaborated.    He stared at her for what felt like the millionth time. “He wanted you for himself. And if he couldn’t have you, no one could.”   “Wouldn’t that have been better though?!” She cried, sliding to the floor. “No one would be dead, no one would have died.”    Sherlock knelt in front of her. “Maybe not. But he was sick. You wouldn’t have been safe.”    “But no one would have died!”   “He’s killed before, Molly.” She looked up at him, wiping at her eyes with her sleeve. “And I certainly wouldn’t have been better off.”    “What?”   “I love you, Molly. I know you hate me. But I love you. I always have.” For once his stare wasn’t intense and demanding. It was soft and afraid, like a little lost child. That’s all he was: lost and afraid and he needed love. She leaned into him, holding him tightly. If that’s all he wanted, she certainly had enough to share.",Friendly Competition,2778

But that doesn’t make John any less worried.Right now, he’s very worried, indeed. Right in the middle of a drug’s bust, right as Lestrade is yelling at Sherlock while Sherlock is yelling at Anderson, with Sally Donovan sneering in the background and John desperately tapping away at the laptop, trying to find the killer, when suddenly, the location finally zeros in on…“Sherlock,” John says, eyes squinting at the screen. He reads it twice. Then once more. “Sherlock, it says the phone is her-” he turns to find the man rushing outside, declaring a sudden need for fresh air.Sherlock may be a complex man, full of many layers, but if there’s one thing John’s learned about him, it’s that he wouldn’t go outside for air if he wanted to think. He goes to nicotine patches to think.With a sigh, John rose to his feet and ushered everyone out of his flat, ignoring the knowing look Donovan gave him.“Told you he was a freak,” she says as she crosses the threshold.A twitch of his jaw is all that she gets before he slammed the door in her face. A++++AA AThe force of the gunshot shattered the entire window, glass shards splattering the front of his body and his boots. The gun slide back into his waistband, resting against his back, as John jumped away from the window.His heart is pounding, the thumps of a frantic beat playing like a song in his ears. He turned and raced out of the building, down the steps and around the corner as the sirens begin to blaze in the distance.John’s three streets away before he finally slowed to a stop and kneeled over, breathing hard. He didn’t think to bring a bottle of water with him; of course, there hadn’t been enough time. He was already about to head out and look for Sherlock when the laptop beeped, announcing the acquired signal of the pink lady’s mobile phone. John only had enough time to grab his gun, note down the location and rush out the door.He found himself in the wrong building, searching every hall and room until he was panting hard, coming up empty handed, voice hoarse from screaming Sherlock’s name.Through the tall windows, into the opposite building, he caught sight of the back of a tall man with dark curls and a shorter, old man. He sprang forward, hands on the glass, pounding uselessly and yelling Sherlock’s name. The detective didn’t turn around, nor did the cabbie meet his gaze; John was too far away to be heard. He was useless, only able to observe, unable to intervene. But he had a clear view of everything.The look on Jefferson Hope’s face was something he would never forget. Eyes bright, lips curled in a grin, holding the pill out, taunting, daring Sherlock to take the pill. He saw Sherlock’s arm raise, saw the gloating in the cabbie’s expression, his hand lowering, allowing Sherlock to go first, to swallow first, to die first, for he had to have had the bad pill.“Sherlock,” John said aloud, nails scratching at the glass as his hands balled into fists. “Sherlock, put the pill down. Put the fucking pill down.”Hope raised the pill in a mock toast and their hands slowly started to raise towards their mouths.“Sherlock Holmes- SHERLOCK!” John’s fist smashed against the window in a weak attempt to stop him; the fool couldn’t hear him, of course he couldn’t. He was still bringing the pill up towards his mouth.The pill barely grazed his lips before the gunshot pierced the air, z bullet burying itself into Hope’s chest. John stood there for a second, a brief second, to make sure that Sherlock had dropped the pill and was not going to swallow in while he wasn’t looking, then he took off.John straightened up, his breaths returning back to their normal pace. He knew, as a doctor, that his heartbeats would not return back to their normal pace for a while, but that could easily be explained. He withdrew the gun from behind his back, slid it under the waistband of the front of his trousers, beside his hip, so the flaps of his coat covered it.Then he started jogging. A++++AA A“The bullet they just dug out of the wall is from a handgun. A kill shot over that distance from that kind of weapon, that's a crack shot you're looking for. But not just a marksman, a fighter. His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatized to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, so a strong moral principle. You're looking for a man, probably with a history of military service and nerves of steel-” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as his gaze panned the room, like it usually does, landing on John’s face. He was standing off to the side, out of the chaos, hands locking behind his back and looking around. Slowly, his head turned to meet Sherlock’s gaze.Realization was quick to hit him and he immediately stopped talking. “Actually you know what. Ignore me.”“Sorry?” Lestrade asked, clearly confused.“Ignore all of that. It's just the…” Sherlock trailed off again, tearing his gaze away from that knowing look John was giving him, turning to Lestrade and absentmindedly waving a hand. “Just the shock talking.” With a nod, he started to walk away.“Where are you going?” Lestrade asked, quickly stopping him.“I just need to talk about the man,” Sherlock mumbled. His response made no sense; this was evident to Lestrade as he furrowed his brows.“I still have questions.”“Oh, what now?” Sherlock groaned, reaching up to clutch the ends of the cloth on his back. “I'm in shock – look, I've got a blanket!”“Sherlock-” Lestrade began but was cut off.“And I just caught you a serial killer. More or less,” Sherlock finished with a shrug, sparing a glance backwards at the building, where the body of the old cabbie driver remained, lying in a puddle of his own blood.Lestrade studied his face silently for a moment, before nodding. “Okay, we'll pull you in tomorrow. Off you go.”Sherlock shoved off without a single response back, eyes focused on the doctor. He hadn’t even known the man for two days and already John had killed for him? For him? Obviously the man had waited until Sherlock was in immediate danger, but still, John had killed for him. Killing a man isn’t the easiest thing, but John did it so quickly, with such certainty; he was gone before Sherlock could even turn around.Sherlock knew that he had to pretend that some hit man had taken the cabbie out, but he couldn’t keep the façade up around John. They both knew it was him who pulled the trigger. They both knew he would do it again without a single thought.John watched as Sherlock ducked beneath the police tape and tossed his blanket into the open window of a police car, then spoke. “Sergeant Donovan’s just been explaining everything. Two pills?” he questioned, then shook his head in disbelief. “Dreadful business, isn’t it? Dreadful.”“Good shot,” Sherlock said softly, praising John. It was something different, praising someone. It made John’s eyes light up, ever so slightly.But still he blinked, feigning confusion. “Yes, yes, must have been through that window.”“Well, you would know,” Sherlock said, a light smirk to his tone. “Did you get the powder burn off of your fingers?  I don’t suppose you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case.”John smiled and let his shoulders rise in a minor shrug, letting Sherlock know that he was okay with that. The two men made their way up the stairs, finally, around midnight, bags of Chinese takeout in their hands. They had just managed to slip away from Mrs. Hudson, who'd been in tears and cradled Sherlock’s head to her chest. The sight of his dark curls against her bosom had John hunched over, arms to his stomach as he chortled.The look Sherlock gave him promised to kill him with his own chopsticks.When they finally collapsed in their armchairs, John withdrew a gun from behind his back and set it beside him, then hungrily dug out one of the Styrofoam containers and opened it.Sherlock nodded towards the gun. “Is that it, then?”After swallowing a mouthful of orange chicken, John turned to see what he was referring to. “Oh. Yeah, that’s it.”Sherlock neatly twirled chow mien around his chopsticks and slide them into his mouth. He chewed quickly, thoughtful eyes on the Sig, swallowing so he could speak. “Why’d you do it?”John glanced at it, then at Sherlock, a silvery-blonde brow quirked. “To keep you alive, of course,” he said.Sherlock rolled his eyes and took a bite of the egg roll. “You make it look so easy,” he retorted with his mouth full.John stared at him quietly for a moment, then leaned forward. “I’ve seen many people die; good people, friends, soldiers, comrades. I still have nightmares from the memories. But I assure you, I won’t lose any sleep over this death.”“But-”“Sherlock, he was going to kill you. You’re a bloody idiot who’ll risk his life to prove he’s clever, regardless of the chance, regardless of whether he’ll lose or not. You may be willing to play that game, but I wasn’t.” John moved back against the armchair, lifting a glass of water to his lips to take a drink.A lump formed in Sherlock’s throat. “You care.”“Yes, of course I care,” John rolled his eyes, tone exasperated, a normal occurrence around Sherlock these days. “You’re my friend, you git.”Sherlock stared at John for a moment, then leans across the distance to steals one of John’s sushi rolls. “I would’ve chosen the right pill, had you given me five minutes-”A pack of soy sauce hits him in the forehead and his lips tilt up into a grin. A++++AHis lips fade back into a frown.AThere’s another bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing two bedrooms.AAYes, of course we’ll be needing two.ASherlock’s slender fingers fold underneath his head, tangling in his hair as he lies on his bed, gaze fixated on the ceiling. He watched the fan swivel around, John’s words echoing in his mind.AI’m not his date.ASherlock turned to rest on his side, his eyes closed. He attempted to count sheep but found the process to be redundant and useless; it doesn’t work. He’s awake. Too awake.AYou don’t have a girlfriend, then?AAGirlfriend? No, not really my area.AUnconsciously, his teeth grit. Memories build up against the walls he encased them in, shoving them in the farthest corner of his mind palace, keeping them put away so he never has to relive them. Hoping they’d go away with time, but it’s been over twenty years and they’re still there, hovering in the depths of his brain. Threatening to overpower him at moments when he’s weak, alone, tired. As of right now, he’s all three.Sherlock carefully took a deep breath and shoved them as far back as he can. Bits and pieces slip through and assault him – a flash of rays dancing off the surface of light blonde hair, a glimpse of melting chocolate, the ghost of a hand on the low of his back.The wall slams in place and Sherlock slumps against the mattress, his heartbeat in his ears.ADo you have a boyfriend? Which is fine by the way.AAI know it’s fine.A“It’s perfectly fine,” he muttered to himself, then pressed his face into his pillow. It smelled vaguely like cologne and cigarettes. The scent made his head throb with a longing for a smoke.AI’m not his date.ASherlock’s mind still couldn’t process the past few days, which, if spoken aloud, would shock everyone, including himself. But that was John Watson for you. Deducing him was easy, as always. Before the first night, Sherlock could tell that John suffered from nightmares, due to the bags under his eyes, the slouch of his steps, the lack of moisture in his eyes and the way he blinked twice as much as the normal human being to keep his eyelids from drooping. His suspicions were confirmed when he woke up to use the restroom around midnight and heard John thrashing about in his sleep.He’d stopped by the cracked door and peeked in, torn between leaving and tentatively going inside to comfort John, when he awoke with a loud gasp. Sherlock quickly left, making it look like John had been alone all this time.The simple things were easy to figure out. John’s preference of music, his clothing style, how he likes his tea, the precise order in which he shaves. Sherlock was able to figure all of that out by a day living with the man. His motives, however, were far beyond his comprehending.John killed a man for him. Why? To save him, because he cared about Sherlock, of course, but what was his real motive? Having a gun and killing the serial killer to save the victim was something anyone would do if given the chance; that didn’t count. There had to have been a different motive for John to pull the trigger. He couldn’t have saved Sherlock just because it was the right thing to do.Sherlock had been mulling over that since he came to the realization that John had shot and killed Jefferson Hope.AI’m not his date.AJohn cared. He said Sherlock was his friend. He told Sherlock that straight to his face.He thought back to his childhood. He had no friends. Compassion was a human weakness. John was a prime example of this, willing to risk his freedom in order to keep Sherlock alive – and he’d only known him for a few days.John cared.AI’m not his date.AIt didn’t make any sense.Sherlock rolled on his back and covered his face with his long fingers, groaning. Then he peeked through them to check the time. It was only 10:34 p.m. Normally, at this time on a Friday, he would be at the pub, dancing and drinking the night away until he either went to some stranger’s house or they came to his. Rarely did he ever spend a full night, alone, in his flat, but ever since John moved in, he couldn’t very well sneak off every night…Sherlock slowly slid his hands off his face and stayed there for a moment, then sat up and silently began to take his robe off. A++++AA A“Where are you off to?”The hand gripping the doorknob tightened. A low sigh slid through Sherlock’s teeth, laced with shit.He turned around to see John standing there, still fully dressed. His eyes were wide open, but Sherlock could see the red in them. Another nightmare, more than likely. He wondered how he didn’t hear John this time. From the looks of his rugged appearance, he must have fallen asleep on the couch.“A walk.”“Don’t lie to me,” John snapped.Sherlock blinked twice, then coolly tilted his head. “What makes you think I’m lying?”“You never go out for walks. It isn’t your thing,” John moved by Sherlock to grab his coat.“What are you doing?”“I’m going with you.”“It’s late and you’re tired.”John straightened the flaps of his coat out and rolled his shoulders back, then glared at Sherlock. “I could say the same for you.”“I’m wide awake,” Sherlock argued.John rolled his eyes and yanked the door open. A++++AA A“You know, when most people go for a walk, they usually mean around the block, not three blocks away from their home on a dark and cold and very late November evening,” John said after a few minutes of silence.Sherlock slid his hands into his trench coat pockets and pressed his arms close to his sides. John was right about the cold; he was freezing. He’d planned on hailing a taxi, until John decided to tag along.“That would be because we aren’t going home,” he said.John turned to look at the detective, then furrowed his brows. “You said-”“I said I was going for a walk. I never said I was going to come back.”“Then,” John slid his hand out of his pocket to check his watch. “Where could we possibly be going at nearly midnight?”They rounded the corner and Sherlock caught sight of a familiar neon green sign. A smile touched his lips.“We, John Watson, are going to a nightclub.”Sherlock continued to march down the street, his stride changing. Just moments ago, he was tense, rushed, huddling into himself due to the cold breeze. Now he’s standing tall, head held high and shoulders squared, gaze locked on the club’s doors. John sees what he can only describe as longing in Sherlock’s eyes.He’s been here before.“A nightclub?” John repeated, moving quickly to catch up with the long-legged detective.Normally, Sherlock would’ve taken the opportunity to belittle John, but instead he nodded absentmindedly.“You said you were going for a walk, not going to a nightclub.”“This is a walk.”“You would have taken a cab.”“I was planning to until you tagged along.”John’s fists clench. “Then why did you bloody lie?” he growled.They arrive at the doors. Sherlock slid his wallet out of his back pocket and thumbed out a few notes, then handed them to the bouncer.John made to take out his wallet, but was stopped with a hand on his shoulder. “I’ve got it. And because I wanted you to come,” Sherlock said quietly, then turned and made his way into the club.John blinked, then turned to see the bouncer staring at him. Hand rubbing the spot that Sherlock touched, he quickly moved to catch up. A++++AA ASherlock was a regular, clearly. They made their way to the bar and the bartender slid over a mug of beer. Sherlock wrapped his hands around it and raised it to his lips, his other hand holding up a finger. The bartender slid another mug over to John and he fingered it lightly, watching Sherlock.The atmosphere was akin to a crime scene in the way it affected Sherlock. A flush was rising in his cheeks and it wasn’t from the alcohol; it showed up the moment they walked inside and the heat of a hundred twisting bodies engulfed them. His green eyes got brighter, if that was even possible.“I didn’t know you could dance,” John said.Without taking his eyes off the dance floor, Sherlock’s lips tilt up into a smile. “Not that well, unfortunately, but it is fun.”“I thought you didn’t like fun,” the words come out before he can think them through and John tightens his lips, internally groaning at himself for being so blunt.Sherlock’s lips also tighten. Half a song passes before he takes another drink and tears his eyes away to look at John. His voice is serious when he says, “You thought wrong.”After a few minutes of having the beverage in their hands, Sherlock had finished his off. People were writhing and gliding and sliding against each other. Loud bass and bright neon lights danced off the walls, reflecting in his eyes. John watched as Sherlock stood up. His trench coat was gone, somewhere John didn’t know, the cuffs of Sherlock’s shirt loose, the top button undone.Without another word to John, he disappeared into the crowd.John frowned. What was he to do now? He enjoyed dancing, but hadn’t been to a club since his early twenties. He feared he wouldn’t remember how to dance. He considered going after Sherlock, to learn by observing, but a thought occurred to him: who was Sherlock dancing with? He couldn’t see the detective over the mass of people, but he was in there, entangling with someone with the beat of a song dancing with the beat of his heart.John swiveled around the bar stool and placed the mug on the counter.“Another, mate?”“Yes.”“Make that two.”Baritone rang in his ears as he turned back around. Sherlock was standing beside him, a hand on the counter. Sweat coated his light gray shirt and John’s eyes examined it for a second before moving back to his face. His eyes were blazing, smiling at John in a way he couldn’t quite decipher.“Looking to get drunk?” John asked.Sherlock took a large gulp of his replenished glass, then leaned closer to John. “That’s the plan.”“Don’t expect me to carry you home.”“Oh, Captain Watson,” Sherlock said, his lips tilted into a wolfish grin. “That’s also part of the plan.”",Then There Was Something,3506

Holmes/Molly Hooper,"Sherlock has a question that can only be solved with Molly's help, but will the end result bring them closer together or push them further apart?","AMolly had avoided Sherlock like the plague since the incident in the laboratory.  The younger Sherlock that is.  The elder had come round to apologise on his brother’s behalf and they had been spending more time together.  Only as friends of course.  Their one night stand had been just that…one night.The only reason that she was even at Baker Street was because the Sherlock had asked her to meet him with the promise that his younger brother would be out.  She should have known better than to agree to a meeting in hostile territory.“Planning to slap me again?” Sherlock asked as he stood, poring over his clue wall.“That depends.  Are you going to say something rude again?”“Probably.”Molly pursed her lips.  “Then yes.”“Was your evening with my brother satisfactory?  Perhaps you were hoping to compare our methods.”“There is no comparison.”“Quite right.  What I lack in experience, I make up for in familiarity.  I know you better.  I’m more attuned to your preferences.”“He sorted them fine on his own,” Molly retorted defiantly.Sherlock turned to face her.  “Shall we conduct an experiment?”“Experiment?”Sherlock moved closer to Molly, closer than she was used to him being.  For the briefest of moments, she thought he might give her a hug, but that was very un-Sherlock like.  Then again so was kissing, which was exactly what he did.Shock didn’t even begin to convey the exact emotion Molly was feeling.  Sherlock’s hands were on her face, warm and gentle, and his lips were firmly pressed against hers.  She stood there frozen, unable to move partially out of shock and also out of fear that he would stop.  Eventually, she found her courage and dared to touch him.  Her hand alit just barely above his shoulders.  When he didn’t react negatively, she decided to throw caution into the wind and really go for it.  Her fingers tangled themselves in his curls and she kissed him back with the passion of years’ worth of yearning.Sherlock pulled away abruptly and held Molly at arm’s length by the shoulders.  “How was that for you?”“Good.”  Molly blinked a few times.  “Great even.”Sherlock nodded.  “Shall we press on?” he asked.“Press on?” Molly questioned“The next phase of the experiment.”“Next…phase…”  Molly turned red.  “Sex?”“Yes.”“Now?”“Yes.”“J-j-just…just like that?”“Would you prefer a meal first?”“No.”  Molly shook head.  “Just…why?”“I have a question that needs answering,” Sherlock said simply.  “One that can only be solved through certain…methods.   Methods that require your presence.”“A question?”“Yes,” Sherlock answered.  “Would you be opposed?”Molly shook her head.  “No.  I just…are you sure I’m not dreaming?”“Not a dream,” Sherlock said quickly.  “Now, would you prefer the bed or somewhere else?”“The bed is fine.”As soon as the words left her lips, Sherlock pulled her towards his bedroom.  He said it wasn’t a dream, but there she was in his room and snogging on his bed.  It certainly felt like a dream.  And yet…“Wait,” Molly said so softly that it could almost be considered a whisper.Sherlock drew his hands away from her as if he were afraid she might detonate at the slightest touch.  “Did I do something wrong?”“No.”  Molly smiled at him and caressed his cheek.  “You’re perfect.  It’s me.”Sherlock met her eyes with a confused stare.  “I thought this was what you wanted.”“It is.  It’s just…”  Molly exhaled sharply.  “I know it probably sounds silly, but I’ve dreamed of this moment so much.  The when, the where and the how, each time it was different, but one thing was always the same.  The why,” she said.  “In my head, it was always because you wanted me just as much as I wanted you.”“Molly…”Molly pressed her finger to his mouth.  “Please let me finish,” she asked.  He gave a single nod and she lowered her hand with a sigh.  “I know things are different for you,” she told him.  “I’d never want to change that about you.  Honestly, I doubt I could even if I tried,” she added with a quiet laugh.  “You mean so much to me, Sherlock.  Probably more than any other man ever has or ever will.  What I’m saying is…”  She paused to gather her courage.  “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.  I love you with every fibre of my being.  And because I love you, I’m going to walk away right now.”Sherlock said something next that she wasn’t used to hearing him say.  “I don’t understand.”“It’s a bit like that part of the Bible that says love isn’t selfish and it doesn’t insist on its own way,” Molly explained.  “I’m not particularly religious, but that always stuck with me.  So as much as I would love to stay here and fall into your arms and let you make all of my dreams come true, it’s not right because…it’s not you.  I can tell you care, Sherlock.  This alone is proof positive.”  She stared into his eyes.  “And it’s enough for me,” she assured him.  “Loving you and knowing that you care for me in return is enough.”Sherlock sat up straight and stared ahead as if to process her words.  Molly wasn’t going to disturb him because she was sure he had a lot to think about.  So she quietly stood up and let him to his thoughts.As soon as Molly stepped out of 221B onto the pavement, she felt the tears come.  She wasn’t entirely sure why she was crying, but she knew she couldn’t stop them so she gave into the outpouring of emotion.  She pulled her collar up high around her face, and looped her scarf around to shield her tears.  She had embarrassed herself enough for one day.  She didn’t need to be the lonely girl crying on the tube too.  She was barely a few metres away when she felt Sherlock’s long fingers grip her shoulders and turn her body towards his.Sherlock’s gaze fixed on hers.  It was hard and determined.  “I won’t pretend to know how this works.  To do so would be pointless and as you know I’m deliberate in everything I do,” he said.  “You are…more than just an experiment.   I don’t have the words which is new for me and extremely frustrating,” he confessed.  He closed his eyes and paused thoughtfully.  Molly wasn’t sure what to do other than stay still while he retreated to his mind palace.  “A litmus test,” he said finally.“Sorry?”Sherlock opened his eyes.  “I don’t want to conduct an experiment.  I want to perform a litmus test,” he said.  “These feelings…this is all new and it’s extremely vexing.  So I need to make sense of it in the only way I know how to do so,” he explained.  “I would hope that you could be patient while I figure things out.”Molly nodded.  “I can.  I will.”“Good.”  Sherlock gave a curt nod and took her by the hand.  “Let’s go.”Molly stumbled along behind him for a few steps before she regained her footing.  “Go where?”“Back to Baker Street.  Haven’t you been listening?” Sherlock asked without looking back.  “We’re going to perform a test.”  He paused and looked back at her.  “Is that alright?”Molly squeezed his hand.  Sherlock looked down at their hands then back up at her.  “Yes,” she answered with a slight flush to her cheeks.Molly was surprised she even made it to back Sherlock’s flat.  She had gone all weak in the knees and she wasn’t entirely sure how her legs managed to carry her weight, but they did, straight back to his bedroom.This was really happening.  All the daydreams and fantasies she had of her and Sherlock over the years.  Now it was finally happening.  It wasn’t a false start like before.  This time there was no turning back.His hands cradled her face again.  Palms warm against her cheeks followed again by the newly familiar sensation of his lips on hers.  He broke away again, much to Molly’s dismay, to untie her scarf.  He shrugged off his suit jacket and Molly removed her own coat as well.  He was about to start on his shirt, but Molly interjected.“Let me,” she said.  Sherlock paused to consider the request before ultimately relinquishing the task to her.  Molly bit her bottom lip as her fingers worked on the buttons one by one, giving his shirt a quick tug to untuck it from his trousers so she could finish off the last few buttons.Sherlock reached to remove her hair tie so that her hair fell loose around her shoulders.  Then he pulled her jumper up over her head and undid the buttons on her blouse with much steadier hands than she had.  Her blouse was on the ground before she knew it.  Along with his shirt, two pairs of trousers, socks, his boxers and, thankfully, one of her more presentable sets of matching bra and knickers.They came together again beneath the sheets, side by side so neither one had the distinct advantage, but she let him take the lead anyway.  Palms on her face.  Fingers in his hair.  Lips pressed together.  Chest to chest.  Hips aligned.  Legs tangled.  Sherlock’s movements were focused and deliberate.  Every so often he would steal a glance at her face.  He was trying to gauge her reactions, she realised.  Even now, he was still deducing her.“Don’t think,” Molly breathed against his earlobe.  “Just do what feels right.”  Sherlock met her eyes with a startled expression and for a fraction of a second, she was afraid he might stop all together.  Instead, he rolled them over so that he was on top of her.  His movements took on a new fluidity.  He was still deducing her, but his responses were fuelled by his instincts rather than a conscious thought process.  He didn’t bother to check her reactions anymore either, but Molly was sure that the sounds she was making let him and anyone in shouting distance know exactly what she was experiencing.After their bodies stilled, Molly closed her eyes and sighed.  She wanted to stay in the moment forever.  She wanted to permanently burn the memory into her mind so that she could never forget a second of it.  The touch of his long fingers on her skin, the taste of his lips, the smell of his shampoo when the buried his face into the crook of her neck, the sound of his voice as he called her name and the look of his eyes in those final moments.“You’re still in bed,” Sherlock’s voice broke her from her thoughts.  “I didn’t hurt you, did I?”Molly blushed and sat up.  Sherlock had been in the process of getting dressed, but he stopped to address her.  “No.  Just thinking.”“About sex.”Molly’s cheeks burned a bit redder if that was even possible.  “Well, yes.”“An evaluation of my performance, perhaps?”  Sherlock suggested.  “Notes could be helpful for future reference, but please do refrain from mentioning your liaison with my brother.”Molly winced at his words.  “I could say the same for you,” she retorted bitterly.  She gathered the sheet around herself and slid off the bed to retrieve her clothes.“Modesty is futile at this point, wouldn’t you say?” Sherlock asked.  “I’m in possession of intimate knowledge of your body.”Molly exhaled sharply and defiantly clung to the sheet.  “You’re bloody impossible!”  She gathered the last of her clothes and stumped off to the bathroom to get dressed.  When she emerged, fully dressed, she found him once again inspecting his clue wall.“I’ve devised an answer to my question and it would seem that my brother was onto something,” Sherlock said casually without looking at her.  “Your night together has indeed sparked something in me.”“Do you know what?”  Molly asked angrily.  “This…”  She gestured between the two of them.  “This meant more to me than anything I ever shared with your brother, but you just had to ruin it!”  Sherlock turned to face her.  “It was supposed to be special, but you had to go and turn it into another competition with him, didn’t you?  He never made it about you.  It was always about me.  My comfort.  My needs.  I thought this was the same, but clearly I was wrong.”  She looped her scarf around her neck.  “Well I can tell you one thing right now.  There really isn’t a comparison between the two of you.  You may be the better detective, but you’re definitely not the better man.”Molly turned and left with her head held high.  It wasn’t until she was several blocks away that her shoulders slumped down and her courage left her.  Sherlock hadn’t followed after her, but she didn’t expect him to this time.  She reached for her mobile and dialled Martha’s number.  “Martha, I need you,” she said when Martha answered.  “I’ve really stepped in it this time.”",The Experiment,2184

It was a last resort plan. He was afraid of the consequences of that act. He wasn't wrong, but he never thought it would be this bad.","A                He never meant for it to end this way. He had planned for this option, but he never wanted this to happen. Sherlock was afraid of how killing this man in cold blood would make him feel. That's why he was hesitant. But there was no other way. As Magnussen himself kept saying, all the information was in his head, in his mind palace. The only way to destroy it, or get rid of it, was to kill the man. Sherlock waited until he couldn't anymore. They were trapped. Police was surrounding them. Sherlock discreetly took John's gun and, without another thought, put a bullet through Magnussen's brain. Merry Christmas indeed.A A A                Sherlock was pacing around Jim's tiny flat. It was Christmas' Eve. Everything was in place to take on Magnussen the next day. He even had a back-up plan in case something went wrong. Call it a feeling in his gut, a doubt in his own capacity to deduce, but Sherlock had asked John to bring his gun, just in case. Moriarty knew all about the plan of course, and he thought it was a great one. He couldn't figure out why Sherlock seemed so nervous though, it wasn't like him at all.A""Will you come sit with me? Your constant moving is driving me insane!""A""It can't, you already are insane.""A                Jim smiled and Sherlock joined him on the couch. The detective didn't seem to be able to stay still and kept tapping his fingers nervously on Moriarty's thigh.A""Sherlock, what's going on?""A""Nothing. I'm worried about tomorrow.""A""Why would you be? Your plan is flawless. You go to him, give him the laptop, he shows you the archives, you destroy the info and if anything goes wrong you put a bullet through his brain. You are Sherlock Holmes, you are the smartest man there is, stop worrying.""A""I might have to kill him. And I'm afraid if I do, I'll enjoy it, like you do. But helping people is what I do. Solving puzzles is who I am. I'm afraid if I murder Magnussen, I'll enjoy it and I'll want to do it again. I'm afraid I'll start creating puzzles instead of solving them.""A""So you are worried because you don't want to be more like me.""A""This isn't who I am. You make the puzzles and I find the answers. How would we distract ourselves if neither of us was on the side of the angels?""A""I won't let that happen, Sherlock. And you love puzzles as much as you love me, you could never stop solving them, you're addicted to it.""A""I'm also addicted to opiates and I quit that.""A""Oh yeah. Is that why I found you unable to stand up, next to a stolen bag of morphine last night? Because you quit your drug habit?""A""I don't have a drug habit, Jim. The morphine is medical. I got shot only a few weeks ago.""A""If you say so.""A                They didn't talk again for a while. Jim pulled Sherlock into his arms and started absently playing with the curly hair he loved so much. He wouldn't insist on the subject, but he was worried too. He worried about the effect killing a man in cold blood could have on the detective's drug habit. Would it be worsened by guilt or would the thrill of taking a life become a new drug to replace the others? They spent the remaining of the evening in silence, simply enjoying the proximity of one another. In the end, Jim had to shake Sherlock awake.A""It's getting late, you have to go now. Mycroft will be at your flat early and you can't have him wondering where you spent the night.""A""He would easily find out about you.""A""Exactly. Now go. I don't want to see you until you've beaten Magnussen.""A""I won't be able to see you for a while if I end up killing him.""A""I know. But if you have to be bad, don't let it be ordinary.""A""Oh, you know I like giving a show as much as you do.""A""Make me a proud villain, Sherlock Holmes.""A A A                Sherlock had been locked in a cell for days while they were deciding on a punishment for him. He wasn't allowed visitors, so when the door finally opened, he hadn't had human contact since Mycroft personally brought him there. Sherlock didn't even ask to call anyone because it would have been too risky to contact Moriarty from there. He was certain the criminal would find a way to learn what happened, maybe by having Billy go and ask John, maybe by using one of his many tricks.A""Brother mine, you really got yourself into trouble this time.""A""Oh, Mycroft, stop pretending you care and tell me what you've decided to do with me.""A""You will go on an undercover assignment for us in Western Europe.""A""Is that the same one you estimate will kill me in 6 months?""A""Yes.""A""So you think I'm dangerous then. You think I won't be able to resist killing again.""A""It's a thought that crossed our minds, yes.""A                Mycroft seemed to want to say more, but he had to stop and swallow before he was able to get the words out.A""You know, brother dear, I never wanted things to end this way. I know you don't believe it, but I don't want to lose you. I truly care about you, Sherlock. And I don't expect you to respond to that, I know you don't have a clue how to.""A                The Holmes brothers looked into each other's eyes for several minutes. They didn't need to talk to fill the moment with emotion. After all, what do you say to a sibling when you know this is your last day together?A A A                When Sherlock got back to his flat to change and pick up some things, Jim was waiting for him in his bedroom. The detective explained the situation and silence came between them for a few minutes.A""When are you leaving?""A""Tonight, Mycroft is waiting for me outside. I'm so sorry, we won't be able to see each other again. You deserved better than you got with me.""A""You were perfect for me, Sherlock. I can't believe your own brother is sending you off to die.""A""It's better this way. I deserve the punishment.""A""Death? You're saying you deserve death for killing one man? After all those lives you saved? This is why I don't try to be good, see where it got you.""A""Jim, don't. Please.""A""No, Sherlock, this is unfair and you know it. You shouldn't do it. You should run away. Join me in fake death. We can do good and bad things together in secret, but mostly bad.""A""I'm going, Jim. I'm doing the job. Maybe Mycroft is wrong this time, maybe I'll survive this.""A""Oh, Sherlock, stop lying to yourself, this is too ordinary. Your brother is never wrong.""A""I'm sorry, Jim, I love you, but there is nothing you can say to convince me to run.""A                Moriarty pulled the detective in a tight embrace, locked his fingers in the dark curls and glued their lips together. It was a desperate kiss. The kiss of a man who never wanted to let go, a man prepared to tear the world apart to get his way. Sherlock leaned into it. He let passion take hold one last time. Jim meant that kiss to convince him to stay, but the detective was saying goodbye. The simple thought of their separation brought tears to Sherlock's eyes. The criminal kissed them away and, after locking his browns with the blues one last time, the consultants parted ways, never meant to see each other again. Jim went back to his flat, thinking how nice it would've been if Mycroft hadn't kept the details of the mission's location secret, how much he would've loved joining his lover there. Maybe then Sherlock would've had a chance to survive. Now, Jim's home felt uncomfortably empty.A A A                The first thing Sherlock did after getting off the plane was separate himself from John, Mary and Mycroft. He quickly made up an excuse, saying he needed time alone to think about what it all meant, and rushed to find Moriarty.A""What you did was incredibly stupid, Jim."" He said, as he entered the small flat.A""Yes, I don't know what took over me, next time I'll just let you go to your impending death.""A""You really are keeping your promise, aren't you?""A""I am a man of my words, my dear Sherlock, but remind me which one that was?""A""When you said you would burn the heart out of me.""A""Well, you left me no other choice. And now that Magnussen is out of the picture, there is no reason for me to keep hiding and we get to play again.""A                They shared a smile. They always enjoyed their game, trying to get at each other, flirting over bombs and tea. It was a simpler time, when all was innocent and no real feelings were involved. Before they fell in love and everything became so complicated. At first, they did go back to their old ways. Moriarty helped crimes happen or committed them himself and Lestrade was baffled as ever. Sherlock investigated with John and occasionally Mary, when her pregnancy wasn't getting in the way. It was good, but it didn't last.A                Late one night, during an empty stretch between two cases, Sherlock showed up at Jim's. What alarmed the criminal wasn't how high he was, no, that had happened regularly since Magnussen's death. No, what alarmed Moriarty was how distraught the detective looked. And not just that. Usually, Sherlock would go on and on and talk about stuff, or they'd occupy themselves doing things that busied their lips otherwise. But that night, he was quiet. He looked awful and stricken with guilt, but wouldn't say a word.A""Sherlock,"" Jim started, ""did something happen?""A                The detective raised his eyes to meet Moriarty's concerned stare. He looked so vulnerable like this. Jim used to appreciate seeing him like this. Well, he still did. When it was part of the game. When this appearance of vulnerability was the result of the criminal's brilliant work. And this time it definitely wasn't.A""Tell me now who's the bastard that's got down you down like this. I'll find him and I'll skin him. I'd enjoy nothing more.""A""Then go get a knife and do it. You have him sitting on your couch and, believe me, he's not going anywhere.""A""Sherlock, what are you saying? What have you done?""A""I killed a man, Jim. This is what I was afraid would happen if I murdered Magnussen. I couldn't stop myself. I just wanted to feel that thrill again. To get this sensation of invincibility and power. And now I feel terrible.""A                Sherlock's eyes were locked on his own hands. He couldn't summon enough strength to look at the expression on his boyfriend's face. What if this changed Jim's opinion of who he was and he stopped loving him? What if the criminal wasn't interested to be with someone even more like himself? Sherlock didn't want to see it.A""I'm supposed to be on the side of the angels. People expect me to save them, that's who I am. I don't want to be the kind of man who takes lives for the simple pleasure of it, for a distraction when I'm bored.""A                He put his face in his hands and Jim wrapped his arms around him.A""We'll figure it out, honey, I won't let you lose yourself.""A                They stayed silent for a while. Moriarty stroked Sherlock's hair to help him calm down. When he felt it was working, he finally asked the question that had been burning his mind with curiosity.A""Who did you kill?""A""Does it matter? He was a person and I put a stop to his life. Nothing could excuse what I did.""A""Alright, don't tell me if you don't want to. But let me help you, let me take the fall for this. I assume Lestrade will need your help to solve this murder?""A""Yes.""A""Then together we can make the evidence point to me. All the police in the country is already after me and you'd keep your good name. Everybody wins.""A""Except the victim.""A""Well, it's already too late for him, isn't it, Sherlock?""A""I suppose you are right, as usual.""A                And so they followed the consultant criminal's plan and framed the whole thing on Moriarty. But it didn't solve the guilt problem. Sherlock started getting high daily and frequently spent the night in the abandoned building with other junkies. Jim tried to keep him occupied with crimes to solve, which seemed to help, but as soon as the detective had more than 24 hours between cases, he would become the perpetrator of a growing number of unsolved murders. Nothing seemed to bring any comfort to Sherlock and Jim was running out of ideas.A                It had been a week since Moriarty had last seen the detective when there was a knock on the door. Nobody ever knocked. Sherlock was the only one to know he lived there and he always entered like in his own home. But Jim was a curious man and he opened the door anyway. He didn't know who he had expected to see standing on the other side, but one thing was certain, nothing could've surprised him more than the sight of a disheveled Mycroft Holmes.A""Jim, I love you with all my heart, but I can't be you. Sorry. -SH"" He read from a small piece of paper. ""It appears my brother cared deeply about you. And so it seems only fair you would get to say goodbye.""A                Jim didn't want to believe what Mycroft was implying. It simply wasn't possible. He followed him into the car anyway, because there really wasn't anything else he could have done. They rode in silence and none of them dared break it when they got to St Bart's. Moriarty followed the older Holmes to the morgue where a single body lay on a table, under a cloth. No one else was there.A""I asked everyone to leave. You are still a wanted criminal, after all.""A                Jim didn't answer. His eyes were fixed on the body. This had to be a bad dream. This couldn't be real.A""I'll give you a moment of privacy.""A                Mycroft left and Moriarty found himself alone with the body. He approached the table, slowly. He took a deep breath before pulling the cloth off the corpse's face. Nothing could've prepared him for what he saw. It was Sherlock, as he had feared, as the note Mycroft had given him indicated. It was Sherlock just lying there, paler than ever, with the back of his head blown up. It was Sherlock, the ever talking man, always eager to show off his intelligence, now irreversibly quiet. His eyes were closed and that's what broke Jim. The realization that those beautiful blue eyes would never look at him again, that this face would never animate again to exchange wordless expressions with him. Never again would Jim hear that voice, that deep, wonderful voice he'd loved since the first time they'd met.A""I didn't mean it, Sherlock, I never meant it. When I said I was going to kill you one day, I didn't mean it.""A                Tears were pouring down Moriarty's face, impossible to control. He felt somehow responsible for the detective's death, like his enjoyment of murder poisoned his lover until he fell in an eternal slumber.A""I love you, Sherlock, I always did. I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better, I should've tried harder to help you. Oh Sherlock...""A                Jim laid his head on Sherlock's unmoving chest. He stayed there, crying, unable to get himself to leave. It must have been close to an hour later when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Mycroft was back.A""I brought you his coat if you want to keep it.""A""Thank you.""A                Jim took the coat and put it on. It still smelled like Sherlock.A""It's time for you to go now. And I have to warn you. I did this nice thing for you because my dear brother loved you, but you are still a wanted criminal, if I see you again, I will have you arrested.""A""Of course. You won't see me again though.""A""My people and I will be at this cupboard you call a flat in two days. I don't think I'm wrong if I expect to find it empty, am I?""A""Are you ever wrong, Mycroft?""A""No.""A                Both men exchanged looks that expressed the extent of their shared pain. Jim squeezed Sherlock's hand one last time and left. He wrapped the coat tightly around him and went back to his flat. He'd have to find somewhere else to go really soon, but for now, he just lay on the couch Sherlock and him had spent so much time on, just talking and cuddling. Jim missed the detective dearly and for the time being, couldn't think of doing anything other than staying there, encircled by his soul mate's smell.",Forseeable Disaster,2874

Aiming for Parentlock.","AJohn grabbed his medical kit from the closet in 221B and raced back down the stairs to 221C.  The door was still open, so he simply walked inside without knocking.  He usually knocked.  They had a code.  Tessa was lying on the sofa in the sitting room, and he walked straight over to her.  He knelt down, sat his medical kit on the floor, and pulled out his stethoscope.  “Nothing to worry about, darling.  Just checking your breathing.”  The young girl looked worried, and John wanted to put her at ease.  He listened to her lungs and breathed a sigh of relief.  “Everything sounds fine.  But you do have a fever, so I would like you to take some medicine.  Will you do that for me, Tessa?”  She nodded.  John looked pointedly at Aneesh, who fetched a glass of water from the kitchen.  John gave her the Paracetamol and the water, and she drank them down.  John smiled at her and pulled the blanket up around her shoulders.  “Now then, I want you to get some rest tonight, okay?  We’ll have you feeling better in no time.”John stood up and pulled Aneesh into the kitchen.  “Make sure you come get me if she gets any worse.  I wish she would sleep upstairs tonight.”  John frowned and glanced back toward the sitting room.  “Do you think there’s any chance she would consent to sleeping upstairs?  I really would like to keep an eye on her.”  Aneesh spoke firmly but kindly, “You know she won’t do that, Doctor Watson. I’m sorry.”  John nodded in agreement sadly, scratching at his stubble.  “I know.  But you WILL wake me if she gets worse?  You know I don’t mind being woken up.”  Aneesh smiled at the doctor.  “I know, Doctor Watson.  We all know.  It will be okay.  I will take care of her.”  John clapped Aneesh on the shoulder, “I know you will.”They walked back into the sitting room.  John glanced around  at the other children, trying to see if any of them were hiding any injuries from him.  He couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary, but then he didn’t have Sherlock’s deductive skills.  He wished Sherlock was here.  As if summoned by John’s thoughts, John heard the front door to 221 open and close quickly.  “Darius, can you see if that’s Sherlock?”  Darius nodded at John and stepped out into the hall.  A moment later, Sherlock entered 221C with Darius at his heels.  Sherlock nodded at John, who glanced around at the children.Sherlock understood John’s gesture, and scanned the room.  “Ian, what happened to your left foot?  You are not putting any weight on it, even though you are trying to hide that fact by leaning on James.”AAJohn looked at Ian and raised his hands in a question.  Ian shrugged and looked down, “You don’t have time to patch us all up, Doctor Watson.  It’s fine.  It don’t hurt no more.”  Sherlock frowned at Ian, “Please try to remember the correct grammar next time.  It doesn’t hurt anymore, Ian.   Also, you’re lying.  The pain is obvious from the way you are standing.  Have a seat.  John?”  And Sherlock motioned to Ian.  Ian looked guiltily to James, who then helped him limp over to the chair.  As John tended to Ian, Sherlock continued to scan the rest of the children.  Sherlock motioned to two of the oldest kids.  “PJ, Carmen, were you able to see if anyone entered the warehouse after 3:00 today?”  PJ spoke first, “Yes, Mr. Holmes.  Two men and a woman went in at 3:30 and stayed in there for an hour.  Then they left in a blue car.”  Carmen chimed in, “I got the license number for you, Mr. Holmes.”  She handed him a scrap of paper.  “Excellent work.  Thank you.  Now, are any of you in need of anything?  Have you eaten dinner tonight?”AAJohn looked up from where he was tending to Ian’s foot.  He was surprised that Sherlock had asked them about dinner.  He normally didn’t think of that sort of thing, even though John always did.  Sherlock went on, “John and I were going to order Chinese tonight.  Any requests?”  The kids all looked at each other, and then Aneesh stepped forward and said, “Anything you have left over is fine with us, Mr. Holmes.  We don’t need much.  We make our way.”AA“Of course you do, Aneesh.  But if we are already ordering for the two of us, we can easily order a little extra.  I know you love those pot stickers.  Anyone else want anything special?”  Sherlock looked around the room.  No one said anything.  He sighed.  “Okay, John will you have your usual?”  John nodded and smiled at Sherlock.  Sherlock blessed John with one of his rare crinkly-eyed grins as he swept out of 221C, presumably to call the Chinese restaurant.AAJohn finished up with Ian’s foot (ice packs and a wrap) and addressed all the kids.  “I know you all think Sherlock doesn’t want kids upstairs, but as I keep telling you, he doesn’t mind.  He likes having you all around, and so do I.  You are welcome up there anytime.  Plus, if you come up, we can bring Tessa up too and I can keep a better eye on her for awhile.  Can you come up just for awhile tonight?”All the kids look to Aneesh, the unofficial leader of this unlikely gang of forgotten children.  These kids, all street kids before Mrs. Hudson started feeding them up, were all now unofficial residents of 221C.  They had never come up to 221B.  Not even once.  But now with Tessa sick, Aneesh looked as if he was considering it.  John knew that the kids had their own reasons for being careful and skeptical around adults.  They were not here because they had happy, safe childhoods.  But John, Sherlock, and Mrs. Hudson were doing their best now to make it as happy and safe as it could be.  To the extent that the kids would allow, anyway.  The fact that they all agreed to sleep in the previously vacant 221C instead of on the streets was a huge first step.  Sherlock sometimes employed the kids to do easy surveillance missions, nothing that would ever put them in danger, but just enough so that they accepted payment from him without protest.  John patched all of them up whenever they needed it. He also kept an eye out for the occasional fever, like Tessa tonight.  He gave Paracetamol for the occasional headache, tissues for the common cold, and kept the kids in supply of toothpaste and new toothbrushes.  Sherlock gave Mrs. Hudson money to buy the kids food and clothing.  Even Mycroft did his part to help the kids.  He paid the rent for 221C.  Aneesh looked at the kids one at a time, staring intently into their faces.  “I think we should go up to 221B tonight, for Tessa’s sake.  We’ll all be together.  It will be fine.  Okay?”  One by one the kids nodded their agreement.  John knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door as he passed, inviting her upstairs.  She was already falling asleep in her chair, and declined the invitation to join them upstairs, but was surprised and thrilled that the kids had finally agreed to go upstairs into 221B.  John knew that when the food arrived, everyone’s favorite dishes would be there.  He hoped that the kids would all camp out on the floor so that he could keep a close eye on Tessa’s fever.  He thought they might watch some Doctor Who and eat some biscuits.  If anyone had ever told John a few years ago that his idea of family would look like this - rude, brilliant boyfriend, motherly figure down the hall, and taking care of a brood of homeless children - he wouldn’t have believed them.  But this was his life, and he wouldn’t trade it for anything.",The Unlikely Inhabitants of 221C,1325

John was trailing behind, his short legs pumping twice as fast to meet the detective’s long stride. They reached a large open room with a set of double doors at the end of it and the pair charged through and straight into another building. Deductions and escape routes were running through his mind and it took a moment to register John yelling at him from behind. “Sherlock!  Sherlock, what in the hell are we doing?” he panted and Sherlock didn’t look back as he replied “Improvising!” Though he couldn’t see behind him, Sherlock could feel the eye roll and smirked despite himself. A He started up the stairs of what seemed to be an old apartment building left to ruins. Some walls were missing, past lives spilling and mixing together. A long hallway stretched in front of them and Sherlock called back “John, when we reach the end of the hall, you go right and I’ll go left... Try to hide the best you can”A “Sherlock, that n¬” A“It shouldn’t be hard considering what you lack in stature...” he smirked and an audible sigh could be heard from John. The intersection came fast and Sherlock turned left, the sounds of mobsters below filling his ears. Sherlock spared a glance back at John who was sprinting down the other hallway, looking back at Sherlock. He gave a quick nod and raced down the hall, turning again and immediately pressing himself to the wall. He took in deep breathes through his mouth, closing his eyes and forcing calm into his blood stream. John will be just fine... Sherlock opened his eyes and took in his surrounds with detail. The wall that had been separating two different apartments had fallen down and the ceiling was sagging in the middle, threatening to let loose its insides .He jumped over a few pieces of furniture and trash and found a rickety table leaning up against a wall. Show time Sherlock felt himself fall onto the surface with a thud ...I should work on softer landings. AShape shifting was weird in the way you didn't feel much different than when you were a pen or a full grown man. He could see the same, maybe better and the sound of pounding feet on stairs. Minutes passed and worry was making Sherlock sick. Finally, the sound of footsteps turned down the hall that he was sitting in. A group raced by, scowering the room and flipping over a few pieces of furniture before moving onto the next collapsing room.ASherlock breathed a sigh of relief (though he didn’t really have lungs or a mouth or a diaphragm) and stayed put, waiting for the sounds of footsteps to dissipate. He hoped against hope that John had found a decent hiding spot and stayed there. The fact the group wasn’t carrying an around a man in a jumper was a small relief and Sherlock tried to stay as optimistic as logically possible. AMinutes passed and he was about to change back when he heard a lone pair of trudging footsteps down the hall. They turned down Sherlock’s hall and he saw John, relief flooding his form again.  Just wait till he moves on then catch up... APlans changed when John’s eyes settled on his exact spot and he was filled with confusion. ""Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?"" John scoffed, squinting his eyes at him. Sherlock froze and didn't speak as John trudged over to him. “Why are you sitting on a table?"" ASherlock was petrified and very confused. John wasn't supposed to be able to see anything other than a normal pen sitting normally on a normal old table. A""Sherlock, seriously, what the hell, how is that table even supporting you weigh, I-"" A“John, I'm a pen, you're not supposed to be able to see me.""

Years later, that meeting gives him a safety net to cling to when everything goes to shit and he gets shipped home from war broken, traumatized and uncertain whether he'll ever be ready or capable of bonding again.","All things considered, the outfit really wasn't that bad. John stood in front of his bed and surveyed the seemingly innocent-looking clothing with a critical eye, trying to find something that he could complain about. The trousers were a dark blue that looked black in some lights and were a little bit tighter than what he normally wore, but it wasn't worth picking a fight over. Even the shirt, which was a lighter shade of blue, was actually of a very nice quality, and so were the black leather shoes. He scowled, nearly ready to concede defeat... until he noticed something.He pushed the right leg of the trousers aside. His mouth dropped open and a strangled squeak emerged at the sight of the bright blue pair of women's knickers underneath. They looked to be made of silk, with a little bit of white lace around the waistband. The price tags were still attached, so at least they were new, but that made him no less inclined to touch the silky scrap of fabric. He sputtered for several seconds before spinning around to face the door and shouting a very indignant, ""Harry!""""What?"" His meddling sister poked her head into the room a moment later, all innocence. ""Don't you pretend you don't know what,"" John snapped, pointing a finger at the offending underwear. ""Why are your knickers on my bed?""""They're not mine. Do you really think I'm big enough to wear that size?"" Harry was frowning now, a dangerous glint in her eyes, and John floundered. He'd rather go off to war tomorrow than face Harry when she was in the middle of feeling like she was fat... particularly when the bout of insecurity would be his fault.""I didn't look at them closely enough to be able to tell,"" he said quickly. ""Oh. Why not?""""Because they're knickers!""""They're nice knickers,"" Harry countered, pushing her way into the room fully and reaching for them. She rubbed the material between her thumb and index finger and sighed. ""God I love the feel of silk. There's really nothing else like it. I'm telling you, Johnny. To get a hot guy to come home with you tonight, all you need to do is wear these and let your target cop a feel. You'll have your pick of the litter.""John resisted the urge to palm his face just barely. ""Harry, I don't want anyone to come home with me,"" he said wearily, wondering why he'd even bothered to open the door. Oh wait, that was right. He hadn't opened the door. Harry had stolen his key right after he moved into the flat and made herself what had to be several dozen copies, as no matter how many times he took a key back from her she always had one to spare. ""Come on, you're going to war. Who knows when you'll have the chance for sex again?""""No,"" John said, crossing his arms. Had it been anyone else, he might have been swayed into the idea of going to the pubs fairly easily. He did enjoy a good night out every now and then - as long as the knickers got tossed in the bin where they belonged, of course. But not with Harry. Being around alcohol was just too difficult for her right now, too liable to cause a backwards slide that could result in her ending up right where she'd started. He couldn't ask her to go to a pub and not drink, mostly because he didn't think she'd be capable of that.Harry looked at his face and then pouted, idly twirling the knickers around her finger. ""You're such a spoilsport, John, honestly. I try to do one nice thing for you -""""You're trying to get me to dress up like a girl!""""- and you act like it's the end of the world. Which, God, it's a pair of knickers not a corset and heels. And they did have those in your size, so just be grateful I restrained myself as much as I did.""John just stared at her.She tried, and failed, not to snicker. ""I need to get a decent camera for moments like this. The faces you make are just too priceless.""He rolled his eyes and snatched the knickers away from her with a rude sound. Only Harry would be willing to spend nearly twenty pounds on a joke. He threw them in the general direction of the bin. ""I'm glad that you want to spend time with me tonight,"" he said as patiently as possible, because it was the truth. Their relationship had been rocky for a while there, and he didn't want to leave while they were on the outs. ""But not in a pub. Why don't we stay here and I'll order a pizza? You can ask Mum to pop 'round if she wants.""""Mum's busy tonight, and you're not getting out of this that easily. So help me you are going to do at least one fun thing before you leave,"" Harry said firmly. ""It just so happens, I figured that you would say no to going out to the pub so I came up with something else we can do.""""What?"" John asked, suspicious. It wasn't like her to give in that easily. He'd been half expecting her to put up quite a fight about not getting the chance to test herself against the struggle to remain sober. Harry was like that. Even if it was almost a certainty she'd lose the battle, she couldn't resist the challenge.""I'll show you. Put on your clothes.""Before he could argue, she zipped out of the room and threw the door shut behind her. John sighed and let the towel he'd been clutching around his hips drop to the ground. He pulled on a pair of his own pants before he slipped into the trousers, which - after a quick perusal in the mirror - he had to admit clung to his arse nicely. The shirt fit well too, showing off just a hint of the muscles he'd developed. When she wasn't making a total pest of herself, Harry did have good taste.He slipped some socks on and then the shoes before he ventured out into the kitchen. Harry was sitting at the table. She'd changed too, into a summery skirt and tank top which wasn't her typical kind of outfit and set off alarm bells in the back of John's mind. He stopped in the doorway and frowned, not buying the innocent smile she was wearing for a second. She was planning something and he had the sinking feeling that he had just allowed himself to play right into it.Without saying a word, Harry spread a few glossy photographs over the table and gave a grand gesture. John approached and glanced at them, realizing that they were all pictures of tattoos - gorgeous tattoos, at that. Each one had been done with care, gentle black lines traced lovingly across the flesh backdrop. And the colour... it was so exquisitely detailed so as to make him wonder whether he was really looking at a tattoo or if the artist had been armed with paints instead. Harry's smile had widened into a grin during his silent examination of each photograph, and now she leaned forward and clasped her hands together. ""His name is Sherlock. He and his partner own a tattoo shop together. People come from all over the world to get a tattoo done by him. He's really clever. He gives you the tattoo he deduces that you want, not the one you ask for.""""Sounds like a gimmick,"" John said, though he had to admit he was intrigued.""I've researched him pretty thoroughly online. Loads of people complain about his attitude, but his work gets rave reviews."" Harry touched the top of one photograph John held. It was beautiful, pale pink flowers rising up a green stem against dark skin. ""This woman said she wanted to punch him in the face several times during the appointment, but she loved what he did and might even consider going back.""""How nice for her. I'm not sure what this has to do with us.""""I want to get a tattoo,"" Harry said flatly. ""I've been sober for three months now. It's... that's the longest I've gone without since Dad gave me a beer when I was nine."" She fidgeted, drumming her fingers nervously. ""Bit of a milestone. I was hoping that you would come with me and get one at the same time.""Damn. John dropped his eyes back to the photos and took a deep breath. He wasn't thrilled at the idea. Needles didn't bother him, of course, but he wasn't sure he liked the thought of something being etched permanently onto his skin. But at the same time he wasn't sure how he was supposed to say no when Harry was looking at him so hopefully. For once, he could tell that she was being honest about this: it meant a lot to her. And if it would be something to keep her sober...He sighed. ""Maybe we could go look at the place.""""Great!"" Harry's eyes lit up and she jumped to her feet. ""I'll call a cab.""""Wait, now?""""John, you ship out Friday. There's no time to waste.""""But..."" John's head was spinning. He needed time to get used to this first. ""Don't you typically need an appointment for this kind of thing?""Harry pretended she couldn't hear him, too preoccupied with calling the cab company. ""They'll be here in ten minutes,"" she announced.""Harry.""""So we'd best get ready!""""Harry.""Her shoulders dropped and she bit her lip. ""I made us both appointments weeks ago, as soon as I knew you'd got notice to join,"" she admitted. ""It ended up working out really well... for a while there I was worried that you would ship out before. It's really hard to get a spot. As it was, I managed to get you in with Sherlock but I had to go with his partner.""""I'm not promising anything,"" John said, because what more could he say? Harry had always been like this and she always would be. Most of the time he didn't mind standing up to her, but with the added knowledge that this had been months in the planning... he just couldn't. ""For one thing I don't even know what I'd get.""""Don't worry. Like I said, Sherlock deduces the tattoo that you want."" Harry patted him on the arm and grabbed her coat.""What does that even mean?"" he muttered, shrugging his own jacket on when she threw it in his face. He followed her downstairs and they waited on the pavement in silence for the cab to show up. Harry was practically bouncing on her heels with excitement, and he knew that as far as she was concerned the whole tattoo thing was a done deal.The second they were in the cab Harry rattled off an address that wasn't very far from John's flat, though he had to admit that it wasn't in a part of town he normally frequented. He watched out the window as the shop came into view. It was very understated, looking much like any other tattoo parlour. There were huge glass windows to let people see inside, and the walls were lined with more of the gorgeous artwork Harry had shown him earlier.

Fortunately, as he was positive that his army mates would never let him live it down once they found out, Harry seized his arm and physically dragged him into the parlour. Her hands were shaking with excitement, and as the door swung gently shut behind them she looked around with an expression more suited to a toddler on Christmas morning.Larger on the inside than it appeared on the outside, John was surprised to see that the place looked… normal. Somehow his imagination had conjured up a seedy sort of place with the chairs and equipment right out in the open and possibly inebriated, heavily tattooed men surrounded by buzzing needles. But instead there was a large desk right smack in the middle of the room and more of that gorgeous artwork on the walls, and while he couldn’t see into the back because the doors were closed it could’ve been a dentist or doctor’s office, even.Harry finally released his arm so that she could sidle closer to the walls, staring with rapture. “God, could you imagine being this talented?” she asked in a hushed voice, reaching out to brush her fingers across a photograph of a tattoo depicting a naked woman sunning herself on a rock. The lines were much sharper, almost jagged, than the pictures John had seen before, but no less stunning. “Not really,” he said honestly, folding his arms. He wasn’t really clever at much. It was one of the reasons why he’d gone into medicine in the first place. That was more about cold, hard logic and memorized facts. Plus, it was one of few fields where both sentinels and guides were highly valued. While sentinels excelled at surgery, guides were known for both their nurturing gifts and ability to keep people calm under pressure, which was obviously a huge bonus when it came to treating injuries and keeping shock at a minimum.“Oh, come on. You say that like you’re not good at anything,” Harry said, turning around and rolling her eyes. “How many guides are accepted into the army? Next to none, even though you guys are like... ideal for treating wounds on the battlefield. You had to pass all of those ridiculous tests just to prove you could do it. Not many people would have the patience for that.”“The tests weren’t ridiculous,” John protested feebly, mostly because he privately agreed. The tests for guides were way more stringent than the ones for sentinels or humans, including psychological testing that had raked him to the core. It was strange: on the one hand, guides were the tethers that kept sentinels from succumbing to a zone and that no easy task. But on the other hand, people considered them delicate and fragile, apt to shatter at any moment, particularly when it came to something as traumatizing as a warzone.John couldn’t stand that kind of attitude. Joining the army had always been a dream of his, though one he’d never thought he would actually be capable of attaining, and he knew he would be better at being a soldier than people realized. Finding out that he could do so through medicine – because there was always a need for medical personnel on the front – was just a bonus. He would’ve gladly gone through any test, no matter how inane, with a smile on his face for the dual opportunity, especially since the army was willing to fund the entire thing.Harry gave him a critical look but said nothing more on the topic as one of the back doors finally opened. An older woman came out and stopped short at the sight of them. She was probably in her late fifties and she was not at all the kind of person that John would’ve associated with a tattoo parlour. For one thing she didn’t have any tattoos, and for another she was dressed as neatly as the office workers that John used to share his early morning commute with.“Hello dears,” the woman said in a kindly voice, walking over to the desk. “Have you an appointment?”“Yes,” Harry said. “Harry and John Watson.”She reached under the desk and pulled out an appointment book briefly. Flipping it open, she studied it briefly and then nodded. “Here you are. I’ll just fetch Irene and Sherlock. It won’t be long.” She smiled at them both. “I’m Mrs Hudson. If you need anything, just let me know.”“Thank you,” John said to her back. She moved fast for an older woman. He sat down to wait while she was gone, though Harry seemed to be too nervous to sit. She paced back and forth, continuing her examination of the wall, stopping only occasionally to comment on a piece.He was the one to look up first when the door opened again, and right away he knew exactly why Harry had been so anxious to come here tonight. Or at least one of the reasons. Because the woman walking into the room was absolutely gorgeous. She was tall with dark hair wound back in a bun, leaving just a few curls to escape and brush her shoulders. The clothing she was wearing – a black pair of jeans with a green tank top – wasn’t overly revealing, but somehow it seemed like it was when paired with the dark stiletto heels.“Mr and Mrs Watson?” she asked.“It’s Miss,” Harry corrected before John could get a word in, and John recognized that gleam in her eyes. Harry was totally smitten, probably before she’d even exchanged a word in person. John had to hold back the sigh. It was so like his sister to be willing to get something permanent inked onto her body just for the chance to be near the artist for a few minutes.“Oh, you’re siblings?”“That’s right. This is my brother John, I’m Harry and I’m guessing you’re Irene.”Irene smiled, finally, her bright red lips parting to reveal straight white teeth. “That’s correct. Come on. I’ll show you into Sherlock’s room on the way by, Mr Watson.”It was a good thing John hadn’t planned on having his sister there next to him when he got his tattoo, because Harry couldn’t wait to get rid of him. He stared at their retreating backs and shook his head with amusement, wondering if Harry would end up with a date out of the situation. It wouldn’t be the worst thing if she did; she hadn’t dated anyone since she’d got sober, since most of her old friends were still firmly on the wagon and Harry didn’t deal with meeting new people very well.He turned around to enter the room Irene had pointed to and stopped short, nearly swallowing his tongue at the sight of the man already inside. Keen blue-green eyes surveyed John from where the man was sprawled across a couch tucked against the far wall. Those eyes were nearly hidden by the mess of dark curls that hung haphazardly over his face, but evidently he could still see John well enough because his mouth opened and a rich, deep voice spilled out the following:“You’re in the army, unusual for a guide like you, but I can tell by the way you hold yourself that you’re stubborn. Army loves traits like that, particularly if guides take orders well, and I imagine you do. You’re more worried about going to Afghanistan than you want to admit, mostly because you fought so hard to be accepted in the first place. Not just about your sister, though that is part of it, but about yourself as well. You’re not sure you’ll be able to handle what you’re about to face.”After he’d processed the words, which did take a few seconds, John took a step into the room. “I’m guessing you must be Sherlock,” he said evenly. “And you’re mostly right, except that I know I’ll be able to handle anything the army can throw at me.” He crossed his arms, refusing to admit that Sherlock was half-right about him being worried: only it wasn’t the casualties or wounds. He had the training necessary to handle that. It was the sentinel he was going to be paired with that gnawed at the back of his mind.Sherlock eyed him for a few seconds before settling for a concise nod, apparently not willing to argue the point. He stood up gracefully, unfolding from the sofa in a way John could never hope to emulate, and said, “Shut the door. Sign those. Then take your shirt off. Sit with your back facing me.” He pointed to a chair.Arguing didn’t seem to be worth the effort, so John obeyed. After all, he was there to get a tattoo. He glanced over the papers, realizing that, among other stipulations, it was a contract that forbade him from suing if he didn’t like the design he ended up with. He sighed but signed, then folded his shirt and set it aside. The chair Sherlock had indicated had a padded back, and it was surprisingly comfortable to straddle it so that his shoulders faced the room. He rested his chest and belly against the padding, sensing Sherlock behind him, and tried to prepare for the first light touch of fingers across his back. He failed, shivering at the gentle brush.“What are you going to do?” he asked.“Shh. Be quiet.”The whispered admonishment left him speechless. He silently listened to the sounds of Sherlock prepping his station. The initial touch of a sterile cloth against his flesh made him jump, but he quickly went lax again when the cloth paused pointedly. Sherlock seemed to have decided on the back of his left shoulder as the area for the tattoo, as he quickly shaved the area and then cleaned it again.Then there was a long period during which he didn’t hear anything but the quick scribble of pencil across paper. He listened and tried not to wonder too deeply what kind of design that Sherlock had decided on, even though curiosity was burning through him. Sherlock stood up and walked away, returning a moment later to press something against John’s shoulder. The heat of his hand felt more intense this time and John barely kept himself from shivering again. After the paper was peeled away, he heard the low buzzing of the needle. His fingers clenched into the fabric of the chair and he grimaced when it was touched to his skin. It stung, though not as badly as he had expected. It felt a little like a cat with very hot claws was deliberately scratching him. Not unpleasant, but not unbearable. He shifted a little and then relaxed.As he grew used to the sensation, he became aware of other stimulation. The sensation of Sherlock’s fingers brushing over his skin, pulling the flesh taut and wiping away blood and ink. The feel of Sherlock’s breath washing over his neck and ear, because the artist had leaned in close in order to fully concentrate. He tried not to think about it, wanting to squirm at the idea of being trapped under so much scrutiny. So much focus. A sentinel was capable of seeing far more deeply than he was comfortable with. He could only hope Sherlock would be willing to exercise discretion. The needle drifted sideways towards his spine and he sucked in a breath at the renewed sharpness of the pain, fighting the instinctive urge to move away. “That burns.”“Be quiet.”John sighed and gave up the idea of holding a conversation, instead resting his head against the padding and letting Sherlock work. In spite of the pain, there was something peaceful about sitting in an enclosed room with a sentinel. A sense of safety, of belonging, that he wasn’t accustomed to, one that sank into him and took hold in his core like Sherlock’s touch was transmitting the message to his body. He hoped that the sentinel he would be paired with by the middle of next week would feel the same.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

John held back the sigh as he reached out and gathered her into a hug, exchanging a glance with Harry over her shoulder. Harry just shrugged and made a face, caught somewhere between apology and a grimace that strongly suggested this was not the first bout of tears that she’d seen that day.“Mum, really, it’s going to be fine,” John said, giving her a quick pat on the back as she sniffed against his chest. This was exactly why he’d balked at the idea of a going away party in the first place, but Watson women were notoriously hard to say no to and his mother and sister were no exception. He had managed to say no the first couple of times the idea was brought up, but after that the decision had been taken out of his hands and he’d basically been told where and when to show up.“I know. I know and I’m sorry.” Olivia took a deep breath and straightened up, dusting the remaining tears from her eyes. “It’s just… every time I think about my baby out there, it hits me all over again how much danger you’re going to be in.”“It won’t be that bad,” John told her, already knowing it was useless. No matter how many times he explained that he wouldn’t be seeing much battle because he'd been trained as a doctor, that even though he was paired with a sentinel he would never be on the frontline, Olivia was convinced that he either wouldn't come home or that he'd be injured in some way. She had never outright forbidden him to go, but she’d made it clear that she wasn’t pleased with his choice.Even now, she grabbed at his arm. “You don’t know that!”“Mum, let him come inside,” Harry said, finally pulling the door open a little wider and gesturing for John to enter. “People are going to be arriving soon and they'll start to wonder if you two are standing out here. And you need to check on the turkey, I think I smell something burning.”As their mother took off towards the kitchen, Harry hissed, “You owe me.”“I owe you nothing,” John said, pointedly rotating his shoulder. The tattoo still ached a bit, particularly when he fell asleep and thoughtlessly rolled over on his back as he sometimes did. It was a little like having a bad sunburn, especially when he had to wash it in the morning. He wasn’t looking forward to how much it would sting during the first couple of days after he had to carry a few stone of equipment on his back.Harry pouted. “That’s different and you know it. I had to spend the whole week with her. She keeps crying and saying how she wishes Dad was here, even though it wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference because he'd have applauded you. She brought out our baby pictures for God’s sake! A little pain is nothing compared to that.”He grimaced, conceding the point, and followed Harry into the kitchen. There was a veritable feast already waiting for them, not including the huge turkey that Olivia was hoisting onto the table. She slipped her oven mitts off and said, “John, why don’t you carve before people start to arrive?”“Sure, Mum.” He accepted the knife he was handed and set about taking the bird apart, his stomach growling hungrily as he worked. It would be a long time before he had another meal like this and he planned to savour it, though his mother’s eagle-eyed vision meant that he didn’t get the chance to sneak many pieces. She slapped his hand twice, though she was fighting a smile both times.“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” she asked quietly.John glanced around, realizing too late that Harry had slipped away to man the door. He focused on the turkey. He’d prepared himself to have this discussion one last time, but that didn’t mean he wanted to. “We’ve talked about this before. It’s too late for me to change my mind now.”“If you really wanted to get out of it, you could.”“But I don’t.”“I just… John, you’ve been shielded all your life. No, don’t argue.” Olivia held up a hand. “Just listen. It’s the truth. When your father and I realized that you had inherited… that you were a guide, we did everything we could to give you a normal life. Particularly once the Foundation discovered that you had the potential to be able to bond with a sentinel. They approached us several times, you know, trying to get us to send you to them, but we wanted you to have the choice about whether you ever wanted to pursue that part of your life.”“I didn’t know that,” John said quietly. The Foundation was where most guides and sentinels went to be trained in the use of their abilities, but his parents had foregone that route and instead hired a personal teacher who had taught him everything he knew. It was infinitely more expensive than the free training offered by the Foundation, but he’d never really stopped to think about why they would’ve done that.He set his knife down and turned to face her. “Are you worried about me bonding?”“No. If that’s what you want, you have my full approval. I know that you were taught exactly what bonding means.” Olivia sighed. “You know that it leaves a lasting imprint and is extremely difficult to break at the very least. But I’m concerned about what it might mean for you in a warzone. You may not be on the front lines, but your sentinel likely will be. And if you’re close enough…”“I don’t think that sentinel and guide pairs that meet through the army ever get that close,” said John.“It could happen. It has happened, rare though it might be, and I’m your mother. I can’t help worrying about every possible outcome, especially because I’m the one who passed the ability to be a guide on to you in the first place.”“Mum, that’s not your fault. It’s not like you had a say in it. You know it comes down to chance. I’m a guide, Harry’s not. I have blue eyes, hers are grey. It’s chance. It could’ve been just as easily the other way around, or both of us, or neither of us.”Olivia shook her head. “It was still me and my family,” she said stubbornly. “Please promise me you’ll be cautious. They’ll push you to bond as fast as they can and I understand why, but don’t throw yourself into it. You need your shields to remain strong when you’re in the middle of so much pain and death. You can’t afford to let yourself become too vulnerable, no matter what the army says.”“But my sentinel will need me.”“I know. Just… think about yourself too.” She squeezed his arm. “You’re my priority, honey, not the sentinel the army picked out for you. I need you to become back whole and safe in every way, not just physically.”John nodded, a little troubled, and she smiled at him and went out to greet the guests that they could both hear arriving. He finished up with the turkey and put the knife in the sink, washing his hands slowly while he thought. He’d known, of course, that he would be paired with a sentinel the first day he arrived. Possibly even before, if his sentinel was coming from London too. So maybe even tomorrow.Now he not only had to worry about whether he would be capable of bonding with a sentinel, there was this. And the worst part of all was that his mother was right. The stories about guides or sentinels who returned from the war broken because of a severed bond were rare, mostly because the army worked hard to hard to hush those kinds of stories up. Sentinels were so valuable that no one wanted to dissuade them from choosing a career in any protective work, be it on the front or as a police officer or M16.But there were still stories, more rumours than anything, about what happened. After all, army bonds were rarely natural. They typically tended to be forced, which meant there was already something flawed about the very nature of the bond. So when they shattered, particularly when the guide or sentinel left behind was in an unfamiliar and dangerous place filled with pain and death, as his mother had so kindly pointed out, the results were… not pretty. He closed his eyes and focused on the panic that was surging through him, using the tactics that had been taught to him as a child to calm his body and emotions. He breathed out and eased up on the grip he had unconsciously taken on the counter, straightening up slowly. His tutor had complimented him on the strength of his shields several times while he was growing up, and even now he could tell that the conversation with his mother hadn't bothered anyone outside the room. He was not projecting, and nor was he picking up on anyone else.A quiet sound behind him, that of someone picking up a glass, made him spin. He drew back sharply against the counter in surprise when he realized that Sherlock was standing right behind him. Before he could say a word, Sherlock said, ""I felt you.""Of course he had. Sherlock was a sentinel, and he must have been a fairly strong one to have been able to sense that a guide not bonded to him was fluctuating their shield. John sighed, crossing his arms, glad that he'd drawn himself in before Sherlock arrived. ""It's fine. I'm fine. I was just having a discussion with my mother.""Sherlock made a face. ""You don't need to say anymore,"" he muttered distastefully, and John found himself smiling a little. ""She's not very pleased about me going to war,"" he said, because he didn't want Sherlock to get the wrong idea. Even though there was a good chance Sherlock had heard every word of the conversation, or been able to deduce it if he hadn't. ""No matter how many times I tell her it's too late for me to change my mind... I don't think the army would take lightly to that.""""No, they wouldn't,"" Sherlock said, and it was so matter-of-fact that John instantly liked him a little bit more. Everyone he'd spoken to who tried to convince him to change his mind was so sure that the army would understand, like it would be no harder to get out of deployment than it would to return a shirt to the shop. Sherlock was the first one to actually agree that it wouldn't be so easy, guide or not.""I suppose Harry invited you,"" he added, and then, realizing that sound rude, he continued, ""I'm glad she did. I saw the tattoo you gave me. Thank you. I like it.""Sherlock looked pleased. ""I hoped you would. I seem to get mixed reactions.""""I can understand why."" The tattoo John had received was a small, but incredibly detailed, version of the Guide Crest with his last name written in small letters underneath. It was stupid, made John feel ridiculous, but he couldn't deny that having it there made him feel like he was ready to go to war. Like it was the seal of approval he'd never received but needed to give him the courage to do this.""I do, though. Like it. A lot. You're talented.""""If you like it, you should come by the shop when you return. I'll give you another. No appointment necessary.""John looked at him and their eyes met. Something tugged in the vicinity of his chest, leaving him a little breathless, and he turned hastily away. ""Maybe I'll do that,"" he said quietly, even though he figured the chances of that happening weren't very high. ""I just might.""Sherlock nodded. ""Good luck, John,"" he said, and stuck out a hand. John shook it automatically, only realizing after the fact how awkward it was. Sherlock shook like he had no practice at it, like he only did it because he figured he was supposed to. ""Thank you,"" John said simply, and then Sherlock walked away and John went out to join the rest of the party.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

The last session he’d had in that stupid little room, all soft lights and white robed figures that blurred together into a smear, sometimes felt like an impression burned into his eyes. Patience, they’d whispered, the word a low, hated drum in the back of his mind. You’ll have to learn to be patient, to not be so quick to anger. The civilians won’t understand your frustration, and you could easily hurt someone by projecting if you don’t exercise caution until your shields are repaired.John stared up at the ceiling of his flat. It was white, which wasn’t doing much to improve his mood, and the sleepless nights he’d had since stepping foot on home soil were only compounding the problem. Ironically, even with everything that had happened while he was over there, he'd still slept better in Afghanistan. And it wasn’t because of the cocktail of drugs he’d been given, either. The distant sound of gunfire, the familiar thrum of other shields, the general mixture of adrenaline and exhaustion that permeated the soul… London was far too quiet.He sighed in disgust, giving any idea of sleep up as a lost cause, and sat up, swinging his legs down so his feet touched the floor. Sitting up so abruptly made his blood rush and the room swam around him. For a split second he thought he saw more of those damnable figures, and he caught a hand against the wall and sat very still until the room had settled into something slightly more recognizable. But only slightly. The cramped flat that the army had rented for him was still unfamiliar, still unwanted.It took effort to haul himself to his feet, made worse by the fact that he was mostly dependent on his right arm for his daily tasks. Everything took so much more effort. Even just the act of getting dressed, something which should have been easy, required him to rest afterwards. And he had to be so careful about what he wore now that the fingers of his left hand sometimes had a hard time with tiny buttons and he had difficulty lifting his arm above the level of his shoulder. Sometimes he thought that just sitting stark naked in his flat would be both better and more fulfilling.Because really, when he was finally dressed and the shooting pains running down his arm had eased, he had nowhere to go. Well, that wasn’t necessarily true. He just didn’t want to go, mostly because the thought of going to his appointment was not appealing in the slightest. He already knew what Ella was going to say: that he couldn’t let Afghanistan dictate the rest of his life, that he had to be willing to open himself up to new possibilities, that his life wasn’t over yet and a new chapter was just beginning.He didn’t believe a word of it and he was getting pretty tired of hearing it over and over. It wasn’t Ella’s fault. He knew that’s what she and all the other psychologists employed by the army were required to say. But just because she was a leading expert in guide psychology didn’t mean that she was right. Not in this case. As far as John was concerned, the bullet should have struck him a few inches over and down so that he wouldn’t be here to care anymore. Although, of course, he couldn’t exactly say that less he be locked up for his ‘own good’.The time for his appointment came and went, and his mobile phone began to buzz. Knowing that it was probably just Ella or her receptionist, he made no move to answer it. Eventually the buzzing stopped, but his phone was only quiet for a moment before it started again. He knew they wouldn’t stop. The calls would keep coming until he answered. Instead of giving in, he slipped his phone into his pocket and stood up. He pulled on a jacket, leaving it unzipped, and left the flat. It was cold and quiet outside considering the time of day. John huddled into his jacket and set as fast of a pace as he could, which wasn’t really very fast at all. His leg ached with residual pain, a slow burn that got worse the more he pushed himself. It would never serve to get him to his destination, which was the only reason he stopped and called for a cab. At least it wasn’t coming out of his pocket. The army was giving him a decent fund to live off, even if the money technically shouldn’t have been his.A cab finally pulled up and John got in, reciting his destination in a monotone. The cabbie seemed to sense he wasn’t willing to talk and didn’t speak, leaving only the radio to break up the silence. John just stared out the window at the fog, his leg and shoulder throbbing in tune to the beat of his heart. The doctors said he was lucky, that given time he would probably regain full use of his arm – but that it would probably always hurt a little even once it was fully healed, and that he’d never be able to block it out.He closed his eyes briefly. Of course he couldn’t. His shields were shattered, and it was only the medication he was on that kept him from either projecting on those around him or losing himself in the maelstrom of emotion that surrounded the average person. That was the whole reason why he was headed where he was, so that he could tell his mother that she’d been right to worry. The stories of the guides who lost their sentinels weren’t so very rare after all.“Here we are, mate,” the cabbie said finally, guiding the car to a stop. “You want me to wait?”“No. I’ll be a while.” John handed him a few bills and got out, straightening up stiffly. It was instinct to try and ease the tension by rotating his shoulder, but he’d been warned against doing so. The muscles weren’t in good enough condition for that yet.The grounds where Olivia Watson had been buried was small, on the very outskirts of London. It was surrounded by a wrought iron fence. The gate was open and John shuffled inside, his feet striking the brick path with a heavy thunk. He didn’t need to search for his mother’s grave, as he already knew exactly where she would be buried. Right beside her husband, in the plot Olivia had purchased for herself at the same time as she buried him. John had walked this path several times since that day, but he hadn’t thought he would do it for this reason so soon.He knelt down in front of the stone, pleased to see that Harry had done a good job. The area was being tended to, as evidenced by the fresh carnations that had been placed on the recently trimmed grass. He fingered the soft pink petals, feeling a pang of shame for not having thought to stop long enough to purchase a bouquet. His mind had been scattered recently, but that was something so basic for a visit to a grave that he was embarrassed. He cleared his throat awkwardly.“Hi Mum,” he said quietly, his voice hoarse from disuse. It sounded obscenely loud in the otherwise silence and he flushed. He hated the fact that he hadn’t been here, and no matter how often Ella pointed out that no one could have anticipated the car accident that killed Olivia and put Harry in the hospital for two weeks it did nothing to lessen his guilt. He sighed and rubbed his forehead, shifting in discomfort. “I know I should’ve come to see you before now, but I couldn’t. Guess I wasn’t ready until it meant I could put off another appointment with Ella.” He attempted a smile that failed miserably even as he chuckled. “God, if you were here you’d be so pissed at me for skipping.”She would have been, too. But then, if his mother had been there a lot of things would have been different. He cast his eyes back down to the grass and fisted his trembling hands. “I guess Harry probably told you what happened by now. Bill’s dead, and you were… you were pretty much right, Mum. I think I let him in too far and now I don’t have any clue what’s left.“Ella keeps telling me that it just takes time. She says that the tests they made me sit through prove I could still bond with the right sentinel. She wants me to go to the Foundation and ask them for a match. Can you believe that? I cut that off at the pass. Even if I did want that, you and Dad did everything you could to keep me away from them. I wouldn’t go to them now even if I was starving in the streets, and with what the army is paying me as a widower that’s not going to happen.”He fell quiet again. He didn’t like using that word, widower, even though it was stamped all over his files and had been repeatedly thrust in his face by the doctors and Ella alike. It implied something about his and Bill’s relationship which hadn’t been true. They were - had been - a match of convenience, not love, and Bill had a human wife that he’d loved very much. He’d made it clear from the beginning that he was not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with John.Since Bill’s death John had spoken to her only once over the phone at the insistence of a therapist, and he could tell that she had been absolutely shattered by Bill’s death.John just felt numb.He wanted to keep talking but he wasn’t sure what to say. Some things couldn’t be described in words, and what he’d gone through in Afghanistan was one of them no matter how hard Ella pushed him. Maybe if his mother had still been here, it would’ve been easier. But picturing her warm smile and the huge hug she’d given him before he got on the plane just wasn’t enough.The next few minutes passed in silence while John struggled to find something - anything - to say. He was almost relieved when he heard the shuffle of footsteps behind him. He turned his head just far enough to see that it was Harry standing behind him, holding two bouquets of carnations. Without a word, she knelt next to him and handed him the white flowers. Then she gently placed her bouquet of yellow on the grave. John hesitated briefly before he set down his flowers beside hers. They sat in silence for a few minutes before he finally said, “How did you know I was here?” “Ella called me. I’m listed as your emergency contact. She was worried when you didn’t show up for your appointment and didn’t answer your phone. I figured there wasn’t too many places you could be, and GPS tracking helped narrow it down a fair bit.” She smiled a little.Guess he should’ve expected that, though he was a little surprised that Harry had gone through the effort of finding him. He hadn’t spoken to her much since his return to London. She looked good, though. Better than she had when he left. She was almost two years sober now, after one harrowing relapse just after Olivia’s death, and time had served her well. “Will you come home with me, John?” she said quietly.“Why?”“Because I’m your sister, and now we’re pretty much the only family we have. Unless you want to keep staying where you are…”“No,” John said, maybe a little too quickly. He didn’t know if living with Harry would really work, but he dreaded the thought of going back to that cramped little flat enough to try. “No, I… if you’ve got the room, I’ll come.”Harry’s smile widened and she stood up, offering him her hand. “Good.”",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

Last time he'd returned home for a visit she was still living in the flat she'd found as a student. It was a decent place, head and shoulders above the cramped hole in the wall that the army had found for him, but he couldn't help being concerned about what it would be like for them to be right on top of each other constantly. That hadn't worked out so well for them when they were children, and he couldn't imagine it working any better now.But the flat that Harry took him to now was in a different, better part of London. It had two bedrooms and a good sized kitchen, and most of the furniture was new and the neighbours were actually quiet. She had food in the cupboard, locks on the door, the whole place was pretty clean and there was no beer or alcohol in the refrigerator. It was like meeting a whole new Harry and he wasn't sure what to think about her, because he never would have thought his sister could come this far.Maybe that was an awful way to think, but after the last time that Harry had relapsed... he'd seen it coming following the funeral, but there was just no way to stop it. Not when the army expected him to return overseas pretty much immediately. He knew better than most the statistics when it came to alcoholics who actually managed to remain sober and it was depressingly low, particularly when he factored in the loss of their mother. Olivia had been Harry's biggest supporter, encouraging her the whole through rehab and attending meetings with her unfailingly, and that loss was Harry's undoing.Harry walked in behind him just as he was shutting the door of the refrigerator. Her mouth was quirked into a faint smile. ""Are you convinced that I'm not secretly hiding alcohol, or would you like to check the cupboards again? How about my bedroom? You never know, I might be hiding whiskey underneath my mattress.""""You'd never cough up the money for a mattress of high enough quality not to feel it, and you don't have any bruises,"" John replied, straightening up and concealing his wince as his muscles protested. Kneeling on the ground for an hour had not done him any favours. ""We all know that you bruise if you so much as look at the side of a table wrong.""""Things have changed,"" Harry said pointedly.He took the hint, and even though he didn't really feel all that apologetic he still said, ""Harry, I'm sorry. You're right. I shouldn't have even looked.""""No, it's okay. I understand why you did. If our situations were reversed, I probably would have done the same thing. I just hate that you have to."" She looked off into the distance for a few seconds and then sighed, running her fingers through her hair. ""I'm the first to admit that I didn't handle Mum's death that well. I did go a little crazy there for a while. It was a bad time for me. I didn’t know how to cope so I turned to drinking the way I did when I was a teenager and Dad died.”She looked back at him, and her stare was unusually penetrating. “But that's all behind me, John, I promise. I’m sober again. Have been for a while now. I wouldn't have come around if it wasn't. The last thing I want to do is make this whole thing harder on you.” “You don’t have to worry about me.”“Actually, I think I do. You’re my brother, for one thing. And I might not know everything that happened while you were gone, and maybe I’m not a guide or a sentinel so I can’t really tell on a deeper level, but I have eyes. I can see what it did to you, being over there, and If I can help in any way I want to.”John dropped his gaze, unsure of what to say in the face of such honesty. Now he felt a little guilty that he hadn’t contacted Harry after he’d returned. Ella had encouraged him to, but he’d shot the idea down flat. With his shields torn to pieces, it was difficult to be around even normal humans – he couldn’t help picking up on their pain, their sorrow, even their joy – without running the risk of being around an alcoholic. Hard as it was to believe, though, Harry really did seem to have changed. “I’m not sorry I went,” he said quietly. “But… Mum was right.”“I never thought I’d hear you say that,” Harry said, and John huffed a dry laugh. There was a tight smile on her face, and she folded her arms across her chest like she was expecting him to say no. “What do you say? Are you willing to give living with me a shot?”“Can’t be any worse than where I am.”Harry rolled her eyes. “I’m beginning to think I should change my mind and not let you move in after all.”“No take backs,” John said automatically, pleased when she laughed for real. He’d forgotten how nice it was to talk to Harry when she was sober and in a good mood. It seemed weird now to think that he was the fucked up one and she was the one who had her life together. God only knew that the exact opposite had been the case for years. It was even weirder to think that he was going to have to follow her example.“Come on, I’ll show you to your room.” Harry led him out of the kitchen and down the hall, showing him to what was clearly the guest bedroom. It was very nice, pretty much the size of John’s entire flat, and decorated in blue and white. John looked around curiously, wondering what Harry was doing if she was able to afford a flat this nice in London. He was certain that it couldn’t be cheap.“We’ll have to go get your things,” Harry went on, moving closer to the bed and smoothing a hand over the quilt. “Whatever we don’t have room for, we can put in storage. I had to put some of Mum’s stuff away with what she was keeping for you while you were gone. I didn’t know what you would want to bin so I didn't go through any of it. We can store the rest of your things with hers until you’re ready to go through it all.”“Thanks Harry,” John said, suddenly grateful that he had decided to skip out on his appointment. This room was a thousand times nicer than what would have been waiting for him, and it wasn’t just because he was almost positive that the quilt on the bed was one that Olivia had crocheted. He could feel Harry’s honesty, her genuine desire to help, now that he was willing to open himself to it without prejudice. It left him warm in places that had been cold and empty for a long time.“Anytime, little bro.” She ruffled his hair, smirking when he swatted at her hand. “We’ll have to do the bulk of it tonight because I work tomorrow. You should come with me.”“Where do you work?”There was something slightly sheepish in Harry’s face when she said, “The Science of Tattoos?”John turned to stare at her in astonishment. “Seriously?”“What?”“How the hell did you end up there?”“I went back for another tattoo not long after you left,” Harry said defensively. “Irene is fantastic at what she does and she was willing to fit me in. What I wanted was a little more intricate so it took a couple of planning sessions, and in the process we got to talking and… we started hanging out, going for coffee. Then after Mum died, she was really helpful in getting me back on track. That’s when she offered me a job. And I wasn’t exactly going to say no. It was steady employment and she didn’t care that I'd dropped out of uni.”“Do you give people tattoos?” It was the only question he could think to ask. Somehow this felt like a lot to wrap his mind around, and he didn’t know why. Out of their family, Harry was definitely the only one he could imagine working at a tattoo parlour. But she had never been particularly artistic, so unless she had improved a lot…Harry rolled her eyes. “No. For your information, I’m apprenticing as a body piercer.”“A body piercer?”“It’s something else the shop offers and Irene’s the only one there who can do it, but she wants to focus more on the tattoo side. So when she offered to teach me, I said yes.” Harry tipped her chin up, a mulish expression he’d seen their father wear on more than once occasion settling across her face. “I went to a training course, too. Irene says she thinks I’ll be able to take over that side of things completely in the next year or so.”“So you…” John made a weak motion with his hands to signify a needle. “I pierce whatever the client wants, whether that’s an ear or a belly button or a nipple or” suddenly, she was smirking “their cock.”“Jesus, Harry!”She was laughing at him. “A lot of guys get it done. If you were interested, I bet Irene would let me give you the family discount.”“God no,” John said emphatically, cringing at the idea. He was too well versed in the dangers of infection to want anything near that part of his body, thank you very much. A tattoo was one thing, but Harry was never going to talk him into getting that done.“Baby,” Harry said affectionately, and she would have tousled his hair again had he not stepped back out of reach. “Seriously, though. You should come with me. I think it would be good for you to get out and see other people. By which I mean people who aren’t being paid to psychoanalyze you.”“I’ll think about it.”“Good. Do you want to head over to your flat now?”“Sure, I’ll be right out.” He followed her out of the room but paused by the bathroom door, letting her continue out into the kitchen. John stepped inside and closed the door, making sure that it locked. He used the facilities and washed his hands, marvelling at the fact that he actually had room to turn around, and then dried them carefully before he glanced into the mirror.The reflection staring back at him was not what John was used to seeing. It was not what he wanted to see. Sallow face, empty blue eyes, lank hair in need of a wash. His time in Afghanistan had given him a tan, but it didn’t look like it. He was too thin, too gaunt, now that even the muscles he had built up were shrinking after spending two months on forced bed rest and not doing much by way of physical labour even after his return to London. But that wasn’t even the worst of it.He hiked his shirt up as far as he could, turning his eyes away from the still healing wound on his shoulder. The flesh was puckered and shiny with soft, new pink flesh, the edges of where he'd had stitches still visible. He turned away, looking over his shoulder to see the back where the exit wound was located – because it had ripped straight through him, punched in and out and left him for dead. The bullet that had hit him couldn’t have been better aimed if the gunman had been deliberately aiming. His tattoo was gone.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

Harry didn’t even have to drag him into the shop this time; John was actually the first one through the door. He was surprised by how genuinely eager he was to see the calm interior that he remembered, the one so beautifully decorated with the tattoos that Sherlock and Irene had created.The room smelt of vanilla from the lit candles in the window in spite of how crowded it was. Harry took one look at the mess of waiting people and sighed, thrusting her bag into John’s arms before she pushed her way closer to the counter. “Alright. Alright, I said! Give me a minute to find the appointment book and I’ll gladly help you all out.”“I’ve been waiting for twenty minutes,” one man said, looking angry.Harry just shot him a look and ducked behind the counter, coming up with the book that John vaguely recalled seeing Mrs. Hudson holding. She began dealing with the clients one by one. As it turned out, most of them were waiting to ask for an appointment for a tattoo or a piercing, or to ask a question. Three young girls were waiting to see Irene, and there was an older woman waiting for Sherlock. Harry sent them on through the door. Everyone else was summarily dealt with and escorted out of the shop as quickly as possible.“Lord,” Harry said once the place was finally empty, a good thirty minutes later. She slammed the book shut. “I can’t wait until they hire someone else for this position. It’s really getting on my nerves.”“What happened to Mrs Hudson?”“She retired, and they’ve been searching for someone new for a while now but they haven’t found anyone they think would be suitable for the position. So in the meantime we’ve just been covering it as best we can. Mostly me. God knows Irene tries, and when I’m on shift I don’t mind being out there, but Sherlock hides in his room… He wouldn’t come out to help someone no matter who it was.” She blew a few strands of hair off her forehead and, finally, smiled. “Though maybe in retrospect that’s for the best. The last time he spoke to a client out here, he almost got punched in the face.”“Does that happen a lot?” John asked, raising an eyebrow.“More than you would think. Well, you would know. You had a session with him. You saw what he’s like.”John nodded, choosing to remain quiet on the subject rather than saying something incriminating. He and Harry had never really discussed what it was like to get their tattoos – although the next morning, John had been treated to a long lecture on why Irene Adler was practically perfect – and he found himself reluctant to admit that he hadn’t found Sherlock too bad at all. Sure, the man was abrupt and sort of rude. And he’d been kind of a prick and a show off, what with the way he’d instantly launched into deducing things about John that most people would have preferred be kept secret.But his fingers had been so very gentle, touching John’s flesh with the kind of care and attention that was typically unheard of for a sentinel. He may not have been interested in hearing John speak, but the comfortable silence that had eventually grown between them was soothing in its own way. He wasn’t used to being able to sit with someone and not feel the urge to break up the silence with empty chatter. In fact, after months of being subjected to hearing people talk at him, John could’ve used some more of that.Harry squinted at him suspiciously when he didn’t say anything, but shrugged her shoulders. “Anyway. I have to go talk to Irene about my shift today if we’re going to finish unpacking your stuff tonight. If anyone comes in, just yell for me and I’ll come back out.”“Okay.” He watched her head through the door, catching a brief glimpse of the hallway beyond before it swung shut behind her. There really wasn’t much for him to do after that, since there was only so long he could stare at the photographs on the walls. Beautiful as they were, within thirty or so minutes he was pretty sure he had memorized most of it.He wasn’t sure whether he should be grateful or not when a couple of people finally walked in. Both of them paused in front of the counter and stared at him with expectant looks, and right about then John finally clued in to what was, in all likelihood, his sister’s master plan. The talk about Mrs Hudson retiring and how difficult it was to maintain the front without help was not at all lost on him, not to mention the way she had attempted to get a feel for his opinion on Sherlock. She was trying to get him hired.Which meant that even if he yelled for her, she probably wouldn’t come. John sighed and forced a smile. “Can I help you?”“I’m looking for Sherlock,” said the guy, already glancing past John to the door. “He knows me.”“I think he’s with someone right now.”“Great, maybe I’ll be in time to stop him from getting punched again,” the guy said wryly. John quirked a smile. “I’m beginning to think that’s the de facto greeting for him.”“Might as well be. Greg Lestrade.” “John Watson.” John shook his hand and then watched as Lestrade rounded the counter and pushed through the door with an ease that suggested he’d been there several times before. He wondered if he should be stopping Lestrade from heading into the back, but then again – that wasn’t really his job, was it?“I’m here for a piercing,” said the girl still waiting, making his decision for him. “A nipple piercing, to be exact.”There was no way that the tips of John’s ears didn’t redden. He fought to keep from dropping his eyes to her ample breasts. “Um, sure. Just let me –”“I can take you right now,” Harry said. She had to have been listening behind the door all this time for her to have had such perfect timing, and John turned a glare on her. Harry pretended not to notice. “You wanted a nipple piercing? Right breast or left?”“Good God,” John muttered as the door closed behind them, suddenly deeply grateful that whoever had renovated the building into a tattoo parlour had paid for decent soundproofing. That was one conversation he really did not need to be a part of.He stayed up front more for lack of anything to do than because he had any real interest in answering the phone – though he did answer whenever it rang. For a modern tattoo parlour, Sherlock and Irene had an antiquated way of keeping track of appointments. At least the leather bound book was fairly simple to figure out. The front section was in blue and was reserved for Sherlock, and the back in red was for Irene. There was a tiny purple section in the middle for Harry. Up to a certain point the small, concise handwriting had to be Mrs Hudson’s, but after that it got a little out of control.Frankly, it was a mess. But considering that Harry had been the one keeping track for the most part, he wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d never been overly organized. It was the kind of book with removable pages, and he idly thought to himself that if it was his, he’d add new calendar pages and copy everything over… leaving out the crossed-out appointments and scribbles. At least make it look half-decent and more easily read than the disaster that it was now.He didn’t write anything down in the book, just kept track of who called and jotted it all down on a notepad. Clients were surprisingly receptive to the fact that they might have to wait months for appointments, though none of them seemed pleased when he said that he couldn’t actually schedule anything. One guy even tried to threaten him. Deeply amused, John just told him that he would have to wait until Irene was available and hung up. After what he’d been through, it would take far more than unoriginal threats to make an impact.About three hours after Harry deserted him – and either there was a separate exit or she’d spent most of the time snogging with that girl, because neither of them came back up front – the door opened and Sherlock, Lestrade and the guy who’d had an appointment with Sherlock came out. The guy was beaming and Sherlock didn’t appear to have any fresh bruises, so apparently Lestrade had arrived in time. It would’ve indeed been a shame for those cheekbones to be covered with a bruise… Amazing how Sherlock didn’t look any different from the last time John had seen him…Sherlock glanced at him and John dropped his eyes hastily, realizing he was staring.“Thanks a lot,” the guy said, and then he held out a wad of bills. Sherlock just stared impassively at his hand, making no move to take it, and after a few seconds of awkward silence John sighed and shuffled to the end of the counter. He took the money, set the bills down, and caught a glimpse of vivid ink on the back of the guy’s neck as he turned and left.“I see you finally hired someone new for the desk,” Lestrade said.“Actually –”“Yes.”They spoke at the exact same time and John stopped, speechless, as Sherlock continued, “It’s a recent hire, Irene’s doing. He’s not trained yet. But he will be.”“I didn’t agree to that,” John protested.“You accepted the money,” Sherlock said, like that was somehow a binding agreement, and Lestrade chuckled as John sputtered. “C’mon, you can walk me out.” He nudged Sherlock in the ribs with his elbow and Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he followed Lestrade to the door. John couldn’t help watching them go. Lestrade reached up to a clap a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder as they walked out, squeezing tightly, and then he left it there as they stepped onto the pavement. It was another gesture that spoke of just as much familiarity as when he’d walked around the counter, but with more… possessiveness.No matter what people said about his personality, Sherlock had at least one friend, then. Or maybe more. He leaned against the counter, unable to imagine a man like Sherlock allowing just anyone to put a hand on him. For a tattoo artist that spent most of the day with his hands on other people, John hadn’t taken long to notice that he was surprisingly shy about letting people touch him. It would have to be someone special. Someone like a boyfriend, maybe, or even a lover.He was surprised and discomfited by the burn of jealousy that shot through him. He wasn’t interested in guys. John Watson was not gay. Sherlock was just interesting, that was all. He turned back to the money and jumped about a foot in the air when he realized that Irene was standing at the end of the counter, watching him with a small, entirely too knowing smirk on her face. She just threw her head back at his reaction and laughed.“You’re hired.”“I didn’t –”“Sherlock likes you, Harry likes you, you seem competent.” Irene glanced quickly over his notes and nodded. “Though honestly, even if you weren’t I’d still hire you just because you get along with that idiot.”“You don’t even know me,” John said, frustrated. There’d been no interview, no background check. And he wasn’t sure he wanted a job here.“You can start tomorrow,” Irene said with an air of finality, like he hadn’t even spoken, and smiled.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

He has no idea that meeting tattoo artist and sentinel Sherlock Holmes will change his life. Years later, that meeting gives him a safety net to cling to when everything goes to shit and he gets shipped home from war broken, traumatized and uncertain whether he'll ever be ready or capable of bonding again.","In spite of John’s initial reluctance, he was surprised to find that he actually enjoyed working for The Science of Tattoos. It was a complete change from anything that he had done before, but nothing about the work was overly complicated: for the first couple of weeks, he made appointments, answered the phone, reorganized their filing system, and took payment for services rendered. But even though the work was not difficult, he found that there was something satisfying about it. After Irene discovered that he was decent with numbers, she also had him start doing some light accounting. John didn’t mind that at all. He liked being able to sit at the counter with the books open in front of him, keeping an eye on the storefront while also being available in case Sherlock, Irene or Harry needed him for anything. Numbers were straightforward and didn’t change. One plus one was always going to be two, and the gratitude in Irene’s face the first time he presented her with bills that had already been paid was more than enough thanks even without the small increase to his wages.He hadn’t mentioned it to anyone, not even Ella, but working at the parlour even helped with his nightmares. Most of the clients coming in were anxious and maybe even a little frightened, but they left excited and pleased with their new tattoo. John soaked those emotions up like a balm, drawing them closely ‘round himself like they could heal him from the outside in. It didn’t work, of course, but feeling something other than the consuming emptiness that had been there since Bill died was a godsend.One night just after the shop closed, he was still bent over the counter trying to figure out where some miscellaneous pounds had gone when there was a knock at the door. He looked up, squinting, and recognized Lestrade. The man had been a somewhat regular visitor, showing up every three to four days and spending a few hours in conversation with Sherlock. It was longer than anyone usually talked to Sherlock, John included, and he often wondered what they were talking about. He didn’t dare ask, mostly because he didn’t really want confirmation that Lestrade and Sherlock were dating. He wanted to know that bit of information even less than why the thought of them dating bothered him as much as it did. “Hang on,” John called out, sliding off his stool and walking as quickly as he could to the door. He unlocked it and stepped back, ushering in Lestrade and his companion, and glanced out at the pouring rain. “God, it’s miserable out there, isn’t it?”“Yes, it is,” Lestrade said, giving his head a shake and mopping water out of his face. “John, this is Molly Hooper. You’ll probably see her around a fair amount, she’s Irene’s guide.”John slammed the door a little too hard in shock, turning to stare at the woman in surprise. She was younger than he would have thought had he bothered to imagine, with long red hair pulled back in a ponytail and warm brown eyes. Molly’s smile was shy but welcoming as she drew her blue jumper closer around her body, and all in all she was not at all what he expected of Irene Adler’s mate. He barely acknowledged Lestrade slipping away, too anxious to see Sherlock to stand around talking. He was too fascinated by the first guide he’d really spoken to since he’d returned to London.“It’s nice to meet you,” Molly said finally. “You too,” John replied, gripping her hand gently. “I, uh, I didn’t know Irene was mated.”“We work separate jobs, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. I really don’t have any interest in tattoo work, I’m afraid. And I’m not sure anyone who was alive would trust me around them with needles. I can’t draw at all, not even stick figures.” She gave a little laugh. “But I’m close enough that if Irene needs me or vice versa, we can rush over. We compromise a lot.”“Your bond must be pretty strong to withstand you being apart for so long.”Molly shrugged. “It comes and goes. We room together, and so long as we spend enough time together at night and during lunch it’s not a huge deal. Do you have a sentinel, John?”Even though he should have expected her to ask, because of course she had picked up on the fact that he was a guide, the question still froze him to the spot. There was a beat of silence during which Molly’s smile started to fade as she sensed that she had asked a sensitive question, and he swallowed hard. “No, I – I don’t. Not anymore. I was in the army, and my sentinel…”“Oh God,” Molly said, looking horrified. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have – it was none of my business.”“It’s okay. I guess I should get used to talking about it,” John said, forcing a smile and hoping that Molly’s shields were strong enough to block out the renewed flush of guilt, self-loathing and pain pounding through him. “It was about six months ago. I was stationed in Afghanistan as a doctor and he was on the frontlines.”“You’re a doctor,” Molly repeated, seizing the change of subject like a grateful puppy. “Is that why you’re working at a tattoo parlour? You must have incredibly steady hands.”“Actually, I just do the work up front,” John told her, not wanting to get in to discussing his hands. His right hand was fine, but his left was another story entirely. Some of the nerves in his shoulder had been damaged when he was shot. Physical therapy was helping, but he was still years away from being able to do the fine scalpel work that he had been known for before he’d left.“Oh, you’re the new assistant! Irene’s been raving about you.”“She has?”Molly nodded. “She was telling me just a couple of days ago how much more smoothly the shop works with you here. It’s been an absolute disaster since Mrs Hudson left… They’ve tried to keep it together, but that’s easier said than done of course. I offered to help once or twice but I’m afraid my organizational skills aren’t really what they should be and I think I only made it worse.” She smiled sheepishly.“You tried, which is what matters.” He relaxed a little now that the uncomfortable part of the conversation had passed and turned back to the counter and his books. As he did, he noticed that the door to the back was open. Sherlock was standing there like he’d meant to come out into the room, but he was half-twisted so that he could speak to Lestrade. They were pressed so close together that John couldn’t help the spark of jealousy that tightened his gut.Sherlock’s head turned, his eyes immediately seeking out John, drowning out the sound of Molly’s voice in the background.“Sorry, what?” he asked, not looking away from Sherlock.“I asked if you enjoyed working here.”“It’s… it’s great.” Finally Sherlock let the door fall shut and John could look away. He did so instantly, turning his attention back to Molly. His stomach felt heavy. He hated the way that Sherlock was like a magnet, drawing John to him the second he entered a room. It was one of the reasons he had tried to keep his distance from Sherlock during the past few weeks, not that he was very successful. Sherlock seemed to delight in hanging around the shop long after it closed and Irene departed, leaving him and John the only occupants.They rarely spoke during those times, but against his better judgement John would prop the door open and he’d listen to the sounds of Sherlock preparing his equipment for the next morning. Sometimes that would be all he heard, but once – just once – there had been a violin playing. The sound was so exquisite, so lovely and pure, that John had stopped working and just stood there listening in a daze until it stopped. He’d been extremely late getting back to the flat that night.And when they did have occasion to speak, it was even worse. Sherlock could be cruel, deliberately so, in the way that he rattled off the deepest secrets of his clients like it was a game. But he was also impossibly clever and talented with both a needle and a bow, and he possessed a macabre sense of humour that matched with John’s perfectly. It wasn’t very often that you could find someone who would laugh at the idea of infection or skin rot. Plus the way he talked about the art of tattooing… it was astonishing. Just asking him a few questions was license enough for Sherlock to launch into detailed descriptions of the different kinds of tattoos and their colourful history – though he was careful to omit any mention of his own history. He just got so genuinely excited about it all that it was impossible to walk away. Here was someone who genuinely adored what he did for a living, and that was so rare. John was envious, in part because he’d never felt about anything the way Sherlock felt about tattooing.Sherlock was quickly becoming one of his favourite parts of the shop, and that worried John for reasons he did not want to think about.“John?”He jumped a little, nearly dropping his books on the floor. “Sorry, Molly. I guess I kind of zoned out on you there.”Her lips tugged into a smile. “Guess now you know how a sentinel feels.”John snorted at that, deciding that he would resume searching for the misplaced money tomorrow, and tucked his books away. “I somehow doubt that. When I have the kind of vision or hearing that Sherlock and Irene have, then maybe I’d know.”Molly just kept looking at him for a few seconds. “What?”“Do you like Sherlock?”The question wasn’t as unexpected as it could have been. Even Irene had asked once or twice, like she was worried Sherlock would say something to offend John and he would stew in silence instead of standing up for himself. He told himself that was how Molly meant it, too, and shrugged. “Yeah, he’s okay.”“That’s a better response than I usually get,” Molly said. “You know, I had a crush on him for the longest time.”“Really?” He didn’t meant to sound sceptical, but he had a difficult time imagining the woman in front of him with Sherlock. She seemed so quiet, so gentle. Against Sherlock’s more abrasive personality, he couldn’t see that working out well. He realized too late, as he often did, that Molly would probably be able to sense his incredulity. He opened his mouth to apologize, but Molly shook her head.“It’s okay. I know what you’re thinking and you’re right. I ended up meeting Irene instead. She and I are a much better match than Sherlock and I would have been. But Sherlock still doesn’t have a guide.”John could see where this was going. He shook his head. “No. Even if I was ready for that, I’m not interested in being a third. That’s… too difficult.”“It has good points,” Molly said quietly.Instantly he put two and two together: Harry’s continued infatuation with Irene, coupled with an introduction of Molly as Irene’s guide but not her mate, and felt like shit. It wasn’t unheard of for sentinels and guides to maintain a platonic relationship, particularly if their bond formed after one or both had been married. “God, Molly, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”“I get it, John. A lot of people think the same way. And someday when I find the right guy, I’ll be able to rub it in their faces.” She winked at him. “I’m just saying… maybe think about it.”“Yeah,” John said, mostly because he felt like he’d made things awkward enough tonight. Nothing would ever happen between him and Sherlock; he wasn’t like that and Sherlock already had a boyfriend. Enough said.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

By the time his brain woke up enough to clue in that it was actually Harry who was talking, she was already in the room and standing at the counter pouring herself a cup of tea. She turned around with a familiar, wicked smile and John fought the urge to groan. That smile never meant anything good.A“It’s too early for this,” he mumbled, propping his chin on his hand and blinking heavily. Sleep had not come easily to him during the past week, though for once the culprit wasn’t solely nightmares. In spite of his best attempts to put aside his conversation with Molly, parts of it continued to nag at him. He wondered how Harry felt about Molly and Irene.A“That’s your own fault for staying up too late,” Harry said logically, slinging herself into a chair and crossing one leg over the other. She eyed him for a moment, as though judging how quick his reaction time was likely to be, and then reached over to snag his plate, dragging it closer and surveying the remains of two eggs, toast and bacon with a greedy smirk. John tilted his head and watched as she forked up some of his eggs. He felt like he should steal it back, but that would require more effort than he could dredge up. All he could muster was a weak protest.A“That’s mine.”A“Sharing is good,” Harry said, licking her lips.A“You didn’t feel that way when we were kids.”AShe shrugged. “Anyway, you like him.”A“Him who?” he asked blankly, even though he suspected that he knew exactly who she was referring to. He was half-hoping that she would realize he was deliberately giving her an out and be courteous enough to take it, but then again this was Harry. She was stubborn enough not to take the hint.A“Sherlock.”ADread prickled down John’s spine and he hid his wince with a sip of lukewarm tea. “Harry, I really don’t want to talk about this.”A“Tough, because we’re going to. All I’m saying is, it’s not a bad idea. I like living with you, but you need a sentinel. Sherlock doesn’t have a guide. Plus, he’s an asshole but he’s exactly the kind of asshole you’d get along with. Trust me, I know your type better than you do. And he’s pretty easy on the eyes.”A“You’re gay.”A“Doesn’t mean I don’t have eyes. I can appreciate beauty in any form, thank you very much.”AJohn rolled his eyes. “Harry, come on. Sherlock and I aren’t even friends.”A“Whose fault is that?” She pointed her fork at him across the table. “Seriously, you guys were chummy for a while there but in the past week you've backed way off. Everyone’s noticed, which means Sherlock has too. I’m not trying to tell you how to live your life or anything, but I’m thinking that your grand collection of therapists would think it’s good for you to be making friends outside of the family. Especially with an unbonded sentinel. Can’t he, like, ground you or whatever?”AThe arguments that had been building on his tongue while she was prattling on died a quick death, and he ended up dropping his gaze instead. Technically, she had a point. Right now, John was damaged. His shields were crap and weren’t strong enough to protect himself, never mind pull a zoned sentinel back to themselves. But being around an unbonded sentinel would give him a point of focus and hopefully help him to relax enough to let the healing happen. ALike it or not, he needed a sentinel. He’d never feel whole again without one, not after how his bond with Bill had changed him. He just didn’t think he was ready for that yet. Losing Bill in combination with his own wounds had nearly killed him, and the only reason he’d survived was that their bond hadn't run deeply enough. Another couple years, though, and it might well have. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to lose a sentinel that was also a lover; he could understand why guides didn’t usually survive.AHarry was watching him closely as all those thoughts tumbled through his head, and now she leaned forward. “It doesn’t have to be anything more if you don’t want it to,” she said gently. “But you do know that if you did want more, there’s nothing wrong with that.”AOkay, now he really didn’t want to talk about it. John jumped up and dropped his mug in the sink. He grabbed his jacket and cane and practically fled the flat, ignoring the fact that Harry was yelling his name loudly enough to disturb all of her neighbours. She would be pissed and he’d probably pay for it later, but in the meantime he figured it was worthwhile to put the conversation off for even a few hours.AIt was late enough that the morning crowds were dispersed, but early enough that John had no trouble making his way to the shop. They typically didn’t open until noon, with the exception of Saturday. John didn’t mind. After years of getting up early every day for the army, it was nice to be able to get up and have a leisurely breakfast. Or at least, it had been nice right up until his sister started stealing his breakfast and chasing him out of the flat. AThe shop was quiet when he unlocked the front door, being that it was just after eleven, but that wasn’t a bad thing. Sometimes it was hard to focus on the books when there were a lot of people coming in and out. His belief that he was alone turned out to be misguided, though. As he took off his jacket and stuck it behind the counter, he heard the sweet sound of a violin.AJohn froze, not even daring to breathe as the lovely music spilled through the crack in the door and into the front of the shop. It sounded unbearably sad, the sort of music that you would expect to be played at a funeral, for a minute or two before it noticeably lightened. And as the cadence shifted, John exhaled and squeezed his eyes shut. All of the tension from his earlier fight with Harry was completely gone, forgotten in the wake of such hauntingly beautiful sounds. He wanted to listen to it forever.AQuietly, he got his books out and took up his place at the counter. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock knew that he was there and he didn’t want Sherlock to stop. It was amazing to think that one person could have the kind of hands that produced such amazing tattoos and music. He was, for a split second, filled with envy as he looked down at his own hands. At one time his fingers had proven steady enough to wield a scalpel, but now there were times when they couldn’t even be trusted to hold a pen.ASherlock played on for several minutes while John tried to concentrate, though more often than not he got lost in the music and his work lay forgotten. He had never been close enough to Sherlock to be able to watch the man while he was playing, but he found himself wishing that he could. He suspected that the harsh lines of Sherlock’s body would soften, because no one would played so beautifully would be capable of anything but caressing their instrument like a lover. He pictured the look on Sherlock’s face, the smile that would be on his lips, and found himself short of breath again.ASuddenly, right as the music climbed to a crescendo, it stopped.AHe waited, aimlessly drawing a little stick figure, for the music to begin again. But as the seconds ticked by and it didn’t, he grew concerned. He stood up and nudged the door open further, venturing a cautious, “Sherlock?”AWorking at the shop had taught him that it wasn’t uncommon for Sherlock to become so deeply entrenched in what he was doing that he didn’t hear when someone was speaking to him. God knew Sherlock lost himself in tattoos. It wouldn’t have been surprising if music was no different. Still, John couldn’t help stepping into the corridor and moving towards Sherlock’s office. The door was wide open, which gave him a view of the man sitting on the floor.A“Sherlock!” he exclaimed, louder this time. He knelt awkwardly, wincing as the pain in his thigh tightened and flared. Sherlock’s head was down, and when John reached out and gently tipped his chin up he saw that Sherlock’s eyes were dilated. His mouth was hanging open a little and his hands were still wrapped securely around his violin and bow. He didn’t react to John touching him at all.A“Fuck,” John said under his breath. There were plenty of things that could have caused this, but John had his suspicions. They were confirmed when Sherlock flinched like John had yelled at the top of his voice. He must have missed Sherlock’s reaction to his voice before in his difficulty in getting to his knees, because there was no mistaking this: a zone. It had probably happened because Sherlock was concentrating a little too hard on the melody of the music.AHe tentatively set a hand on Sherlock’s upper back, not so close to his neck that he would feel threatened but high enough that it might register. He was almost positive that this had happened before. About a week ago, right before he met Molly, Sherlock had been in the middle of a tattoo when the girl started yelling. John had jumped up and rushed into the back, nearly tripping over Harry in his haste. Irene had still reached Sherlock’s room before both of them, and she’d ushered the client out and closed the door in all of their faces. AIt was rare for someone other than a guide to be able to pull a sentinel out of a zone, but it was possible. He wished he knew what Irene had done. He thought about calling her, but his mobile was still tucked into the pocket of his jacket and leaving Sherlock was not an option. There was a certain window in which a sentinel could be pulled out of a zone, and if it wasn’t done in that span of time the sentinel’s mind could splinter entirely.ASwallowing hard, he tipped his head against Sherlock’s. “Can you hear me, Sherlock?” he whispered. “It’s me, John. John Watson. We work at the shop together.”AHis heart pounded a little harder when he realized that his words were now getting no reaction at all. He tried again, this time speaking a little louder.A“Sherlock, come on. You’ve got appointments in two hours, right? I don’t want to have to be the one to tell Irene that you can’t work.”ANothing. John chewed his lower lip, swearing internally. Even though he knew it was a mistake, he slowly let what remained of his tattered shields fall. Raw emotion flooded him and he gasped for breath, shaking at the onslaught. He’d been getting better, and he’d almost forgotten what it was like to be so overwhelmed. His voice trembled, barely audible, when he fought to speak. But this time, his every word reverberated with a pitiful trickle of power.A“Sherlock, please. Don’t do this. You’re so amazing. I can’t bear the thought of your mind being destroyed, and I don’t know what the shop would do without you. I don’t know what Irene would do, or... or me. You have to pull yourself out of this. Come on. You need to come back so that you can go on creating amazing tattoos. They’re so gorgeous. I’ve never seen anything like them. Please.” He kept talking, whatever he could think of, and cut off with a shocked yelp when Sherlock suddenly rose up and crushed John against him.A“W-what…” he stammered, trailing off as a nose nuzzled against his throat. Bill had done this a few times, during the worst of his zones. It was a way of reaffirming the imprint. He went still, even though he should’ve been squirming away because there was nothing there between him and Sherlock to reaffirm, because Sherlock's grip was so warm and strong.A“John,” Sherlock said after a couple minutes, and his voice was hoarse but steady.A“I… yes?”A“I want to give you a new tattoo.”",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

After all, Sherlock was the first sentinel that John had ever been in close proximity to while he was vulnerable. He’d been nervous about the tattoo and, though he was loathe to admit it, scared about being sent to Afghanistan, and there was an excellent chance he'd been unconsciously seeking comfort. John had to admit that at the time he might have opened himself up a little more than he should have, though of course not to the point where he was prevented from bonding with Bill.Still. Pulling Sherlock out of that zone hadn’t done anything to improve the situation. The difference should have been subtle, but to someone who had spent the last few months fighting just to get a moment’s peace from the constant bombardment of human emotion, it was enormous. When he was in close proximity to Sherlock, John felt better. He felt shielded, like there was a thin barrier between him and everyone else. It wasn’t even close to what Bill had done for him, but given time spent together intimately…He closed his eyes briefly and sighed, letting his head thud none too gently against the window. He was standing outside the dress shop that was just two spaces down from the parlour, trying to dredge up the courage to go inside. For a man whose skills were in incredible demand Sherlock had come up with an appointment that was much sooner than John really felt ready for, barely a week after the fact. Particularly when he knew that the smart thing to do would’ve been to call in and say he changed his mind, and then just walk away.Because he couldn’t do this. Not with Sherlock. Not without it going to places that John didn’t think he could ever be okay with. Sure it would mean upsetting Harry and leaving a job that he actually enjoyed, and he would have to pretty much cut ties with Sherlock and Irene and Molly, but that would be the smart thing to do.It was a shame that every instinct in his body rebelled against that.“Why did I do this to myself,” he muttered, punctuating each word with another thud. He was so confused and he had no one to talk to. He hadn’t told anyone what happened, though the scrutinizing look Irene had given him the next morning suggested that Sherlock had filled her in. And to be honest, John didn’t want to. He had his suspicions about what Harry would say, and going to talk to Ella about it seemed redundant. She’d pushed him enough about sentinels during previous sessions for him to know what her response would be.When he checked his phone, he saw the clock read 9:02am. Which meant that he was now officially late. He set his jaw and marched down the pavement towards the shop, deciding that he’d poke his head in the door and let Sherlock know he’d changed his mind. That resolve lasted right up until he got to the door of Sherlock’s room – because of course, Sherlock hadn’t bothered to respond to John calling his name from the front – and saw that everything was ready.Sherlock glanced over his shoulder from where he was standing beside the cabinet where he kept the majority of his supplies. If he was at all nervous, it did not show. His purple shirt and black jeans were perfectly pressed, and he looked as calm and composed as though he were about to tattoo a random client. “Close the door, John. And take off your jeans.”“Bossy,” John muttered, but found himself obeying. There was something calming about Sherlock's forceful nature that eased his nerves. He instantly felt a little better with the door shut and he took his jacket off, though he still hesitated to remove his jeans. “Why exactly am I taking off my clothing?”“For your tattoo,” Sherlock said very slowly, as though he was an idiot. John narrowed his eyes at the tone and scowled as he thumbed the button open. Sherlock turned away as he pulled his jeans  down, kicking his shoes off and stepping out. He folded his jeans and draped them over the sofa with his jacket, feeling a little silly standing there in just his t-shirt, boxers and socks. And no matter what Sherlock said, he was not prepared to take off anything else.He linked his hands behind his back and waited for Sherlock to finish, his racing heart slowly easing to a pace that didn't make him feel like he was going to throw up. It was strange. It felt like it had been at least a century, if not more, since he had last stood in this position waiting for Sherlock to give him a tattoo. And yet it hadn't been nearly that long. He wondered idly, as Sherlock finished prepping his station, whether he would've still gone to Afghanistan if he knew then what he did now. ""Are you nearly ready?"" he asked finally, certain that at least five minutes had passed. His anxiety all but gone, he found that he was getting bored. And cold. Irene kept the shop chilly.Grey-blue eyes flickered in his direction, a quick up-and-down that John was, by now, familiar with. Sherlock cocked his head slightly as though listening to something before he said, ""Yes, but you'll have to be horizontal for the placement of this one. Lay on your back on the table.""John frowned as he stepped forward. A sentinel's senses were fantastic, far beyond the range of the normal human, so there was no way for him to tell exactly what Sherlock had just been listening to. But he had a sneaking suspicion that Sherlock had been eavesdropping on his heart rate. Did he really need to fiddle with his station for so long, or had he deliberately been wasting time so that John would have the extra few minutes he needed to calm down a bit?There was no use asking Sherlock, of course, because even if that was the case Sherlock was hardly going to tell him. He hopped up onto the table, which was specially designed to be elevated to make it more comfortable for someone of Sherlock's height, and swung his legs up so that he could stretch out. Even with the thin layer of disposable material acting as a barrier, the table was freezing against his back and he shivered a little. Sherlock sat down beside him, pulling his chair up and scooting close so that he was leaning right over John's lower body. John jumped when he felt the initial touch against his right hip that turned into fingers sliding beneath the waistband of his boxers and gently rolling it down. He might have protested but for the fact that he could tell that nothing untoward had been uncovered and Sherlock's fingers were briskly business-like, not lingering, disappearing and then returning just as fast with a wipe to sterilize the area. He lifted his head just enough to be able to look down his body at the area Sherlock had focused on. It was just above his hip on the bottom of his ribcage, completely different from the location of his last tattoo. He wasn't sure whether he should be disappointed about that or not. At least with the last tattoo, it had been in a place that wasn't overly intimate. He was perfectly fine with Sherlock bending over his back for hours on end. This, though... this had the potential to be troublesome.""Your boxers are going to be ruined,"" Sherlock intoned, and John blinked up at him in surprise before his mouth quirked into a smile. Sherlock sounded like he was reciting something out of an instruction manual. He had to wonder how many people had come through this experience with stained clothing before Sherlock had been ordered to start saying something about it.""That's fine,"" he said, not bothering to admit that, even though he'd come here telling himself that it was with the purpose of cancelling, he had deliberately showered that morning and then put on a pair of clean boxers that were old but in good shape. He had to roll his eyes at himself then. If nothing else, he was very good at denial.""Alright. Hold still and don't move. I'm going to apply the outline."" Sherlock's hands were so very gentle as he pressed the thin sheet of paper against John's flesh, holding it in place until the ink had completely transferred. He peeled it off and then studied the drawing with a critical eye for several long seconds. ""Does it look okay?"" John asked, craning his neck again.Sherlock's head snapped around and he huffed, none too politely putting the palm of his hand to John's forehead and shoving his head back down. ""You know the rules; you don't get to see what it looks like until I'm finished. If you can't abide, I'm not above strapping you down.""A chill ran down John's spine and this time it had pitifully little to do with the temperature of the room. His throat felt too swollen to force a response and so he settled for a meek nod, desperately attempting to think of something - anything - but being tied down at Sherlock's mercy. The idea was both frightening and thrilling in equal measure, made even more so because there was a part of him that desperately wanted it.That part didn't care that Sherlock was a man, or that John didn't know if he was ready for another sentinel. It just wanted.If Sherlock noticed his distress, he made no mention of it. His attention was already focused on the process of the tattoo. He picked up his gun and switched it on, and the familiar buzz made John draw in a sharp breath of anticipation. He'd grown used to hearing it during his time at the shop, but it was a lot different when he could also see it being held less than a foot from his body. Then Sherlock lowered his hand, and John couldn't see it either.He tensed at the bite of the needle, realizing that his mind had done an excellent job of lessening the memory of the pain over time. Or maybe the place Sherlock had chosen was more sensitive this time. Either way, the prickly sting shot deep and he gritted his teeth. It was nothing compared to the pain of being shot, of course, but this was slow and deliberate, Sherlock's free hand stretching the cleaned skin like a canvas, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration as he worked.Realizing that he'd been holding his breath when his lungs ached, John breathed out and then back in. That helped a little. He forced himself to relax and focus on Sherlock's face and the minute changes in expression as the artist worked. Sherlock was actually very expressive, though it didn't take John long to know that it required a close study to understand. His forehead wrinkled when he didn't like how something was turning out. His mouth would twitch when he did. The crinkles at the corners of his eyes would deepen during a particularly tricky bit, and he would lick his lips in satisfaction when he succeeded.John watched him and drifted, the pain receding until it was distant and manageable. He fancied he could feel Sherlock's heartbeat through their slim point of contact and unconsciously began to breathe in tune with him, inhaling and exhaling at the same time. The tension drained from him for real this time, without conscious intervention on his part, and in turn Sherlock relaxed as well. He even glanced up briefly, their eyes meeting, and gave a tiny smile.Christ. The way his heart skipped in direct relation to that smile was a bit not good. John couldn't make himself look away even though he knew that he should, especially when the pressure of his shields eased. Alone, it was a little like trying to hide behind flimsy shields of sand. The granules of his fractured shields slipped through his fingers and it only got worse the more he fought to use them. But around a sentinel - around Sherlock - it was more like mud, still pitiable but more easily maintained.Given time with the right sentinel, his shields could be as strong as diamond.Given time with this sentinel...He closed his eyes and clenched his fingers in the fabric underneath him, doing his level best not to let on that he was affected by this in any way. Shit, he was in trouble.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

Then it was like that one little sound broke through John's calm, almost meditative state.Later, he wouldn't really remember leaving. It was like there was a disassociation between his mind and body. He blanked out completely, wasn't even sure that he conveyed his gratitude for the tattoo - couldn't have even said whether or not he bothered to say good-bye in his mad rush to get out of the room. When he clued in again, he was standing outside on the pavement. It was raining and he was clutching his shoes and his jacket in his arms, though - thank god - he was wearing his jeans.The last thing he needed was to get arrested for public indecency. Knowing his luck, he'd end up talking to Lestrade.He fumbled for his phone with hands that shook and sent a quick text to Harry telling her that he was ill and wouldn't be coming in that day. The thought of going back inside the shop to face Sherlock and pretend like nothing was happening was unbearable. His face flushed with embarrassment and shame every time he even thought about it. He couldn't believe how foolish he'd been to put himself back into that situation. There was something about Sherlock that kept him from being able to keep his guard up the way he wanted to, and that meant he needed to keep his distance until he figured out what to do about the sheer possibility lingering between them.And so it went that John Watson, the guide who'd been brave enough to go to Afghanistan as a doctor, called in sick for the next three days and holed up in his room at his sister's house like the coward he believed he was. He refused to answer the door for Harry when she knocked and ignored her when she tried to talk at him through the door. The unread text messages and un-listened to voice mails were building up on his phone, most of them from Harry and Irene, but John just didn't want to hear it. He wasn't gay. It didn't matter that his stomach tightened uncomfortably around Sherlock, or that he couldn't stop himself from watching Sherlock's mouth or his eyes when the man talked. He wasn't. John had been with plenty of girls in the past. He'd almost been married at one point; Mary, his girlfriend when he was seventeen, had been someone he'd wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Had they attended the same university, they would probably still be together now. But she'd wanted to travel, and last John had heard she'd ended up somewhere in Japan.Remembering Mary's blue eyes, her soft blonde hair and curves, was still enough to make a little jolt of arousal shoot through him. So there, not gay. Just... confused. The doctors had warned him that being left without a sentinel would be difficult for him, and Sherlock was the first unbonded sentinel he'd ever really spent time with. It was the guide in him trying to get close to a sentinel and nothing more... so what he needed to do was contact Ella, because she'd told him about all manner of ways that he could meet unbonded, female sentinels. And that would solve his problem. In the meantime, he just needed to keep his distance from Sherlock until he was more clearheaded.It would have been a hell of a lot easier to do that if he and Sherlock didn't work together, and if he didn't feel guilty about calling in sick when the shop obviously needed him. Reluctantly, on the fourth morning, he dragged himself out of bed after Harry left the flat and got cleaned up. He continued his habit of washing and moisturizing his new tattoo without looking at the ink, not wanting to see what Sherlock had given him, and then got dressed. It took a lot more effort than it usually did and he was exhausted by the time he was actually ready to go. He had to force himself to leave.The tattoo parlour was empty when he walked in the front door. John scowled when he took in the state of the front desk, which hadn't looked this bad in ages. Not since he'd taken over. His carefully tended appointment book was sprawled all over the place, pages falling out and covered in crossed out notes and scribbles. He muttered a few frustrated curses under his breath as he gathered the pages into a messy pile, realizing that he would need to recopy most of them. From the looks of it, Harry had taken her temper out on him by being as disorganized as possible. ""Bloody Harry,"" he mumbled, cringing at the sight of one of Irene's pages. She hadn't even used the right colour ink. ""I would think you'd be a little more pleased with her, seeing as how she covered for you while you were out.""John jumped, nearly knocking over the stack all over again. He hadn't even heard Irene's approach, but there she was standing not two feet behind him. She was as dressed up as ever, though this time her hair was down around her shoulders and face instead of up in the severe bun she typically favoured. He frowned a little at that, taking closer note of the light bruising under her eyes which was still visible even with the make-up she'd carefully applied. Even her clothing wasn't up to the usual standard, a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a simple sweater instead of the sexier apparel Harry was such a big fan of - though she was still wearing a pair of four inch heels. Heels, he noticed a bit nervously, that were more than capable of doing some damage.""Irene,"" he began, not that he was entirely sure what he was going to say. As it turned out, it didn't really matter.""Here's what I don't get,"" Irene said, steamrolling right over him like he hadn't even spoken. ""If you didn't want the job, if you really didn't want to be around Sherlock, you were free to walk out of here at any moment. I wouldn't have kept you here if I thought that you two weren't compatible, or that you didn't want this, because it was kind of inevitable that something would happen. And I realize that it's not really my business, except that Sherlock is my friend and you've been jerking him around with your mixed signals and I'm sick of watching what it does to him.""“My mixed signals?” John repeated, torn between being baffled and insulted. “Look, I can’t help the fact that my shields are broken.”“No, but you keep reaching out to Sherlock. You pulled him out of a zone. For God’s sake, John, the two of you are halfway to being bonded! I know you’ve been bonded before so maybe you can handle floundering around in this midway point, but Sherlock hasn’t. He can’t.”Something about the way she said that made him go cold, and he suddenly became very conscious of how quiet the shop was. “What do you mean? Where is Sherlock?”“He’s at home,” Irene said, crossing her arms over her chest and glaring at him. “You should know better than this, John. Sherlock in his mid-twenties. Most sentinels don’t make it to their thirties without bonding, particularly if they don’t have family or friends for support. I do what I can, but one person is just not enough. It was going to be difficult enough for Sherlock to find a guide before, but now that there’s this whole fiasco… I don’t even know if the Centre would be capable of helping him.” She shook her head, and for the first time John saw that she was afraid.Not that he blamed her. He knew the basics about guides and sentinels the way that pretty much everyone did; there were some things you couldn't grow up without learning. But some of the finer details, the things he would’ve learned at the Centre, had escaped him, and he didn’t always think about the world the way he was supposed to. In this case, he was aware that most sentinels who didn’t bond by their thirties slipped into a zone, but he had never put two and two together and come up with a chilling four.He felt sick to his stomach for an entirely different reason now. “What about Lestrade?” he asked a little desperately. “I know he’s not a guide, but surely he’s close enough to Sherlock to anchor him.”“Greg and Sherlock aren’t that close.”John gave her a funny look. “Aren’t they dating?”The look on Irene’s face was priceless. It was the first time he’d ever seen her so shocked. “Dating? Greg and Sherlock?” And then she started laughing.He just stared at her, even more confused. Irene cackled for a good two minutes and had to wipe tears of mirth away when she was done. “Oh my lord, could you imagine? Greg would kill him within a week. No, you idiot, Greg is a detective inspector working for the met and Sherlock is one of his consultants. He’s been working on a case lately where he requires Sherlock’s help. Besides, Greg is married.”“Oh,” John said quietly, trying to get his mind around this. No matter what Irene claimed, the two of them had to at least be friends. But she did have a point: he’d never seen them kiss or embrace, or do any of the other things he typically associated with couples. He bit his lip, knowing that he was blushing, and mumbled, “But… Molly and I were talking about being a third, and…”“She thought that you were married.”He didn’t remember giving Molly any ideas that might lead her to think that, but it wasn't like it mattered. He cleared his throat. “I didn’t know that about Sherlock and Lestrade. But it doesn’t change anything.”Irene’s eyes hardened. “Doesn’t it? I know you like Sherlock. “I’m not in –” His automatic protest got cut off by a lifted hand.“You might not be in love with him yet, but you’re more than halfway there,” Irene said sharply. “I know exactly what this is about because I’ve seen it happen a hundred times. Even if you and Sherlock were human, it wouldn’t matter that you’re both men. But the fact that you’re sentinel and guide makes it even more of a moot point. Don’t let something as stupid as what other people say stop you from being happy.”That was easy enough for Irene to say. John had never had a problem with people who were gay, but in relation to himself? “I’m not gay.”“There is such a thing as bisexuality,” she said, rolling her eyes. “If you don’t want Sherlock, that’s fine. I’m not going to force either of you into this. But if you do, and that’s the only thing holding you back from having everything with him, you’re a fucking idiot, John Watson. Because most guides and sentinels go their whole lives praying they’ll find a compatible mate that they want in every way, not just to bond. If you throw that away for something as ridiculous as this…”She let her voice trail off meaningfully and gave him one last pointed look. “Don’t bother coming in today. I’m closing the shop and rescheduling the clients. You need to go see Sherlock. Whatever you decide, you need to make it perfectly clear.”Irene was a formidable woman when she was upset, to the point that John found himself nodding meekly and exiting the shop without argument. He glanced over his shoulder as the door closed behind him. His heart was pounding again and he didn’t know what to do.",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

He continued to stare at the fountain not ten feet away. To anyone who walked by, he would’ve looked like he was mesmerized by the way the water arched into the air, giving off a light mist that was nice relief from the hot sun, before falling in a graceful stream to the ground. But in reality, his mind was so preoccupied that he wasn’t even paying attention. He could’ve been staring at an empty road or the side of a truck for all he cared.Harry gave an affronted sigh at the lack of reaction and plopped herself down. She was dressed like she’d been planning to head into work, which suggested that she’d already talked to Irene. But she was also clutching a cardboard tray bearing two coffees and a little white bakery bag that smelled delicious. John turned his head slowly, eyeing her until she pried one of the cups free and thrust it in his direction. The steam wafting up smelled of spice and cinnamon, and John took it.Apparently deciding that was as good as permission to talk, Harry picked right up on the very topic he did not want to discuss. “You’re not straight, are you? I mean, I did always wonder.”“You have not.”“Hate to break it to you, bro, but yeah, I have. I know you’ve always gone for the girls, but my gaydar has fabulous sense and it lights up around like a 60 watt bulb.” She paused, staring at him contemplatively as she tore the pastry bag open. “Well, okay, maybe more like a 40 watt bulb. Like I said, you always were more for the girls than the boys. Gotta give credit where it’s due.”In spite of himself, he snorted, unable to keep from cracking a slight smile. As annoying as Harry could be sometimes, her attitude was one of the things that he’d missed the most after she got so lost in her drinking. “I’m not gay, Harry. Or… whatever that other thing was. I don’t look at guys that way.”“Maybe not, but you look Sherlock that way,” Harry pointed out. “Bisexualism is a thing, John, and there’s nothing wrong with it. You don’t have to be all one way or all the other way. Some people swing right down the middle. Some people are mostly one way except for certain situations or people. Sexuality is fluid. You don’t get to draw a straight line and call it a day. That’s not how it works.”He sighed, dropping his head and staring at the ground. “I’ve never thought of myself that way,” he confessed quietly, displeased at the way his voice cracked a bit. “It’s never really… been an issue before.”“But it has happened.”John remained silent, but that didn’t stop his memory from persistently drumming up a couple moments from university. Against his better judgement, he had got drunk a few times, usually at the insistence of his roommates, and then gone out for a party. He could remember looking men appreciatively, even flirting once or twice so long as no one was around to see. But when the buzz wore off and he woke up sober the next day, he usually chalked it up to the alcohol and forced himself not to think any more about it. And then there was the army, where the word gay was pretty much unheard of. Sure times were beginning to change and would hopefully continue to do so, but right now it was still very much a straight man’s land. Guide and sentinel or not, if he and Bill had actually fallen in love it probably would’ve caused more than a few problems. Not from their superiors, because sentinels with the guides to back them up were rare and valuable, but from their comrades. Fortunately Bill was already married to a wonderful woman, and while he was interested in having a guide he had made it clear from the moment that he and John met that he loved his wife very much. She was the one who had kept him sane over the years, preventing him from slipping into a zone even though he was in his early forties, and he was determined that having a guide would not keep him from being faithful. John was fine with that. Really, he was. If anything, it made it easier for him and Bill to blend in. Men in the army formed close friendships all the time, and John could mourn the loss of a gorgeous woman’s company as well as the next man. God only knew how many hours he’d lost doing just that. Entertaining himself with one of the men surrounding him had never entered his mind, not even Bill – and if anyone should’ve tempted him, it would’ve been his sentinel. But was that because of the circumstances or because he was as straight as he claimed?It bothered him that he didn’t know.“John?” Harry pressed gently, after several minutes had gone by and he still hadn't formed an answer. “John, it’s okay, you know. Like I said, there’s nothing wrong with being gay. Or bisexual. Or whatever the hell you want to call yourself. God, for that matter you don’t have to call yourself anything at all. It's not necessary to put labels on everything. All that really matters is whether you want something with Sherlock.""""I don't know,"" John whispered. Realizing that Harry looked a little confused, he cleared his throat and repeated louder, ""I don't know. I never really let myself... and now that I kind of have, I can't tell if I like Sherlock or if it's the guide side of me that just wants to be close to a sentinel. Maybe any sentinel would do.""""You don't feel that way about Irene.""""Irene's different. She's bonded.""""Yeah, but you thought Sherlock was bonded too,"" Harry pointed out. She scooted a little bit closer and wrapped an arm around his shoulders, leaning against him. After a moment, John shifted and put his own arm around her waist to make it a little more comfortable. Harry was very warm against him. He couldn't remember the last time that they had been this close when she wasn't drunk off her arse.""I'm reluctant to rush into anything,"" he said finally. ""It's not like... with Sherlock and me, it would be permanent. I couldn't bond with him without mating too. It just wouldn't work. And that's forever.""""So what you're saying is, I wouldn't have to worry about another messy divorce.""He had to laugh a little at the wry, bittersweet comment. Harry and Clara had never been married, but they might as well have been. Their break-up had certainly been devastating enough to qualify as far as he was concerned. ""No, not in the slightest. We'd be a packaged deal for the rest of our lives. That's how it works; when the bond runs that deep, there's no coming back from it.""""You seem to be okay without Bill,"" she said cautiously.""Bill was... I didn't love him, Harry. He was my friend. We went to war together, and our bond was forged through battle. That's pretty much as major as it gets in that situation. But he already had a wife, and he didn't want anything else. So yes we were bonded and losing him nearly destroyed me, but it was..."" John trailed off, struggling to find words that could make her understand. It was impossible. At their very core, sentinels and guides were so different from humans and he didn't know how to explain. ""It's not what you would have with Sherlock,"" Harry filled in, and she just made it sound so simple. ""John, it sounds like you're just scared.""""I am not -""""Would you listen to me? Cripes, it's okay to be scared. There's nothing wrong with that, even if it does put a chink in your macho armour. Just like it's okay to be gay. You might be a guide but you're also still a human, you know. You have feelings just like the rest of us. And I know that when Clara and I first moved in together, I was terrified. I managed to hide it for the most part, but that doesn't mean I didn't feel it. And I'm still terrified now, when it comes to me and Irene.""""But you and Clara broke up, and even if things went bad between you and Irene... I won't have that option to walk away. If Sherlock and I did this and we ended up hating each other, it doesn't matter. We're still stuck together."" Even just saying it out loud was enough to make a fresh burst of panic lance through him.""Jesus, John, all that means is that you two actually have to work things out."" Harry shook her head. ""Obviously you don't have to do this. But the fact that you're sitting here agonizing over it tells me that you actually do want this. Otherwise you wouldn't have bothered.""John opened his mouth, intending to give her some sort of response, but instead he found that all of his words had unexpectedly dried up. Because Harry was right. He considered Sherlock a friend and had for some time now. There was just something about the man that John found it hard to dislike. Maybe it was because of the tattoo he got before he went to war, or maybe it was just because of the person that Sherlock was. Maybe it was a mixture of both. Bottom line was, he was sitting here wrestling with himself because this was something he really did want. He just didn't know if he could be okay with letting himself have it or dealing with the way people would look at him now.However, while being with Sherlock would drastically change the way he thought about himself whether he liked it or not, even if he decided against it and never saw Sherlock again he would still have this incident to deal with. His feelings for Sherlock, regardless of how he decided to label them, were not going to magically vanish. Even if he did find a female sentinel who was as good a fit for him as Sherlock was, that didn't erase the fact that he'd found himself attracted to and wanting to be with another man. Not unless he took all of that and stuffed it into a little box in the corner of his mind and decided that he was never going to think about it again. Though now that Harry knew, he doubted she would ever let him forget it even if he tried.He sighed and dropped his head into his hands, coming to the sudden realization that he'd known what he was going to do all along. He'd just needed someone to sit down beside him and prod him into it. And Harry had done that. He looked up at her as she stuffed a huge bite of chocolate biscuit into her mouth and asked, ""Are you happy with Irene, Harry?""Harry seemed surprised by the change of subject, but once she had swallowed she answered readily. ""Yeah, I am. I like her a lot. She reminds me of Clara in some ways, but not so much that I feel suffocated.""""What about Molly? Doesn't it bother you that the two of them are bonded?""""I dealt with my jealousy over that whole thing a long time ago, John,"" Harry said quietly, leaning backwards and letting her arm drop so that she could give him a not so gentle punch in the shoulder. ""I came to terms with just being a human when I was a kid. Meeting Molly and Irene doesn't change that. Besides, they were bonded long before I came into the picture. It would be stupid for me to have a problem with it when Irene's already told me there's room for me."" She narrowed her eyes. ""And quit trying to change the subject.""""I'm not,"" John said, rolling his eyes, though admittedly he was a little. He bounced his knee and fidgeted. ""I guess I need to figure out where Sherlock lives.""""Why?"" Harry demanded instantly. ""Because this isn't really a decision I can make on my own. It takes two to mate, you know.""Her smile was blinding. She grabbed his hand. ""I know where he lives. I'll text you the location. Go get him, bro.""""Thanks Harry,"" John said, pausing just long enough to kiss her on the cheek before he got up. He wasn't even bothered by the fact that she yelled after him.""Have lots of fun gay sex!""",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

He has no idea that meeting tattoo artist and sentinel Sherlock Holmes will change his life. Years later, that meeting gives him a safety net to cling to when everything goes to shit and he gets shipped home from war broken, traumatized and uncertain whether he'll ever be ready or capable of bonding again.","John took the tube to the address that Harry had given him, which turned out to be a wise decision. It gave him a few minutes of reprieve to just sit and fully come to terms with what he was about to do. The last thing that he wanted to do was bond with Sherlock and then wake up the next morning and freak out. That wouldn't be fair to either one of them. This was an enormous step and Sherlock deserved for him to be as fully committed beforehand as John could be.He left the tube and walked the rest of the short distance on foot, finding himself on the doorstep of a very nice London flat. There was no doubt that he was in the right place; the weather-worn 221B that was nailed to the front door made that clear. He leaned against the railing and stared thoughtfully at the door for a moment, trying to ignore how weak his knees felt now that he was actually here. He'd been a soldier for god's sake. There was no reason why he should be acting so cowardly.Except that whatever he chose to do next would change his life. John knew that better than possibly anyone, considering some of the life altering decisions that he had made in the past. There would be no going back once he crossed that threshold and Sherlock realized he was there; leaving without seeing him at that point would be as good as a rejection. He wasn't sure how long he had been standing there for, before the front door opened and an elderly woman stepped outside.""Oh,"" she said once she had turned around, looking a little surprised to see him. ""Can I help you?""John just stared at her, and after a moment she smiled.""Are you here to see Sherlock?"" she asked in a much gentler tone of voice, resting his hand on the rail as she moved carefully down the steps. ""I should tell you that he doesn't really do that sort of thing anymore, dear. But if you really need to speak with him, he is upstairs and you can go right in. Don't mind the hideous noise; he gets like that sometimes."" She gave him a pat on the arm. ""And I'll be out for a while, so, whatever you two want to discuss, you can have some privacy.""""What?"" John said, bewildered and wondering just what it was she thought he was there to do. ""It's alright. Go ahead,"" she repeated with another pat.His legs moved of their own accord then, carrying him up the steps and into the flat. John closed the door behind him automatically, realizing instantly what she'd meant with her remark about the noise. Sherlock was playing his violin, but there was none of the beautiful, sweet music that John had grown accustomed to at the shop. Instead, it sounded like Sherlock was up there murdering some poor cat very slowly. The high-pitched shrieking was enough to make the hair on his arms stand up straight.Uneasy, he walked slowly to the steps and started to mount them. But by the time he got to the top, he was running. He couldn't help remembering everything that Irene had implied about Sherlock's state of mind. What if this was a result of the fact that they hadn't bonded yet, and Sherlock's senses were starting to go on him?  He'd seen it happen before during uni. A sentinel who'd been unbonded too long had been brought to the hospital, and it was like all of her senses had been going haywire.The thought of seeing Sherlock like that was chilling.""Sherlock!"" John threw the door open without bothering to knock, half afraid of what he might find.Sherlock turned around, his violin tucked underneath his chin, and raised an eyebrow. He was fully dressed in the sort of clothing he wore to the shop: tight jeans, a blue shirt that was only partially buttoned, though his feet were bare. His hair was as messy as ever, but he was clean-shaven and didn't look like someone who was producing the kind of sounds that John had just been listening to.""I wondered how long you were going to stand out there,"" he said, drawing the bowing across the strings with one last, jaw clenching squeal.""You..."" John took a deep breath to ease the pounding of his heart, because he'd never forgotten that Sherlock could hear that easily, and looked around. For someone who was supposedly at risk of falling into a zone, Sherlock didn't seem to be in pain. Or confused. Or in need of any help at all, really. He was beginning to have the strong suspicion that he might have fallen right into Irene's trap.""Come in and close the door, then,"" Sherlock snapped, gently lifting his violin away from his chest. He knelt to place it back inside of its box, his fingers caressing the wood tenderly as he closed the lid. John obeyed just like he always did, though at least this time Sherlock didn't order him to strip down. ""Irene told me -""""Of course she did,"" Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes. ""And you believed her every word, did you? Ever since the day we met, she's been trying to get me bonded. She lives under the misguided illusion that every sentinel in the world must want a bonded guide.""""Don't they?""""Why on earth would you want to be tied down like that?"" Sherlock demanded, spinning to face him. ""Having to live your life at the whim of another person, it's like having another brother or Irene."" He paused for a moment as though to contemplate the concept and then shuddered. ""They're more than enough. I have no need for anyone else.""""You have a brother?"" John asked, momentarily stuck on that bit on information.""Yes."" His tone of voice made it abundantly clear that there was no love lost between the siblings.""Funny, I have a sister. So I know exactly how you feel."" He forced a laugh that he didn't really feel and crossed the distance between them. Sherlock tensed as he came closer, but John stood his ground. ""And if your relationship with Irene or your brother is anything similar, then I get how much of a pain they've probably been ever since we met. God knows that Harry spent about an hour this morning trying to talk me into coming here.""Sherlock scowled and started to say something, undoubtedly about how there was really no need for John to have made the journey if he didn't want to be there, but John didn't give him the chance. It turned out that all he really needed to settle the last of his nerves was to see Sherlock again, to have two minutes alone with this frustrating, aggravating, irreplaceable man and realize that this really was what he wanted.That dark, curly hair was as soft as John had imagined. He couldn't help curling his fingers into the strands as he pulled Sherlock's head down to meet him. The initial brush of their lips was very chaste, mostly because Sherlock inhaled in surprise and tilted his head wrong, so that John ended up half-kissing his chin. He chuckled and Sherlock snorted.The second kiss was better, after John gently tipped the head in his hands to a better angle and gave it another shot. Their mouths fit together perfectly, and he discovered quickly that it wasn't so different kissing a man as it was a woman. The feel of the skin beneath his fingertips was still warm and the lips against his were moving softly, searching, and he could feel arousal humming through him the longer they kissed.""I want this,"" John breathed against Sherlock's mouth, making sure that he was looking into Sherlock's eyes. Wanting Sherlock to figure out that he was telling the honest to god truth here. ""I'm sorry it took me so long to figure it out, but I do. If you think you can take the risk of being tied down, that is.""He shivered when Sherlock's fingers ghosted down his sides. It should've been impossible to feel that light touch through his coat and shirt, but he was certain he would have felt that heat no matter how many layers that he had on. Sherlock was staring at him with a thin line between his eyebrows, and then, like he was curious to see John's reaction, he boldly slipped his hand beneath John's shirt.""Have you seen it?"" he inquired.""Seen what?""""The tattoo.""""Oh. No."" John knew he was blushing. Suddenly it seemed like a very childish way of handling things, to not even look in the mirror when he cleaned his tattoo.Sherlock's smirk was feral. ""Good.""This time the kiss felt a little like John was being devoured. Sherlock reeled him in, and evidently everything he'd said about not wanting to be bonded was just a farce to save face. Or possibly he had meant it right up until John kissed him. Or maybe it was a little bit of both.But whatever the reason, it was obvious Sherlock was quickly getting over his hesitations about bonding.""What is it?"" John gasped out when he could speak again. It turned out Sherlock could hold his breath a lot longer than he could, and the depth and length of their kissing was leaving him light-headed.""Something that had the possibility to make you angry,"" Sherlock admitted, his hands working quickly to divest John of his clothing. ""I deduced long ago that you were attracted to me, but I wasn't certain that you would want... this.""He still didn't sound very certain, John realized. At some point his hands had fallen away from Sherlock's hair. Now, he cupped Sherlock's cheek. ""Hey. Hey. I meant what I said. Irene and Harry didn't coerce me into coming here, if that's what you're thinking. I might have needed a pep talk, but this is all me. And before you even bother to ask, I'm not just here because you're an unbonded sentinel and I'm a guide who happens to be in need of one.""I'm here because... fuck, Sherlock, you're amazing. I've always felt that way about you, right from the moment that I first saw your work. The things you can do, it's astounding. But it's not just that. You're clever and arrogant and so goddamn intelligent. I like how careful you are when you work and how honest you are. I like knowing that I managed to work my way in through your shields without even trying."" His mouth quirked into a faint smile at Sherlock's pout.""You did not,"" Sherlock muttered petulantly.""Actually, I rather think I did,"" John said, pushing him backwards until Sherlock had no choice but to sit down on the sofa. John straddled him then, liking the strength in Sherlock's graceful hands when he reached up to steady him. ""I told you, I deduced -""Laughing, John pulled him into another deep kiss. Whatever Sherlock had or hadn't deduced was not up for debate. He ground down against Sherlock deliberately, relishing in the way that Sherlock gasped. He had a few suspicions about how much Sherlock knew about sex, not that it really mattered. When it came to bonding, to mating, it wouldn't be long before their most base, raw instincts took over.He could see it happening in the dilation of Sherlock's pupils, the expression of lust and possessiveness painting across the man's face as his grip tightened on John's waist. John took the opportunity to rock their hips together again, moaning at the spark of pleasure. It had been a very long time since he'd done this, not since he'd broken up with Mary, and he wanted Sherlock to do something. Anything.It was entirely possible he might have said that part out loud, because Sherlock growled deep in his chest, a low, rumbling sound that made John's blood burn, and stood up with no warning. John squeaked as he suddenly found himself in the air, his legs now wrapped around Sherlock's waist and strong arms gripping his waist to keep him from falling. Sherlock carried him into the bedroom, where they literally fell onto the bed together.Clothing was ripped in their frenzy. John knew that much. He fulfilled a long hidden fantasy by grabbing Sherlock's shirt at the collar and wrenching it open, sending the straining buttons flying in all directions. That only seemed to excite Sherlock further, his eyes nearly black now as he stripped John naked himself this time.The room was growing hazy around them and John could feel himself opening like he never had before. His shields weren't shattering or falling the way that he had feared they might; it was more like Sherlock was surging into him, finding every empty place that John hadn't even known existed. Those places made him ache, made him arch his back in frantic pleading.And in return, he could feel the sense of unbalance in Sherlock. The way his senses were raging, overwhelming him, and he wanted to soothe that. He wanted to bring that control back to the man who needed it so desperately.""Sherlock,"" he rasped, reaching up to again tangle his fingers in Sherlock's hair. ""Sherlock, I'm ready.""",On My Heart (just like a tattoo),29062

Any feedback you have to offer would be much appreciated!",2014-09-26, Teen And Up Audiences, Sherlock Holmes/John Watson,What if John Watson was not the man he said he was? What if he was the criminal mastermind pulling at each and every one of Sherlock Holmes' delicate strings?<br />(Exchangelock AU Prompt: What if (at the pool scene in “the great game”) John was actually Moriarty?),"A“Brought you a little ‘get to know you’ present,” Sherlock called into the empty pool, waving the flash drive in the air triumphantly, “That’s what it’s all been for, isn’t it?”AThe consulting detective looked around, hoping to catch a glimpse of the man who had been his most challenging opponent yet, before continuing. “All your puzzles, making me dance; all to distract me from this.”AFrustrated that the criminal had not taken the bait and shown his face, Sherlock turned to face the door, briefly wondering if he had been set up. It was an optimal murder conditions, after all. He vaguely wondered if his tendency towards dramatic entrances was to blame for his many near-death experiences, but shrugged the idea off quickly. Dramatic entrances made him look cool.AThere was a creak from behind him, causing the consulting detective to whip around, anxious to see the face behind the series of riddles he had solved over the past few weeks.ATo his immense surprise, John Watson was leaning against one of the shower stalls, a small smirk playing on his lips, his eyes alight with amusement. Where Sherlock’s deductions usually appeared were the words “liar” and “Moriarty”.A“John?” Sherlock winced at how small his voice was.AJohn’s smirk widened as he stood up straight and ambled towards Sherlock lazily.A“Now, come on, Sherlock,” The blond drawled in a smoother tone than Sherlock knew him capable of, “There’s no need to look so down in the dumps. Did you honestly prefer the John Watson that you knew? The blissfully ignorant creature who believed you were a god? You couldn’t have.”ASherlock clenched his fists, his mind racing with information. Mycroft would be very cross at him for getting involved yet again; the worst of it was, the fat old man would be entirely correct to do so. He had been taken in by John’s lies; he had believed him entirely. If and when he returned to his flat, his John would not be there. His John would never be there again. In his place would be this man with the terrible smirk. He thought back to the number of times that he had mocked John’s intelligence, all while falling for the criminal’s own devious plan. How ironic.A“So, you’re Moriarty?” The consulting detective challenged, maintaining his cool exterior with some difficulty.AJohn laughed. “I made up Moriarty, Sherlock. I couldn’t walk around the streets of London if my clients knew who I was. You’ve met a few of them; I’m sure you understand.”A“Why did you go through all of this trouble? We shared a flat. You had access to me almost every second of every day. There was no need to part with thirty million quid just to get me alone in a secluded environment.” Sherlock reasoned, struggling to recover the upper hand that he was realizing had never truly been his.AJohn shrugged, taking another step towards Sherlock. The consulting detective’s hand twitched towards the revolver in his pocket. He briefly wondered if he would be capable of killing John Watson.A“I’ve said it before, haven’t I? I like watching you dance. Oh, no, there’s no need for the gun. I have no intention of hurting you. If I wanted you gone, you would’ve been ten feet underground months ago. You’re much more interesting when you’re alive.” The shorter man replied cheerfully.ASherlock’s eyes narrowed. “So what, then? You take the Partington plans and flee the country? Find a way to frame me for treason? What is the next plan of action, John?” He demanded.A“I hardly think that I would need to frame you. You are committing treason by offering me those plans, you know. Mycroft would not be pleased with you. Anyway, you might as well return them to your brother. I couldn’t care less about the bloody plans.” John responded with a smile.A“Pray tell, what is the plan of action?” Sherlock inquired, his fingers brushing against the revolver in his pocket in an attempt to soothe himself.AJohn’s eyes lit up at the question. “You have to die.” He answered pleasantly.ASherlock arched an eyebrow. He was not afraid, he realized. Dying at the hands of an incredibly interesting John Watson was not the worst way to go by any means. He would not have to worry about leaving behind a grieving flatmate, at the very least.A“I thought you had no intention of hurting me?” The consulting detective reminded his opponent.A“I don’t,” John agreed, “but if I don’t, someone else will. You have no idea, you truly don’t. There are so many people just like me who have had their eye on you for years. They’d love to have you, Sherlock. They’d love to possess that cold, calculating mind. They’d love to say that they've bested the best. I’ve kept them at bay for as long as I could, but now it’s time for you to die. Or, at least, convince the rest of the world that you’re dead. If it’s in the newspapers, it must be true.”A“You want me to fake my own death.” Sherlock clarified.A“Very good.” John praised with a small smirk.A“Why? Why not just kill me? Say that you defeated the great Sherlock Holmes? I’m sure you would receive even more clients. Where’s your advantage in keeping me alive?” Sherlock demanded, irritated that John was not following the most rational path of logic.AJohn cocked his head, looking mildly surprised. “Would you like me to kill you, Sherlock? Would you like to die at the hands of a man you believed that you could trust?”A“I don’t relish the thought, nor do I shy away from it. It is the most rational decision. Everything grows complicated if I survive.” Sherlock growled, taking a step towards John, intentionally towering over his former flatmate.ATo his surprise, John just laughed, looking completely at ease even under the circumstances.A“As far as I’m concerned, anything grows complicated the moment it involves you. Whether or not you want to die isn’t particularly important. In case you haven’t noticed, I have put a great deal of effort into keeping you alive, mostly for my own sake.”ASherlock looked as unimpressed as he could. “You still haven’t told me why you’ve kept me alive. I’m very curious to hear your reasoning.”A“I’ll tell you what, Sherlock. I’ll give you my entire story. Once I finish, you can decide whether or not you want to fake your death. Just know that if you decide against it, I will consider it an act of kindness to kill you before my competitors get to you, and I really, really don’t want to do that.” John responded, sparing his flatmate a painfully familiar smile before leaning against the wall and waiting for Sherlock to respond.A“How do I know that you aren’t making up yet another story? You seem to be rather good at it.” Sherlock remarked cynically.A“You’ll just have to trust me.” John answered with a small shrug.ASherlock snorted at the irony. John smirked.A“Let’s hear it, then.” The consulting detective drawled, folding his arms across his chest expectantly.A“My parents died when Harry and I were kids - yes, Harry is real - leaving us to take care of ourselves. While I tried to balance school, work, and rugby, Harry drank all of our money away. We never had enough; if I didn’t find another way to make money, we would starve. So I enlisted a few of my rugby friends with lesser morals and created a small web. It was nothing serious - nobody got hurt - we would just slip a few things out of lockers, take a few wallets here and there; the bare necessities for survival,” John began, his eyes searching Sherlock’s face, as though he was trying to justify his actions.A“Petty theft is usually a starting point for criminals, although I did expect a bit more from someone of your caliber. Continue,” Sherlock muttered in the most patronizing tone he could manage, watching John through narrow eyes.ATo Sherlock’s surprise, John just chuckled.A“I’m sorry that I’ve disappointed you with my meager beginning. Anyway,” The shorter man continued, “I set up a bit of a web, but tried to straighten my act when I joined the army. Getting caught nicking somebody’s wallet would get me kicked out and jailed. I couldn’t risk that when Harry was still depending on me. After going straight for a little while, some of my mates started telling me about the crimes they’d seen, the different ways that people had tried to get away with murder. That’s when I heard about you.”A“Hm.” Sherlock murmured, forcing himself to look unimpressed.A“Suddenly I had something to do besides tend to the weak and outsmart the stupid. I had competition. I wanted to see if you were as good as they said you were, so I threw a few curveballs in your direction to see if you would be worth my time. Mrs. Hudson’s husband, the murder that Angelo had been accused of...little things, you know, but just enough to confuse poor Greg Lestrade.”A“Anything is enough to confuse Greg Lestrade.” Sherlock snorted.AJohn shrugged in agreement. “Once you proved to be slightly above average intelligence, I did my research. You were looking for a flat in the area, and you were working out of St. Bart’s until you found a place of residence. I tracked down Mike Stamford, managed to make it look like an accident, and the rest was just history.”A“The psychosomatic limp?” Sherlock inquired.A“Just enough to keep you interested.” John answered smugly.ASherlock nodded, disgusted that he had been so easily manipulated. “Clever.”A“Living with you only made things simpler. Stringing together a criminal web while living with their greatest adversary was a piece of cake. I already had Jefferson Hope operating; he was the first domino in a line.”  John agreed with a smirk.ASherlock took a few steps to the side, his eyebrows furrowing slightly. “You shot him to dispose of the evidence - of course.”AJohn nodded, his smug grin fading only slightly. “I couldn’t let one stupid cabbie ruin my plan. I did have plans for you, you know. Oh, there were a few ways I could’ve gone about it. I could have poisoned your food and watched the look on your face as you realized a bit too late that your best friend was also your killer. I could have smothered you in your sleep and felt the life leave your body. I could have decapitated you while you were stumbling around that insipid mind palace of yours and left your corpse on Mycroft’s doorstep. There were so many things I could have done to you, Sherlock, but none of them seemed quite so appealing after that first night in Baker Street.”A“So that’s why you’re keeping me alive, then? Can’t think of a satisfying way to kill me?” Sherlock inquired, not so much out of anger, but instead out of interest.AJohn laughed. “I wish it were that simple. I didn’t plan to like you quite as much as I did.”ASherlock was rendered speechless. He arched a cynical eyebrow, waiting for John to further explain himself.A“You’re a mad bastard, Sherlock Holmes,” The shorter man commented, following and mimicking Sherlock’s movements like a jungle cat waiting to pounce, “And I don’t think that I have any interest in a life in which you do not exist.”A“Are you…?” Sherlock trailed off hopefully, unsure of how to describe John’s behavior.AJohn rolled his eyes. “Don’t be dull, Sherlock. You know I’m not very good at this sort of thing. You have your options. Now you have to make a choice.”A“Describe to me exactly what would happen if I were to fake my death.” Sherlock challenged.A“You’re stalling,” John disproved in an exasperated tone, “but this might be the last time I see you alive, so I’ll let it go. If you fake your death, you and I will go to a country - the name of which I’m not at liberty to tell you in the open like this - where I will resume my existence as John Watson. Jim Moriarty’s name will appear in the obituary column of the newspaper tomorrow morning, alongside of your name. If you choose to continue solving your little crimes, you will have to select smaller cases, which you can’t take credit for solving.”A“And what will occur between us?” Sherlock demanded.AJohn shrugged. “Whatever you want, Sherlock. I’m not going to force myself upon you. I’ll let you live whether or not you reciprocate any romantic feelings, provided that you still fake your death.”A“And what if,” Sherlock began, pausing to muddle through the string of words floating through his mind, “what if the feeling was reciprocated? For John Watson, of course. I’m not particularly fond of James Moriarty.”AJohn grinned. “I’ll phone the newspaper. They’ll want to hear about our tragic deaths.”A“And I’ll pack the bags.” Sherlock smirked.AAs John strode past Sherlock, the taller man grabbed his arm, momentarily stopping him.A“If you lie to me again, I’ll take the other option. Lestrade may be a bumbling idiot, but Mycroft might be able to make just enough sense of the situation to figure it out a year or two after my death.” The consulting detective growled.AJohn laughed, completely at ease despite Sherlock’s threat. “Whatever you say.”A“And I get to solve your crimes.” Sherlock ventured, feeling a bit bolder.A“No shit, Sherlock.” John chuckled, sauntering in the direction of the door, “It wouldn’t be half as fun without you.”A“Sherlock?”ASherlock looked around in confusion. He could hear John’s voice echoing throughout the pool, but could no longer see the man.A“Sherlock.” John’s voice repeated with an edge of exasperation.ASuddenly something - a pillow, Sherlock’s mind wildly supplied - hit the world’s only consulting detective in the face, snapping him back into consciousness.A“John?” He slurred, propping himself up against the headboard of his bed and looking at his flatmate stupidly. “How long have I been asleep?”AJohn glanced around the room before shrugging noncommittally. “Few hours, maybe a day or two.”ASherlock rubbed his eyes and looked down at his clock. He knew that he slept like the dead once he had reached the end of a particularly challenging case, but this might have been a new record.A“It was all a dream, then.” He murmured, overwhelmed by a combination of relief and disappointment.AJohn was still John. That was good. However, John was still some other woman’s John. That was not so good.A“Have a nightmare?” The shorter man prompted as he approached the door to Sherlock’s room.ASherlock snorted. “Nightmares are for children, John.”AJohn rolled his eyes, but smiled good-naturedly. Sherlock had missed John’s warm demeanor. The almost reptilian coldness of John Watson the consulting criminal had been by far the worst part about his dream. Sherlock managed to suppress a contented sigh at the very sight of his smiling best friend.A“Want to talk about it? That sort of thing helps sometimes,” John offered with a sheepish smile, “I know when I, uh, well, erm,” he let out a meaningful cough, “It helped me out a bit.”ASherlock shook his head slowly.A“Alright then,” John said in a surprisingly chipper voice, “feel like going out for Chinese? There’s nothing in and I’m starving.”A“I suppose I could eat.” Sherlock agreed at length.AJohn smiled and grasped the doorknob, clearly about to exit the room.A“John?”AThe shorter man turned around, eyebrow quirked and head cocked. “Yeah?”A“What is the cleanest method of decapitation?”AJohn let out a huffy laugh. “I haven’t the slightest idea.”ASherlock nodded, satisfied with John’s answer. Had it been John Watson the consulting criminal, Sherlock would have undoubtedly received an immediate answer followed by numerous accounts of decapitations that John had witnessed and/or completed.A“Were you expecting an answer or do you want to talk about decapitations?” John questioned with a smile.ASherlock shook his head. “I was just picking your brain. Useless, as always.”A“Good to be appreciated.” John rolled his eyes and exited the room, leaving Sherlock to his own relieved thoughts.AShutting the consulting detective’s door, John quickly crossed the flat and pulled out his phone. His brows were furrowed and his smile had disappeared the moment he had exited Sherlock’s room. He glowered at Sherlock’s empty chair as he listened to a particularly annoying dial tone.A“Sebastian,” John murmured the moment his assistant answered the phone, “we’ve got a code delta on our hands.”AThere was a long pause. John’s eyes did not stray from the chair as he listened to any excuses that Sebastian Moran had to offer. He was not particularly interested in excuses.A“Yes, it is imperative. It is my plan - I know when to enact it. His mind’s put it together much faster than I thought it would. He is a rather clever boy. I’ve thrown him off the trail for a bit - just a band-aid, really, he’ll figure it out before the week’s up - but that’s enough time for us to plan out his imminent demise. What do you think about a suicide leap off of St. Bart’s? It’s certainly a death dramatic enough for any of the Holmes boys.”AThere was another pause. John could hear Sherlock opening and closing his closet numerous times. The consulting detective really did have an eye for fashion. John’s mouth crooked into a small smile as Sebastian continued to drone on.A“This is not a request,” John interrupted his assistant irritably, “this is your mission. Get Sherlock on the roof of St. Bart’s by the end of the week. If he’s so much as a minute late, your entire family will receive an incredibly unpleasant visit from a few business acquaintances of mine. Do you understand me?”AHe hung up the phone before he could receive a response. He knew that Sebastian would follow through. He always did, especially when the stakes were this high.AAs he tossed his phone onto the couch dispassionately, Sherlock exited his room, still looking thoroughly disoriented.A“Who was on the phone?” Sherlock asked, eying John’s phone cautiously.AJohn shrugged and rolled his eyes. “Harry, of course. Drunk as ever and asking me to patch things up with Clara.”ASherlock nodded, apparently accepting this answer.A“Ready to go?” John asked, hoping to distract his flatmate.A“Mm.” Sherlock answered with a slight nod.A“Right then, grab your coat and let’s get going,” John instructed, approaching the door. AAs Sherlock skulked down the hall towards the coat rack, John smirked.A""The game is on."" He muttered under his breath.AA AA ",,3132

And Beautiful. And Fragile. He sees himself in the mirror every morning, and he knows that he deserves the names. But they are not meant in a hurtful way; Sherlock sees himself more clearly than anyone. Like the shards of a shattered mirror, John says.","A-=-=-=-=-AAOneAAA-=-=-=-=-AAThe Siberian winters do not constitute casual visitations. Not only is the inclement weather enough to scare any tourist off, but it’s also filled with widespread turmoil and underground threats.ASherlock is not bothered at all by the one, but he is infinitely concerned about the other.AThe next logical step, therefore, is take up lodgings somewhere where he doesn’t have to pay a long term rent. He’s uninterested in a flatmate, and it isn’t long where he finds a little old man with a cocaine addiction and no job. A small amount every week or so keeps him there with hot water and a stocked kitchen to boot. The Siberian way of life is a simple one, he’ll give them that.AHe’s been in the country for one month when the summons come for him to kill. No one individual, not even Mycroft, could tell him the names of everyone that poses a threat to his home in London, but going one target at a time will accomplish more than waiting. His first target is a low-level politician by the name of Boris Vsevold with an affiliation in Moriarty’s crime circles. Fifty-six years old, overweight, and with a life expectancy of four more years, five at best. It doesn’t take long for him to find a drugstore that sells ethylene glycol and pay him a visit.AThe man dies in his sleep three days later.AThey don’t even give him an autopsy.A-=-=-=-=-AHe moves on to another flat eighteen miles away. It’s a small affair, not nearly as inviting as 221B, but habitable nonetheless. He finds the landlady’s missing cat and she gives him a week’s lodgings for free. It’s all he needs.AAt night he smokes cigarettes and stares up at the frigid sky and shivers even though he isn’t cold, and wonders what John would say. What John would think, if he could see him now. He blows out a puff of smoke and tries to imagine his face, watching him like he so often used to.A-=-=-=-=-A“You’ve received an invitation to a dinner party being hosted by your next target,” Mycroft informs him, placid voice sounding disinterested.A“And how on earth did I garner that?” Sherlock inquires, his sarcasm almost painful.AMycroft laughs drily. “You’ll find your suit waiting for you at your flat.”AThey hang up without so much as a goodbye.ASherlock researches him that night before getting dressed. A picture tells him most of what he needs to know, and the file completes it. (Closeted gay no current lover very fond of fine wine status: Important Informant.)AIn the left pocket, the tiniest of plastic bags with scopolamine. It makes Sherlock smile.A-=-=-=-AThe suit is well-fitted, and it hugs his frame in all the right places. Sherlock adjusts his bowtie and puts on a smile to the mirror. It looks fragile and insincere, but only he will know that.AMycroft sends a car for him and he gets on his way, the lights ahead of houses full of mirth like mockery in his ears.AThe party is a substantial affair, hundreds of glittering people in the finest clothes and wine to make Mycroft envious. Sherlock picks the man out, sitting at the bar sipping at a glass of alcohol and approaches him casually.AIt’s far too easy to flirt him into relaxation, and even easier to slip the drug into his pinot grigio. When he suggests they get themselves a room, he complies immediately.ALater, as he pulls the man into bed and lets him take him as he wants, (which means riding the older man until he's howling in Russian,) he tries not to feel sick at how very wrong it is. How very unlike John the man below him is, how he could never, ever be John and never ever will be. What would John think, if he could see him now?AWhispered answers and promises of further information; the man's drug-addled mind gives him what he needs and lets him deduce the rest.AThe man is found dead in his bed the next morning by his nephew Viktor, suffering from respiratory collapse. It had been expected for some time; the man was carrying far too many extra pounds and his heart had never been strong.AWhat a shame.A-=-=-=-AJoining a Siberian terrorist network is less tricky than it might sound. The true difficulty is in keeping up the facade. Sherlock does not enjoy speaking Russian; but he breathes out every syllable with John in the back of his mind and it comes easier. He's been in Siberia for six months, two of which he's spent solely getting the leaders of the squad to trust him. He would never forget how many people he had to kill for the sake of loyalty, how many guilty souls were borne on his back.ABut once he has the swing of it, killing gets easier and easier. He feels no remorse shooting Arkada, (Russian woman wife of squad leader terrorist level: Intimate). The shouts that follow and the footsteps behind him are music to his ears.AOver, and over, he picks off each person on his list. One by one. Life for life, death for death.AAnd it is all for the same cause. He fight under the same banner. All of it, everything, he does for John.A-=-=-=-=-AHe has garnered a name for himself. They call him Vostochnyy Veter. The East Wind. If the East Wind is coming for you, you don't talk about it. Usually because you don't find out about it yourself; someone else always seems to know. A friend, a brother, an enemy. Whispered words in a dark hallway or a scrap of paper with hastily written words. Whatever the message's form, it always said the same thing.A AAThe East Wind is coming for you.AA ASherlock likes the name. It fits. He seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the earth in worship of a higher name. But it is no deity his mind drifts to when he drops off for a few hours' sleep at night, or when the shlyukha, the whores ask him to share their bed. He doesn't even have to pay, they promise. It makes his stomach turn; makes invisible sickness fester in his heart. They are nothing. They are less than nothing, could never even begin to compare to the perfection that John is. John is everything, and his name burns like a brand on Sherlock's brain, like a tattoo he could never erase, not put there by physical hands. He had the idea once of having John's name inked onto his left wrist; a token he could always look to when he had doubts or fears about killing. But the whole reason of him being here was so that no one could touch John, no one could soil his name with their filthy mouths or ever even foster the idea of hurting him.ASherlock would have bombed Siberia first. The country going up in flames, eating away flesh and cloth and stone. A primal offering of the most ironic kind, given all to John. A city brought to its knees so it could bow in homage to him.AIt was such a beautiful idea.A-=-=-=-AATwoAAA-=-=-=-AATwo years, three months and forty-two days. Two years, three months and forty-two days of hiding, of sneaking, of killing, of saving. Of waiting.AAnd now it's all to end as he runs for his life in a forest wet with freezing rain.AHis hair is in ruins; the tie he used to keep it back broken, his skin slathered with mud. His clothes are tatters in the inclement weather. If only John were there to warm him up. But the East Wind knows no warmth; it is cold and dark and has no concept or remorse or fear. If he is to die, then he'll die. John is safe. John will always be safe.AThey torture him, but he'd known that they would. Beat him until his skin was crusted with blood, pulled his hair until it ripped from its roots. He knows his left third rib is broken. One wrist is sprained. Gradually, everything fades into a haze of pain and he can ignore the thudding of his temples; the throbbing of his ribs where he pulls in every treacherous breath.AThe man with the whip bends forward, ready for the last hits. Sherlock is powerless, and he knows it. He cannot fight the man, and the man knows it. One last deduction. One last parting word to ease himself out of the world. Let it never be said The East Wind died silent.AIt works.AIt works.AThe man runs-runs to his wife and the man she's taken over him to love. Human Error has, once again, saved his life.AThe man sitting in the corner stands up. Approaches him and pulls him up by the hair.ASherlock recognizes his voice.AAIt’s time to go home.AA-=-=-=-=-AIn the hotel room outside of London, where he spends the night before finding John, because of course he would have found him, he will always find him. He could never not find him. Sherlock touches himself, envisioning John's beautiful face above him. He ruts against his own fingers, eyes squeezed closed as he imagines John pressing into him, taking him slow and tender then hard and fast and everything in between. He holds his pillow close, this anchor of softness that will hold him off for the few hours left before he can enfold John in his arms and hold him tightly enough to never let go. He needs to touch him; it’s a physical burn in his limbs to get up and find him. But he has to wait. He must wait; he can wait.AHe promised that he would wait.A-=-=-=-AJohn is engaged to a serial killer.AHer name is Mary. She is thirty-four years with short blonde hair and a wicked smile. Her eyes are bright with intelligence and the need to find amusement.AShe is so marvelously subtle, so teasingly hinting, just barely offering her reasons for being there.ABut John loves her. And she makes him happy.AWhen he cannot find John in the flat he immediately seeks her out, his face anamaline in its fury.A“Where is he?” He shouts, gripping her wrists so tightly they turn white.AMary smiles at him. “If you get going now, I’ll text you clues.”ASherlock intercepts a motorcyclist and waits, shaking with anger and fear.AHis phone beeps not five minutes later.AASave Souls now! John or James Watson? AAAnd then followed by, Saint or Sinner? James or John? The more is Less? ASkip code. He can do a skip code.AHis mind races to connect the dots. St. James the Less, approximately ten minutes going ETA. He takes off, speed limit and traffic laws ignored. They aren’t important right now, nothing is important right now except for the dying man that needs him.AHe’s thirty seconds later. Getting warmer, Mr. Holmes. You have about ten minutes. ATwo minutes pass. 8 minutes and counting…AAs if he needs to be told.AHe runs into a traffic hold-up; going across the sidewalk and through a side street will take five minutes. He does the only thing he can.AThree flights of stone steps and five minutes later he receives a fourth text.AABetter hurry; things are heating up here. AAThere are tears running down his cheeks from his eyes being so wide from constantly looking, and his hands are shaking on the handle bars. But he can do this. He must do this.AAnd, at least, a small reward for his efforts. For some reason, whatever’s happening to John has been slowed down. Stay of execution. You’ve got two more minutes. ASomehow it doesn’t comfort him.AHe takes a straight path instead of the more legal winding one and cuts down two minutes.AAs his eyes fasten on a group of people laughing and talking around a bonfire, he gets one last text.AAWhat a shame, Mr. Holmes. John is quite a Guy! AAAnd the pieces lock together.AHe doesn’t just jump off his motorcycle; he throws himself off, scrambling madly towards the licking flames, eating up the wood that covers his most precious thing.A“Move!” He barely hears himself yelling, but the crowd parts anyway. “Move move move John-“AHe digs through the wood, coughing back smoke and ash and the pungent smell of lighter fluid. John, his mind is screaming, and he can feel his mouth screaming it too.AAPlease John please please pleaseAAA AAJohn is underneath the wood. Blood oozes from a cut on his temple and his face is pale, but he is alive. He is alive as Sherlock lays him on the ground and cups his face, brushing strands of hair from his forehead.AJohn, he whispers.AThe man in his arms just coughs out smoke.A-=-=-=-=-AJohn marries her.AHe marries her, because Sherlock cannot tell him that Mary tried to kill him, and to Mary it is all a game. An amusing pastime to be dropped when the fancy strikes her.ASherlock was hunted for years by people who wanted him dead, and yet he has never been so afraid as he is now.AThe game is never over.A-=-=-=-=-AMonths pass, and Sherlock can tell that Mary is getting bored. Domestic life does not suit her, nothing suits her. She is petulant and snappish, and John tells him it’s because she’s just been settling in.ASherlock pulls her aside and tells her to try to kill him if she gets too bored. She licks her lipsticked lips and nods, glee sparking in her eyes.A-=-=-=-AAnd she does try to kill him. But with a slightly different method than he’d been anticipating; being shot in cold blood in the flat. She's grown tired of the game, she whispers to him. Time to move on, then. She stands above him, watching in delighted fascination as his life bleeds into the 221B carpet.AThe world fades into a haze of grey as he sees her finally stepping away, towards the door and to freedom. He sees her on her phone just before he blacks out; fingers typing out a message.A AJohn finds him.A AHe wakes up in a hospital-things are sterile, and cold, and white. John tells him he's been out for three days. There are dark shadows under his eyes. Sherlock wants to kiss them away, to make him happy again.AJohn tells him that Mary was pregnant.A Sherlock imagines pressing a gun to her belly and pulling the trigger.A-=-=-=-=-A AEven after he recovers, John doesn't let him touch him for a month. He barely speaks; this time it is Sherlock who's forcing him to stay alive. Telling him that he can do this, that he loves him, that he'll be there to help him.AOne evening Sherlock comes upstairs with takeaway picked out especially for him, and the smell of alcohol is on his breath and anger is in his eyes.A""You. If you'd never come back, she wouldn't care. She wouldn't have found you interesting. Just like Everyone. finds you. So fucking interesting.""A""John, we can talk about this if you want...it's going to be okay...it's-"" his voice is broken off in a cry of pain as John's fist connects with his chin.A""IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S A FUCKING WRECK, SHERLOCK, IT'S A BLOODY FUCKING WRECK."" John is screaming at him, and there's blood running down his chin and then he's crying, crumpling to his knees and sobbing like a child. And Sherlock cannot bear it; the East Wind always gives way to that of the Warm South. He crawls forward, spitting out his own blood and pulling the sobbing man into his arms.A""Shhh...."" he whispers. ""I love you, I'm going to take care of you, you're so perfect, it's going to be alright.""AJohn's sobs gradually quiet and he falls asleep, curled into his arms.ASherlock sits with him and lets the blood dry.A-=-=-=-ASherlock adores him. Adores everything about him wholeheartedly. He’s not going to let him go now.AJohn touches him the next night. Brings him off with his hand as they lie sprawled on the couch tipsy from Sherlock's special brandy and finishing up Hannibal. Sherlock ignores the psychosis on the screen however to a much more carnal pleasure; that of the hand of the man he loves most on this earth touching him, feeding him pleasure in breathless little sips that leave him moaning and thrusting blindly. After he comes, John gathers him up in his arms and kisses him, and kisses him, and kisses him. Caresses the bruise formed on his left jaw and cries softly into his hair.A""I love you,"" he chokes out. ""I love you so much.""ASherlock doesn't need to hear him say anything else. His declaration is his apology. His saviour damns himself with his own words.ANo matter. Sherlock is happy for them to be dragged down to hell together. The East Wind doesn't know remorse. Only what's ahead.A-=-=-=-=-AJohn calls him Broken. And Beautiful. And Fragile. He sees himself in the mirror every morning, and he knows that he deserves the names. But they are not meant in a hurtful way; Sherlock sees himself more clearly than anyone. Like the shards of a shattered mirror, John says.ABroken, but still beautiful.ABeautiful and deadly.A-=-=-=-=-ANotes: The poem for which this work is named is called The Winds of Fate by Heather Burns.AALife grabbed a heartAtwisting and twirlingA Until shards fellA along its pathwayA Stepping asideA restoration beganA But incompleteA Like a broken mirrorA a thousand pieces A Caught in the windA and blew away.AAA ",Like a Broken Mirror,2972

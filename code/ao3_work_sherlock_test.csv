She gave me permission to write a story based off this au http://anothermindpalace.tumblr.com/post/61781805280/sherlock-au-after-being-abducted-and-tortured.As you can see I've changed it slightly but it was lovely that she allowed me to write this.,2014-02-22, Mature,,"Moriarty wanted revenge, and he wanted it on Mycroft Holmes, however he couldn't simply kidnap the man who ran the British government, so his brother would have to do.","The room was dark and cold and smelt distinctively of mold, mildew and the all too familiar smell of rotting basement. Sherlock sat still on the bed, his ribs and shoulders still aching from being thrown onto the ground and into the boot of a small car where he had to squeeze his knees tight to his chest to make room for the rest of his body. He looked around, trying to deduce something, anything about where he was. But the room was too dimly lit, the only source of light being the thin moon beam that leaked in through the small barred window and he was far too worn out to make out much of anything even if there were proper lighting. A bruisingly large man shoved his way into the room and with a grunt wandered over to where Sherlock was sitting, roughly grabbing his wrist and locking it into a pair of handcuffs, pulling it behind one of the bars of the metal headboard before clamping his other wrist in the other end of the handcuffs. Sherlock twisted himself to get more comfortable, his arms hanging above his head. He watched as the man lumbered back out of the room.ASherlock looked down at himself, accessing if anything else was wrong with him. His coat was missing and he guessed that someone had taken it. He had a large rip in the knee of his right pant leg and a small cut that had stopped bleeding quite some time ago. His shirt was in near perfect condition aside from the large amount of dirt smeared across it. The door opened and a small wiry man came in with a chair, setting it down several feet away from where Sherlock was seated on the bed. The man regarded Sherlock with a sly look before leaving out the door. Sherlock sat for what seemed like hours but he knew could only have been a couple minutes before a dark figure walked into the room, wearing what looked a lot like Sherlock's coat.A“This is a lovely coat you have Sherlock” came the sticky sweet drawl of an all too familiar voice. “It’s a shame that you won’t be needing it for some time” he said, sitting down in the chair in front of Sherlock, crossing his legs. “Though it is a bit drafty in here”A“What do you want Moriarty?” Sherlock asked, gritting his teeth.A“Oh not much” he said, examining his fingernails. “Just revenge”A“On who?”A“Your brother Sherlock dear, your brother” Sherlock let out a shaky laugh that slowly turned into a chuckle.A“And how are you going to do this, there isn’t much my brother cares about” Moriarty laughed, leaning forward in the chair so he was in the small light beam that was coming in through the window.A“Quite right Sherlock but there is one thing he cares about more than he’d like to mention”A“And what’s that?”A“You”A---AJohn paced back and forth in the den of 221b, running his hands nervously through his hair several times before sitting down in his arm chair only to get back up and repeat the process. It wasn’t normal for Sherlock to have been gone this long, granted he’d been gone longer but he said he was heading over to Saint Bart’s, he should have been back by now, at the very least he should have texted by now.AJohn checked his phone for the seventh time since the hour, still no messages from Sherlock. John rubbed his hands over his face, grabbing his coat and hailing a cab. When he reached Scotland Yard he threw some money at the cabbie and dashed in through the doors, bursting into Lestrade’s office without so much as a hello to anyone in the offices.A“Sherlock's gone” John said breathlessly.A“And this is different from any other time because?”A“He said he was going to Saint Bart’s” Lestrade raised an eyebrow, requesting a further explanation. John rolled his eyes, suddenly remembering that not everyone knew Sherlock the way he did. “He left this morning, and it’s almost five, he’s never gone this long without texting”A“Well maybe something’s come up?” John shook his head.A“He would have texted me, or had Molly text me and I haven’t heard anything all day”A“Maybe we should head over there” Lestrade said, standing up and shrugging on his coat. John nodded, following him out the door and into a cab.A---ASherlock twisted in his handcuffs, the cold metal cutting into his wrists. His arms had since gone numb from being in the same position for several hours. The heavy metal door opened and Sherlock wasn’t surprised to see Moriarty walk in with the larger man that had handcuffed him. The large man walked over to the bed, unlocking the cuffs from around Sherlock's wrist. The man grabbed Sherlock's legs, turning him so he was sitting on the edge of the bed, facing the chair.AA table was placed next to the chair and a small black box was placed on top of it. The large man walked over to the door, standing in front of it and crossing his arms over his chest.A“Miss me?” Moriarty asked, walking over to the table, his arms behind his back. “I brought some presents for you” and Sherlock was sure he meant whatever the black box contained. He sat down in the chair, placing his hands in-between his knees. “Now you should know that these are small presents and when you receive them I expect some sort of reaction” he turned to the box, unlatching the top and skimming over the items before picking one up. “This one is quite fun” Moriarty said, turning it around in his hands, the instrument look like a very cruel set of pliers.A“Open wide for daddy Sherlock dear” Sherlock clamped his mouth together, making a show of pulling his lips in. Moriarty sighed and motioned for the burly man by the door to come over. The man lumbered over from the door and stood next to Sherlock, placing his huge, calloused hands on either side of Sherlock’s face.A“Break his jaw sir?” The man asked, his voice low and rumbly.A“No, no I need him to be able to talk” the man nodded, prying Sherlock’s jaw open. “These are lovely teeth you have here Sherlock, which one do I want?”, Sherlock watched, eyes wide with fear as Moriarty placed the pliers on one of his back molars, twisting and quickly pulling. Sherlock cried out, the sound strangled as Sherlock’s mouth was still being held open. Blood poured from the tooth’s former home, dripping down and off Sherlock’s bottom lip.A“Now Sherlock dear this isn’t all I want from you” Moriarty said, placing the piers on the table and nodding at the man. The brooding man let go of Sherlock’s mouth, moving instead to hold his right hand out to Moriarty. Moriarty wiped his hands on a towel that was sitting on the table, before once again picking up the piers, placing them on the tip of Sherlock’s middle finger nail. He pulled back quickly, yanking Sherlock’s nail out all the while keeping eye contact. Sherlock shouted, and cursed, pain shooting up through his arm.A“Thank you” Moriarty said, picking up Sherlock’s tooth and fingernail along with the black box and heading out the door, the man following behind, shutting the thick metal door behind himself.A---A“He never showed up” Molly said, filling out a sheet clipped onto her clip board.A“Are you sure you just didn’t see him come in, maybe you missed him” John said, worry etched into his voice.A“No he never showed up”A“How could he have never showed up” John asked, Lestrade as they walked out of Bart’s. Lestrade shrugged.A“I don’t know John, maybe he got distracted or something” John stopped walking, looking up at Lestrade.A“Do you not even know him?”ALestrade looked nervous but simply shrugged. “I can’t fill out a missing persons report until he’s been gone for forty eight hours”AJohn nodded, understanding the conditions.A“If he’s not back by tomorrow night let me know” Lestrade said, clapping John on the shoulder and heading down the street in the opposite direction of John.",Darkness Rising,12879

Sherlock rubbed at his jaw, sharp pain still shooting through the back of his mouth. His mind ran through reasons why Moriarty would want to keep him captive, skipping over the obvious fact that he was Moriarty and he had a fondness for that sort of thing. Sherlock absentmindedly rubbed at his wrists, hissing in pain at the burning sensation it caused. Sherlock wished he had something it occupy his mind, if only for a little while. The door opened and Sherlock turned sharply in the direction of his only way out. A table was again brought in but nothing was set on it. Sherlock frowned at this but decided it was better that nothing was brought in at this time. The door was again shut and Sherlock was left alone. He paced the length of the room, wondering what Moriarty had planned for him next. After what seemed like hours but in truth was only a few minutes Moriarty slaughtered in, hands behind his back. He placed a syringe on the small black table, filled with a familiar substance. Sherlock's eyes widened with fear as he backed up onto the bed, back pressed against the wall. ""Judging by your reaction I'm going to guess you know what this substance is"" Moriarty said, a sly smiled plastered on his face. ""I don't want that"" Sherlock said, pointing to the syringe. ""I know Sherlock dear that's why it's being given to you""""Please no"" Sherlock said, holding his hands up to protect himself. Moriarty nodded and the man by the door, whom Sherlock hasn't noticed before, walked over to Sherlock, rolling his sleeve up well past his elbow. Sherlock struggled against the man but to no avail. A rubber band was tied around his arm above the elbow and Moriarty reached to grab the syringe. Moriarty quickly found the vane in Sherlock's arm, pushing the needle in past the skin and pushing the stopper on the top down. Moriarty left Sherlock in a state of confusion and Sherlock gathered that he said he'd be back later to check on him, couldn't have him choking in his own vomit or something of the like. ---Sherlock wasn't sure how long it had been before Moriarty came back but he knew it was long enough for the dose he had given him to wear off and long enough for Sherlock to be crawling the walls with want of more. ""It's lovely to see you this way Sherlock"" Sherlock lay on the bed, curled into a tight ball, pulling at his hair. ""Going through withdrawals dear?"" Sherlock groaned and tucked into himself tighter. ""Have a lovely night"" Moriarty said, turning on his heel and leaving through the heavy metal door. ---Lestrade still refused to fill out a missing persons report. ""He's been gone for three days!"" John shouted across the desk at Lestrade. ""This is Sherlock we're talking about he does this all the time.""""No, something's wrong, he would have texted me by now"" ""I'll file one now if it'll make you feel better""""Yes thank you"" John said, watching as Lestrade grabbed some papers and a pen, quickly filling them out. ""I'll have people looking for him""---Sherlock was extremely thirsty, his mouth dry and lips slightly chapped. The need for the drugs tearing his insides apart. He bit at his nails to try and distract himself but his nails didn’t grow quite fast enough and already he'd made three fingers bleed. He had buttoned and unbuttoned his dress shirt seven times already and had chewed his lip to past the bleeding point. He was becoming desperate now as another hour passed, he wished more than anything that Moriarty would come in and give him another dose, even just a small one, anything to stop the craving. Sherlock ran his fingers roughly through his hair, tugging at it, trying to think of something, anything to distract himself. He tried to think of John, tried to wonder if he was worried about him but he couldn't think about John for too long before the cravings kicked in and took over his mind. One of the large men lumbered into the room and grabbed Sherlock by the back of the neck, picking him up from where he lay on the ground, and set him on the bed. Sherlock leaned back against the wall, his eyes sliding closed. Sherlock wasn't sure how long it was before the door opened again, wasn't sure how long it took Moriarty to slaughter over to him, wasn't sure how quickly he leaned down to whisper, only registered the fact that his breath was hot and sticky on his neck and it was all around unpleasant and made his skin crawl with disgust. He registered that Moriarty said something along the lines of three days, three days since the last dose. He felt the sharp tip of the needle enter his skin and the drug enter his system. Sherlock could feel Moriarty smile against his cheek. Registered that Moriarty had placed a chaste kiss on the shell of his ear before leaving out the door. ---Sherlock muddled through the high and through his withdrawal to discover that since the last dose it had been six days. He could only guess that Moriarty's new form of torture was forcibly injecting drugs into his system and leaving him with longer withdrawals. Sherlock perked up when he heard the metal door groan open. He was confused when only Moriarty walked in, holding nothing but Sherlock's cell phone. He crouched down to be level with Sherlock, tilting his head slightly as Sherlock was laying on the bed. ""One phone call Sherlock dear"" Moriarty said, handing him the phone. Sherlock fumbled with the phone, shakily typing in the numbers he had memorized. Sherlock sighed with relief when he heard John pick up on the other end. ""Hi John""""Sherlock where the hell are you? You've been gone for a week and a half""""I think I'm in a basement"" Sherlock said lazily. He heard John pause on the other end of the phone. ""Sherlock are you high?"" Sherlock shook his head for a moment before remembering that John couldn't see him. ""No, not on drugs not right now""""Not right now, Sherlock"" Sherlock heard John's voice trail off as Moriarty grabbed the phone out of his hand, placing it against his ear. ---John was shocked when the phone rang and Sherlock's number popped up. His first reaction was to be angry but Sherlock sounded so lost that John couldn't be mad for long. ""Sherlock are you high?"" John asked, his heart clenching at the very thought. ""No not on drugs not right now""""Not right now? Jesus Sherlock"" John jumped when Moriarty's sticky sweet voice met him on the other end of the line. ""Hello Johnny Boy""""Hello"" John said questioningly. ""I have your precious Sherlock, he's been quite good, very compliment as of late.""""Don't you hurt him"" John said through gritted teeth. ""Oh no Johnny not yet, not yet but soon enough, don't you worry your pretty little head""---Moriarty hung up, tucking the phone into his suit pocket. Moriarty turned back to Sherlock, leaning down to look at Sherlock, his hands placed on his knees. ""What should we do tomorrow hmm? The real fun starts tomorrow"" he said, patting Sherlock's cheek before heading out the door. ---Sherlock was once again handcuffed to the flimsy metal headboard and two of Moriarty’s large side kicks came in, standing on either side of the heavy metal door. Sherlock pulled himself up into a sitting position, groaning quietly as the cuffs dug into his wrists. The men watched him from the door, the one checking his wrist every now and again. After what seemed like an hour Moriarty slaughter in. He nodded his head and they moved from the doorway, uncuffing Sherlock from the bed and re-cuffing him to a section of the wall. Moriarty wandered over and stretched his fingers. A silver set of brass knuckles sat snugly against Moriarty's knuckles on his right hand and sliver of fear rang through Sherlock. Moriarty stretched his fingers out, examining the back of his hand. Moriarty wrenched his arm back and Sherlock braced himself for the impact. The cool metal slammed hard against his jaw and he could already taste the metallic sting of blood. Moriarty wrenched back again and placed another blow to Sherlock's left cheek. He placed several more blows on his face before moving down to hit his sides and stomach. Moriarty stood back, examining his work before slipping the brass knuckles off his hand and handing them to his henchman. Moriarty gripped Sherlock's chin, tilting it up and forcing him to look him in the eye. ""You're an easily broken pet aren't you? You'll learn to become quite submissive and compliant"" Moriarty said sweetly, releasing Sherlock jaw. With a wave of his hand and a nod Sherlock was released from the wall and left on the cold concrete. ---The only thing John could think to do while he was waiting for Sherlock to be found, was eat. He was sure he'd gained ten pounds since Sherlock was taken, given that all he'd been eating was fish and chips and the occasional take away along with at least twenty cups of tea a day. Mrs. Hudson worried about and and tried several times to get him to eat something other than fast food but John refused. Several times John thought about going for a run but couldn't muster up enough energy to actually go through with it. Occasionally Lestrade would stop by with snippets of information about where Sherlock might be but it all was seemingly useless. Wherever Sherlock was John hopped he was okay.",Darkness Rising,12879

Sherlock was struggling to keep himself up on all fours as Moriarty placed calculated blow after calculated blow to Sherlock’s sides and face. In the back corners of his mind Sherlock registered how disgusting it was that there was a thick stream of blood flowing from his mouth, mingling with his spit and dripping of his bottom lip into a puddle on the cold concrete floor. Moriarty kicked up into Sherlock’s stomach and he let out a puff of air and fell over onto the floor. Moriarty squatted down, watching as Sherlock writhed on the floor, clutching his stomach. “Oh Sherlock” Moriarty said crouching down on the floor next to Sherlock. He gently brushed hair off of Sherlock's bloodied forehead and Sherlock visibly curled away from his touch. ""I really don't want to do this to you love"" ""Then stop"" Sherlock gurgled, spitting out a thick stream of blood. Moriarty shook his head. ""I have to do this Sherlock dear"" Moriarty said, placing a hand on Sherlock's bloodied face, rubbing his thumb gently over Sherlock's bruised cheekbone. Sherlock weakly tried to push Moriarty's hand off his face but greatly failed. “Shall I place you on the bed dear, I don’t think the floor is going to be very comfortable.” Sherlock tried his hardest to protest Moriarty’s help but he didn’t really want to lay on the floor and he wasn’t sure of his own strength. Moriarty carefully picked him up off the floor and laid him on the bed. He brushed hair off Sherlock’s forehead, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead before leaving the room, closing the door behind himself. ---Sherlock was left alone for roughly a week, only being bothered when he was given food. The cuts on his sides had healed but he still had quite a few large angry looking bruises along his sides. The swelling in his face had gone down considerably but it was still sore and bruised. He lay on the bed, wondering vaguely if John was looking for him. Moriarty walked in through the heavy metal door, dragging a chair behind himself. He faced the chair backwards in front of the flimsy bed Sherlock was spread out on, straddling it and resting his arms on the back of the chair. “How ya feeling Sherlock?” Moriarty asked in that annoying sing-song voice he possesed.“Fuck you” “Ooo, getting a tad sassy are we?” Sherlock groaned and pressed his face into his pillow. “Still sore?” Sherlock though he didn’t want to, nodded. “Well tomorrow we’ll have some real fun”---Heavy metal handcuffs were clamped around Sherlock’s wrists and his arms were pulled above his head, hooked to something in the ceiling.Sherlock’s shirt had been removed and he was sure that a thorough beating was in order. Moriarty took great pleasure in administering the beatings himself and this time was no different. His ever crisp, clean suit was what he wore and he walked in with a whip. He unrolled it and Sherlock heard the leather hit the floor. He heard the leather whistle through the stale air and flinched when it made contact with his bare skin. He heard it whiz through the air again and snap across the small of his back. He let out a small whimper and he could feel the air nipping at his wounds with the sickening promise of infection. Sherlock counted ten more lashes across his back and two across both shoulders before he heard Moriarty rolled the whip up and unhooked Sherlock from the ceiling and handcuffs. Moriarty pressed a stinging kiss against one of the more nasty cuts and Sherlock hissed in pain. “These might scar Sherlock” he said, brushing his fingers lightly over the split skin and Sherlock bit his lip to suppress a whimper. ---There wasn’t a comfortable position Sherlock could rest in. Should he stretch too far the open wounds would split and widen and cause severe discomfort. Sherlock was currently laying on his stomach, arms slack by his sides. Though most of his attention was spent on trying to keep his wounds from splitting he realized that he was terribly hungry. Suddenly he longed to John's annoying pestering about eating something and he promised himself to never complain about it again. He wondered vaguely if Moriarty would ever let him go, no probably not, and for a moment he wondered if he'd ever be found or if he would simply waste away. Sherlock prayed to a god he didn't believe in that he would be found, that someone, anyone, god even Anderson, would find him. Sherlock's back itched but he dared not move from his current position, knowing full well that if he did, it would cause further and future discomfort. ---One of the cuts on Sherlock’s back had gotten infected and Moriarty caved and allowed someone to come in and take care of it, putting a clean dressing on it three times a day. However this act of “kindness” came with another more subtle punishment. Sherlock was denied food. He was already fairly skinny even when he was allowed to eat whenever he pleased but now he felt as if his ribs were going to poke through his skin at any moment but then again he could have just been being dramatic. His stomach complained angrily at him and he sighed in annoyance. ""Shut up"" he mumbled hoarsely to his stomach. ""I have nothing to give you""""Are you talking to yourself?"" Sherlock quickly looked up, the action making his head spin, his gaze catching Moriarty's. ""You're starving me and you've denied me human communication of course I'm talking to myself"" ""Well then you should know that I have a present for you"" Sherlock's brow rose high on his head, nearly disappearing into his hairline. ""And by present do you mean an actual gift or another beating?""""If your going to be rude about it I won't give it to you"" Sherlock clamped his mouth shut. Moriarty reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out Sherlock's mobile, flipping it around in his hand. ""One person Sherlock dear, one"". Moriarty slowly exited the room and Sherlock wondered briefly why Moriarty trusted him not to call more than one person. Sherlock licked his dry, cracked lips and slowly dialed John's number. ""Hello?""""John"" Sherlock breathed. ---""Sherlock, what, where?"" John scrambled, sitting up so fast he fell off the couch. ""John"" Sherlock said again. John picked himself off the floor, shoving his fist into his mouth, biting down hard, but it didn't stop the tears from leaking out of the corners of his eyes.""Are you okay?"" John choked out. ""No, no I'm not""“How did you call me?”“He let me” John let out a small sigh of relief.“I’m so sorry Sherlock, I’m so sorry”“Me too John, me too”--- Sherlock nearly began crying when Moriarty came back in and snached the phone out of his hand. Moriarty talked on the phone with John for a few more minutes before hanging up and tucking it into the inside pocket of his sleek black suit jacket. ""Little Johnny boy misses you Sherlock dear"" Sherlock glared and shuffled himself on the bed. ""How's your back?"" Sherlock grumbled and rolled onto his stomach. Moriarty gently removed the bandage on Sherlock's back and examined the wound. He gently ran his hands along his back and Sherlock winched. The wounds were nearly healed, they were scabbed over and they still hurt like a bitch but they were healing. Moriarty lightly traced each wound with his delicate fingers, scanning over them as if memorizing the exact places he had injured Sherlock, as if he was trying to memorize the exact places he had inflicted pain. He kissed one of the cuts and curtly exited the room.",Darkness Rising,12879

I'll try to update every-other week. Reviews would be great and will make me write faster.,2014-02-22, Mature,,"Moriarty wanted revenge, and he wanted it on Mycroft Holmes, however he couldn't simply kidnap the man who ran the British government, so his brother would have to do.","Sherlock was never one for crying but this new form of torture was a new all time low for Moriarty. Sherlock had been blindfolded and taken to a different part of wherever the hell they were. A room with a furnace. He had his arms chained above his head and been stripped out of nearly all his clothes. Moriarty was currently taking a iron, heating it up in the open fire and sticking it against different places on Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock cried out as Moriarty placed the hot iron against his hip, holding it there longer than he had the other times. Sherlock’s skin was on fire and welted in several spots from the fire. On top of burning him Moriarty thought it was quite delightful to gash him open and burn the wound closed. Moriarty however was slightly considerate as he stayed away from burning his back. Moriarty stopped for a moment, handing the iron to one of his henchman and leaning in close to Sherlock’s face. “I want you to beg for it” Moriarty whispered close to Sherlock’s ear. “I want you to beg for mercy and when I think you’ve done a sufficient job I will stop” Moriarty reached back and grabbed the iron from his henchman and stuck it in the fire, placing it across Sherlock’s stomach. Sherlock screamed. “Please” Sherlock said breathlessly, a slight whimper in his tone. “Please” “Please what Sherlock?” Moriarty asked, grabbing Sherlock’s chin and tipping his face up, placing the hot iron against his left side. Sherlock let out a loud shout and Moriarty smiled at his discomfort. “Please, please no more, please I can’t take anymore, please” the last please was whispered quietly and Moriarty smiled, placing a light kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. “There we go”---John stumbled up the stairs, listing to one side with the weight of the grouchies he bought but probably wouldn’t eat most of. He walked into the kitchen and placed the bags from Tesco on the counter frowning at where the kettle sat as he thought he let it on the counter, not the stove top. John turn and gasped upon seeing Moriarty smiling at him from where he sat with his legs crossed in Sherlock’s chair, holding a mug of what John supposed was tea. John pulled his gun out of the back of his pants and aimed it at Moriarty, quickly walking to the back of his chair. “What the hell are you doing here?” “Came for a chat” Moriarty said cheerily. “You can put away the gun Jonny Boy if I wanted you dead you never wouldn’t have left the flat this morning.” John slowly lowered his gun but kept it in his hand. Moriarty motioned to John’s chair and John sat wearily.“Chat about what?” John asked curiously.“Sherlock of course” John’s expression turned stormy and he motioned for Moriarty to continue. “He’s doing quite well” Moriarty said with a sarcastic smile plastered across his face. “We had some fun with a hot iron yesterday” John restrained himself from jumping out of his chair and strangling Moriarty where he sat, clenching and unclenching his fist, tensing his jaw.“He keeps asking for you, you know. Wants to come back home and spend some time with you.” “Why, why are you doing this?” Moriarty shrugged. “It started out being because of revenge but lately it’s been sort of a fun game” John shook his head. “He’s become very good at begging” “Get out of my flat” John said angrily and low in a voice that tended to make a normal person shrivel away. Moriarty smiled and set his mug down, standing up slowly, fixing his suit. “Nice having this chat”---“He said it was about revenge Mycroft, revenge on whom exactly?” John was sat in a just-so-comfortable office chair on the other side of Mycroft’s expensive cherry wood desk. “This might have something to do with me” Mycroft said calmly. John frowned, slowly trying to put the pieces together in his mind. “Explain” John said after a moment of trying to figure out what Mycroft had meant. “I had Moriarty in my possession and was trying to gather information from him so I would assume that this is payback for that.” Anger boiled up inside of John and he glared at Mycroft. “So this is your fault?” “If I had known that he would kidnap my brother do you honestly believe that I would have tried getting anything out of Moriarty?” “Seems like something you’d do just to insure the kidnap of your brother.” Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Look it doesn’t matter really, because it’s getting worse for Sherlock from what I hear Moriarty had “fun” “playing” with a hot poker on Sherlock’s bare skin.” Mycroft cringed slightly at John’s statement. “So I don’t know pull some strings and try to help find your brother”---Sherlock heard the riding crop whiz through the air and felt it land hard across his back for the twelfth time. Sherlock was struck three more times before Moriarty left the room. Sherlock lay on the cold cement floor, his sweaty cheek pressed against the cold of the ground, his body failing to obey the constant command of standing and walking to the bed. Sherlock whimpered slightly as he propped himself up and crawled over to the bed, pulling himself up and laying down on the dingy mattress. Sherlock absently let his mind wander and thought about John. He was probably worried and he was probably eating himself into a stupor and Mrs. Hudson was probably worrying a ton about him. Emotions weren’t for Sherlock he didn’t need them and he didn’t show them but now he allowed the tears to flow freely, running down his cheeks and dripping off his chin, letting out small whimpers. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to return to 221B and have John push tea and food into his space and have Mrs. Hudson fuss over him. He wouldn’t even mind seeing Mycroft at this point. He was broken and worn and he knew it and if he knew it then so did Moriarty and it would only be a matter of time before he decided to break him completely.---John replayed the CCTV footage again for probably the twelfth time. He still couldn't believe how easily Sherlock had been subdued. John was suddenly furious. Furious that it had taken Mycroft this long to think something  was amiss. Furious that it had taken Mycroft this long to even look at the CCTV cameras. John stared angrily across at Mycroft, handing him back the tablet that he'd been watching the footage on. ""How could it have taken you this long to notice, this long to even consider thinking something was wrong? Even after I told you, you didn't believe me."" John said through clenched teeth. ""Sherlock likes to play games with me, this isn't the first time he's disappeared and it certainly won't be the last""""You don't understand!"" John shouted suddenly, standing up abruptly enough to cause Mycroft to flinch. ""This isn't a game you fucking idiot! This is Sherlock's life we're talking about!""""I do hope you will lower your voice and sit down"" Mycroft said calmly but firmly with authority.

(Though I'm thinking of a two parter),2014-02-22, Mature,,"Moriarty wanted revenge, and he wanted it on Mycroft Holmes, however he couldn't simply kidnap the man who ran the British government, so his brother would have to do.","Sherlock had been strapped down to a board, his head tilted back and his feet slightly in the air. A towel had been put over his face. Panic began to set in and Sherlock wondered what was to come. He heard someone come into the room and for a moment he thought about crying out for help before he heard the all too familiar bone chilling chuckle. “Oh Sherlock my dear I wish you could see yourself right now,” Moriarty said, his voice light as he reached down and lightly drug his fingers along Sherlock’s chest. “You look absolutely helpless” Sherlock could hear some sort of metal being dropped on the floor and fear rose up in his chest, and he could feel it constrict his breathing. He suddenly felt the all too familiar-ness of water on his face and he gasped in shock. Before he could properly catch his breath another bucket of freezing cold water was poured onto his face. He gasped and sputtered and struggled against his bonds. He heard Moriarty chuckle and a shiver of fear ran up his spine. He was going to drown him, he was going to die right here and now, in this humiliating position and they would probably dump his body and at some point John would stop looking for him. Sherlock gasped and arched up before falling back against the board he was strapped to. Another bucket was poured onto his face and Sherlock gasped. He felt as though his lungs were fillings with water and the rational part of his brain screamed at him that he was fine, he was being water-boarded, he wasn’t really drowning, but all he could do was panic like a trapped animal and that was exactly what Moriarty wanted him to do. The water was poured on in intervals over the course of the next hour and a half before the soaking wet towel was pulled off his face. Sherlock squinted at the dim light at glared down at him from the ceiling and frowned when Moriarty leaned over him, smiling like always. “Hello Sherlock. Did you have fun?”“Eat shit” Sherlock spat, his voice hoarse from lack of use. “Sherlock dear you’re becoming simply animalistic” ---Sherlock wanted to go home, Sherlock wanted to be with John, Sherlock loathed that he hadn’t been more careful that morning. He wasn’t scared so much with the torture anymore, that was normal now. The thought that absolutely terrified him was the thought that maybe no one was even looking for him, he knew it was sentiment but it was the thought that pulled at the four corners of his mind and he could not escape the thought no matter how hard he tried. It had been two months and Moriarty had not even hinted at the thought. Though if his brother and whoever else was looking for him and they didn’t have the foggiest clue of where he was then how could there be talk of it, there would be no reason for Moriarty to even bring up the topic. The door to the room he was locked in suddenly opened and one of Moriarty’s large lagies walked in and placed handcuffs around Sherlock’s thin wrists before pushing him forward and making him walk down a hall. Sherlock tried to memorize all the twists and turns they took but it was seemingly endless and everything looked the same, nothing to distinguish any difference, all cold cement walls and leaky ceilings. Sherlock was sure of one thing though, they were somewhere underground. Sherlock was pushed into a room that was lit by several candles and bare save a small table with a non-descript table cloth whereupon sat soap and shampoo and a tub. Sherlock was left in the room, handcuffs still on, and out of curiosity he walked over to the bathtub and peered inside. The tub was filled with water and Sherlock stuck a finger in to test the warmth. Nearly scalding, recently filled. The door opened and shut and Sherlock turned to see who had entered. “What is this?” Sherlock asked. “It’s a tub Sherlock surely your mind hasn’t left you” Moriarty answered, walking over to the tub and sitting on the edge, running his hand through the hot water.“Yes, but what am I doing here?”“You’re to bathe Sherlock”“And what if I refuse?” Sherlock asked, straightening himself. Moriarty quirked an eyebrow and Sherlock knew that he wouldn’t be allowed to refuse, why would he want to? It would be his first bath in two months, it would feel lovely. Moriarty walked over and unlocked the cuffs, letting them fall to the floor with a small metal thunk. Moriarty leaned forward and whispered close to Sherlock’s ear. “Undress” Sherlock swallowed thickly, he had never really cared if people saw him naked but the thought of being naked now, in his presence sent shivers down the detective’s spine. Sherlock slowly began unbuttoning his shirt before slipping it off and letting it fall to the floor. He unbuckled his belt and watched at Moriarty sat on the edge of the tub, flicking water about. Sherlock too let his trousers fall to the floor, standing alone in his pants. He sighed and swallowed before slipping them off as well. The cold very quickly began to seep into Sherlock’s skin, chilling him and causing goose flesh to rise up on his skin. He longed for the heat of the bath but he had not been told he was allowed to get in. So there he stood. “Get in” Sherlock padded over to the tub and slowly, and shakily, got into the tub. He sighed and sank down into the water. Moriarty walked over to the table and grabbed a bar of soap and a washcloth. Moriarty sat back on the edge of the tub. He wetted the washcloth and squeezed it out across Sherlock’s back. Sherlock gasped and straightened his back, shivering as the water trickled down his back. “Sherlock” Moriarty addressed softly. Sherlock hummed in response. “I’m gonna take care of you, really good care of you” Moriarty leaned forward and placed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, smoothing down Sherlock’s tangled hair. “You’ll let me do that won’t you?” Moriarty asked softly against the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “You’ll let me take care of you?”“I’m not exactly in a position to argue am I?” “Of course not Sherlock, but I would like you to be compliant” Sherlock nodded, once in understanding, and another time in compliance. Moriarty poured water over Sherlock’s hair, soaking it before squirting a generous amount of shampoo into his palm, scrubbing it into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock closed his eyes and relished the feel of being cleaned and imagined for a moment that it was John scrubbing the soap into his hair, imagined that it was John who was taking care of him, after all this had blown over. He was brought back to the present by water being poured over his head. Moriarty rinsed the soap out of his hair and cleaned out the cuts on his torso that hadn’t quite healed yet. Moriarty wandered over to the small table and pulled off a towel, instructing Sherlock to stand. Sherlock stood and Moriarty wrapped the towel around his shoulders, drying his shoulders, moving to his neck then his head, making him step out of the tub so he could dry the rest of him. He took longer drying the insides of Sherlock’s thighs than was strictly necessary and it made Sherlock far too uncomfortable. He finished drying Sherlock and instructed him to put his clothes back on. Sherlock did as he was told and slipped his dirty clothes back on, suddenly feeling as though the bath was now null and void because he felt just as dirty as he had before. He followed Moriarty back into his room and found that food had been brought in for him. Sherlock turned to look at Moriarty, wondering suddenly if perhaps this had all been a trick. “I told you I’d take care of you Sherlock” Sherlock sat down on the bed and pulled the small metal table that the food was on closer to him, eating faster than he ever had in his life. Within a few minutes all the food was completely gone, the plate nearly licked clean. “There you go love” Moriarty said, smoothing down Sherlock’s hair, a gesture and would soon become far too familiar. ---John walked into Sherlock’s room and sat down on the edge of his bed, picking up whatever happened to be on his night stand. He needed a moment of peace. 221B was crawling with police and secret service and Mrs. Hudson buzzing about his face asking if he was okay wasn’t helping the matter at all in the least. He wanted to find Sherlock he really and truly did, but this was too much.There were too many people buzzing about who were only being paid to look for him, they didn’t actually care if he was found, they only cared if they would be getting their next paycheck sometime soon. John sighed and layed back on Sherlock’s bed, staring up at the ceiling. There was an urgent knock on the door and John sighed, rolling out of the bed and opening the door. It was Mycroft. Of course it was. “What?” John said, rubbing at his face. “We found his coat” John perked up slightly. “Where is it?” Mycroft extended his arm and there it was. The beautiful belstaff that could only belong to one person. John longed to see the man who always so mysteriously tucked himself his beloved coat, who turned up his coat collar to look cool, John would give anything to have him back. John reached out and took the coat bringing it to his face and breathing in the lingering scent that was purely Sherlock. “Have you run any lab tests on it?”John asked softly, the coat still close to his face. “We’re working on it right now”“So I can keep this then?” Mycroft nodded and John retracted into the bedroom, closing the door. He sat down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed and pressed the coat into his face. The comforting smell of Sherlock enveloped John and he breathed, just breathed. He reached into the pockets and pulled out Sherlock’s scarf, wrapping it around his neck. He slipped on Sherlock’s coat and laid down on the bed and despite everything that was happening, he slept.",Darkness Rising,12879

Moriarty wouldn’t administer the punishments anymore, no he would “save” Sherlock from them. Sherlock was terrified, he knew it would only be a matter of time before his brain gave and he did not want to be present when it did. Sherlock was struggling to keep air in his lungs, the noose around his neck constricting the air flow. The stool that had been placed under his feet allowed him just enough leverage to keep him from choking. Sherlock wasn’t sure how long he’d been hanging there for, just knew that it was long enough for his lungs to want to stop working.Moriarty wandered into the room and tilted the stool away from Sherlock’s feet ever so slightly, causing Sherlock to gasp and grab at the rope around his neck and grab at Moriarty. Moriarty switched out Sherlock’s stool for a taller one and Sherlock was finally able to relieve the stress on his neck. Sherlock gasped and coughed, trying to loosen the noose around his neck. Moriarty reached up and loosened and removed the rope and Sherlock fell unceremoniously to the ground, on all fours, panting and coughing.“Why?” Sherlock rasped, rubbing at his neck. Moriarty squatted down to Sherlock’s level, grabbing a large handful of his dark hair, pulling his head back.“Because this is how you are to be treated, so that I can care for you” Sherlock whimpered as the grip on his hair tightened. “You will learn to become dependent upon me” Moriarty whispered, close to Sherlock’s ear, his cheek pressed against Sherlock’s. “You will learn to love me”---“I don’t want to eat Mrs. Hudson, I’m not hungry” John said, pushing at the food that had been presented to him.“John, please it’s been three days” John shook his head and stood up from the table, taking his tea and moving to his arm chair.Mrs. Hudson gave Mycroft a look and shook her head before heading back to her own flat.“John,”“Don’t give me the speech”“You need to keep yourself healthy. When we find Sherlock, he’s going to need you, need you to be strong and you can’t do that if you’re sick” Mycroft shouted the last bit as John had gotten up and shut himself in Sherlock’s room. John flopped himself on top of Sherlock’s coat and breathed in the fleeting scent that had soothed him for the past four days. John tucked himself into Sherlock’s blankets and ignored the conversations on the other side of the door.---Moriarty had plans for Sherlock, special plans. He was going to twist that beautiful mind so it only trusted him, so that even if his dear brother did find them, Sherlock wouldn’t want to leave. It wasn’t everyday that you got to tear down the mental walls of an intellectual equal, and Moriarty was quite enjoying himself.---John stood under the stream of the shower long after the water turned cold. He was trying to wash the loneliness and longing off his skin but even the scalding heat couldn’t fix it. Gooseflesh starting raising on John’s skin and he sighed and shut off the shower, stepping out and wrapping a towel around his waist.He quickly dressed in the privacy of the bathroom as his flat was still swarming with secret service and Mycroft. He wandered into the kitchen, his hair still damp and set about making himself a cuppa. He took longer than normal to get his tea ready and he was quite ready to deal with the impending doom of news that they’d tried to force on him yesterday. He sighed as he sat down, lightly sipping his tea. Once he was finally noticed Mycroft gravitated toward him, sitting down in Sherlock’s chair across from him.“We have some news” Mycroft stated. John merely nodded in understand, encouraging Mycroft to continue. “It appears that Moriarty has been spotted going in and out of an old string factory quite frequently.” John cocked an eyebrow.“And this has what to do with Sherlock?”“We believe he might be being held there.”“Might? So what you’re telling me is that there’s the slightest chance that he could, know now, not be there” Mycroft sighed and his jaw tensed.“John,”“I want you to be one hundred percent sure before we burst into one of Moriarty’s operations because he could take him and hide him and we be right back to where we started and then we’d never get Sherlock back” John tried to keep his cool, he really did but Mycroft’s lack of trying was starting to get on every one of his nerves.“Do try to understand that I am doing everything within my power and capabilities to try and find him. Do you not think that I care about his safety as much as you do?” John shook his head and stared down into his tea. “I will make sure that we find him John, that I can promise you.”---John was still sleeping in Sherlock’s room even though his smell was nearly wore out of the sheets by now. It was still comforting somehow, to sleep in his best friend’s bed, even if lately he hadn’t been doing much sleeping.Nightmares would keep him awake at night and refuse to let go of it’s hold on his subconscious. John rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his palms, god he was tired. He sighed and tucked himself down under the blankets and attempted sleep.---Distent screaming, cold air and walls closing in around him. Running, running, running around the maze of never ending twists and turns, sharp corner and blurred edges. The cement floor making his shoes seem louder than they really were.Running, running, had to find him, had to save him. Needed to make sure he was safe. He burst into the door when he finally found it. He was there, sitting alone on the cold cement floor, beaten and bruised, battered and abused.But there he was. He heaved a sigh of relief and walked towards him, arms outstretched. And he screamed, he shied away from his hands and he screamed.---John bolted up, the blankets tangled around him. He was panting and his heart beating so fast and so wild he was sure that it would fly up and out of his chest. He fell back against the pillows and tried to regain his breathing. A dream, only a dream. But it had felt so real and Sherlock had looked so scared and John’s only hope was that he wouldn’t refuse him when they finally did find him.---",Darkness Rising,12879

Sherlock was fairly certain that there wasn’t a single inch of his body that hadn’t been abused. He was currently sitting in a very nice room, a room with high ceilings and warm colours, large windows and comfortable furniture. He didn’t even really mind that the man who had done this to him was currently combing through the tangles of his hair, rubbing his head. Sherlock wanted to lean back into the touch, but the touch wasn’t warm, the touch wasn’t comforting, the touch was lies and evil and hurt.The touch was beatings and bruises, scars and burns, broken skin and infected wounds. Once his hair had been thoroughly combed through Moriarty instructed him to lay on the couch and place his head in his lap. Sherlock did as he was told, knowing the consequences of not obeying orders. Moriarty traced the scabs, the scars and bruises on Sherlock’s face, smiling smugly. “Sherlock,” Sherlock looked up at his captor. “You know I care about you right?”“Yes” Moriarty’s open palm came down hard across Sherlock’s cheek. “You will address me as Sir.” Sherlock reached up and rubbed his cheek. “Now answer the question Sherlock dear”“Yes Sir” Sherlock said quietly, still rubbing his stinging cheek. He’d had worse than the slap but it had come unexpected and hard and he simply wasn’t prepared. Moriarty carded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, gentle and soothing.   ---Mycroft’s mobile beeped with a text alert from where it sat on the side table. He frowned and picked it up. He opened the message and downloaded the three pictures that were waiting for him. They were of Sherlock, beaten, bruised and bloodied. Mycroft sighed, setting his phone down and scrubbing his hands over his face. His mobile jingled and he reached over and answered it. “Hello?”“Hello Mr.Holmes, I trust you’re having a good day?”“What do you need Moriarty?”“Need? I don’t need anything I have everything I need right here. Red is a rather fitting shade on your little brother don’t you think?”“Let him go” Mycroft said, his voice stern.“Let him go? Hmm no I don’t think so, he’s become such a nice little pet. You should hear him beg, it’s adorable” Mycroft heard the click and listened to the emptiness at the end of the line for several moments before sinking down into his chair and sighing deeply. ---   Sherlock took hit after hit to his face, the last one tipping the chair he was tied to onto the floor. He gasped out when the heel of a boot was pushed down into his stomach. He tasted the metallic sting of blood as the boot was pushed harder into his stomach, making him cough up blood, the thick red matter smearing his chin. Moriarty tisked from where he sat on Sherlock’s dingy bed. “Oh Sherlock, sweetie.” Moriarty said, standing up and crouching over Sherlock. “You look absolutely pathetic” He ran his hand down the left side of Sherlock’s face, watching as he coughed and sputtered. “Would you like some help Sherlock dear?” Sherlock nodded. “Then you know how to ask”“Please,” Sherlock wheezed. “Please sir, help me” Moriarty nodded and the weight on Sherlock’s chest lightened and he coughed, getting more air into his lungs. Moriarty assisted in the sitting up process and patted Sherlock's back as he coughed some more.""There we go love, get it all out"" Moriarty said, rubbing Sherlock's back before drawing him into his chest and soothing him. ---Sherlock was warm and content and he willed his eyes to stay shut, he didn't want to know what part of this hell hole Moriarty had drug him to. Sherlock snuggled further into the warm blanket and let his mind drift into 221B, he thought of the warm fire, thought of John's warm smile and wished again that he was home. A hand was rubbing at his back and he slowly opened his eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them. A hand was run through his hair and the owner of the said appendage sighed. ""Sherlock are you aware of how peaceful you look when you're sleeping? "" Moriarty asked in that irritating sing-songy Irish tone he possessed. Sherlock sighed and shook his head. Moriarty grabbed a handful of Sherlock's hair and wrenched his head back, exposing his neck and causing Sherlock to cry out. ""Oh pet, you're absolutely lovely"" Sherlock whimpered and Moriarty smiled, leaning down a placing a kiss on Sherlock's neck, over his adam's apple. Sherlock swallowed thickly, his body betraying his mind. Moriarty traced lightly down Sherlock's neck, teasing around the collar of his shirt. He nipped lightly at the soft skin on Sherlock's neck, his hands moving to undo the buttons of Sherlock's shirt, exposing the bruised and scarred skin of Sherlock's chest. Moriarty placed his open palm on Sherlock's abdomen, curling his fingers into Sherlock's soft skin. He moved his mouth up to Sherlock’s ear and whispered, “I think I’m going to take you tomorrow”WARNING!---Sherlock was given a bath before being tied naked, face down on a random bed in a random room. It was degrading and dirty and Sherlock was absolutely freezing. Sherlock heard the door open and close and listened as Moriarty instructed his men to wait outside the door and not to open it no matter what they heard. He listened to the shuffling of Moriarty’s clothes and shuddered slightly. Before Sherlock understood what was happening there was weight on the back of his thighs and Moriarty’s surprisingly warm hands on either cheek of his arse. Moriarty rubbed his thumbs in small circles before spreading Sherlock’s cheeks apart. Sherlock squirmed when Moriarty licked his opening, it felt dirty, if felt wrong and Sherlock didn’t like it one bit but he was well aware of what was going to happen and if he knew anything about Moriarty he knew this wouldn’t be the only time something like this would happen. Sherlock heard what he assumed was was the cap of a lube bottle being opened before he heard the wet sounds of Moriarty slicking himself up. Sherlock attempted to brace himself for the impact when he felt the tip of Moriarty’s dick pressed against his entrance. Sherlock screamed as Moriarty shoved his way in, even with Moriarty slicked up Sherlock had not been prepared and it felt as if he were being torn in two. Tears welled up in Sherlock’s eyes and he tried to place himself elsewhere but the constant pounding into his backside was hard to ignore. Sherlock bit into his lip in an attempt to stop his tears but they would not, they trailed down his cheeks and made his body shake but it did nothing to deter the madman pounding into him. Sherlock tried to picture Moriarty as someone else, someone who loved him, but no, someone who loved him would never treat him in such a way as this, using his body as an object. Moriarty gripped tightly onto Sherlock’s hips, thrusting even faster into Sherlock’s body, causing the bed to shake. With a few more violent thrusts Moriarty came inside of Sherlock before pulling out and quickly wiping himself up, untying Sherlock and leaving. ---For the first time since Sherlock was seven he sobbed. He sobbed on that dirty bed as Moriarty’s come dried on the insides of his thighs, he curled into himself and let lose everything he’d ever held back, angry sobbing that quickly turned into screaming, for so long and so loud that it left his throat dry and ragged, he screamed until no more noise came out and continued long after that.",Darkness Rising,12879

John was weary of the silence, it left him far too much time to think about things. He missed Sherlock, missed him dearly. As much as John hated most of his antics he missed them. He wanted Sherlock home, home and safe where Mrs. Hudson could smother him with affection and where John could worry about him and where Sherlock could complain. He was still wearing Sherlock’s coat, in fact he hardly taken it off at all. It was comforting somehow, as though Sherlock were still there in some distant way. Mycroft had said they had a lead and was snooping around to try and find out more information but John worried that if they wasted any more time there wouldn’t be any Sherlock left to rescue. --- “It’s a delicate situation John” Mycroft tried to explain gently to the irate army doctor pacing about. “A delicate situation!” John shouted, rage suddenly bubbling to the surface. “Bull shit Mycroft! You have every capability of going and getting him. There doesn’t need to be any bargaining.” “John,” “He’s been there for three months!” “Don’t you think I know that?” Mycroft said, his tone raising just a tad, not shouting or yelling, not really, just loud enough to be frightening. “He is my brother and despite what you may think I do care a great deal about him and I want him home safe just as much as you do.” --- Sherlock was unsure of exactly how much time had passed since he’d been kidnapped but he was sure that it was quite a long while. He was sore and tired and just wanted to go home, but that wasn’t a possibility, at least not right now. Sherlock sighed and curled into himself more, cold given the fact that Moriarty had taken his clothes when he had defiled him and had not yet given them back and Sherlock thought it was likely he would never get them back. Sherlock had newly forming bruises on his hips, dark purple finger marks and he was sure that he would have scars around his wrists given the amount of times he’d been tied to things for varying amounts of time. Sherlock had lost a considerable amount of weight, which was dangerous given that he hadn’t weighed a whole lot when he’d first been taken. It wasn’t that Moriarty wasn’t feeding him, he just wasn’t feeding him everyday and when he did it wasn’t a whole lot and nothing too nourishing. Sherlock’s bum hurt but it was a sort of ache that he could ignore for a little while and he still felt sticky and dirty, he tried to forget what Moriarty had done to him but everytime he shifted or moved a dull ache would shoot through his body and the memory would flood back to him behind his eyelids. --- WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!It wasn’t everyday that you were hung from the ceiling and repeatedly beaten with a bullwhip, but this had been going on for nearly twenty minutes now, Moriarty watching as a henchman connected the whip to Sherlock’s bareback, having Sherlock count. He was up to 23 before Moriarty told the man that, that was enough. A stool was put under Sherlock’s feet to relieve the weight on his shoulders but he was not unchained from the ceiling. Moriarty wandered around to the back of Sherlock and licked at the blood that was dripping from an open wound on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock shivered in disgust and tried to pull away from the warm, wet mouth wandering around on his back. “You taste delicious Sherlock” Sherlock blanched and was thankful that Moriarty was still standing behind him. Moriarty grabbed hold of Sherlock’s bare arse, squeezing it lightly. “I still remember the feel of being inside you Sherlock” Moriarty whispered against Sherlock’s ear. “You were fantastic” Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and swallowed thickly, trying to keep the thoughts at bay. “I wonder what your cum would taste like?” Moriarty said, his voice husky as he bit at Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock kept his eyes squeezed shut, trying to ignore Moriarty but it was hard when he was rubbing at his abdomen and his body was betraying his mind. Sherlock turned his head away from Moriarty and made a small crying noise in the back of his throat when Moriarty wrapped a hand around him. “Would you Sherlock, would you come from this? Could I make you?” Sherlock whimpered and tried to pull away from Moriarty but the firm grip on his neck stopped him from getting very far. “Sherlock don’t tell me you don’t love this” Moriarty said, stroking Sherlock slowly. Sherlock whimpered again and shifted his feet around on the stool. “Sherlock you are truly magnificent, a flawless being” Sherlock tilted his hips in an attempt to get out of Moriarty’s grip but he merely shifted the angle of Moriarty’s grip. “Don’t defy me Sherlock” Moriarty said, tightening his grip. “You’re not getting out of this one” Moriarty moved to the front of Sherlock, Sherlock’s position and height difference making it easy for Moriarty to simply lean down and take the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth. Sherlock gasped, never before had someone ever done something like this to him and he wished the first time had been with someone he cared about. Sherlock groaned and turned his head into the crook of his arm when Moriarty took Sherlock all the way. The sensation was unbelievable and Sherlock wanted to enjoy it, wanted to want it, because it felt incredible, but it was Moriarty’s mouth around him, the same man who three days before had raped him. Moriarty swirled his tongue and Sherlock struggled to keep his hips still, trying not to thrust up into the warm heat of Moriarty’s mouth. Moriarty bobbed his head and hollowed his cheeks and Sherlock gasped. Sherlock knew it wouldn’t take much longer and he tried to pull away from the heat of Moriarty’s mouth, not wanting Moriarty to be the cause of his pleasure. Moriarty grabbed hold of Sherlock’s hips and kept him from moving away. Moriarty hollowed his cheeks and with a few more pulls Sherlock was coming down the back of Moriarty’s throat. --- SAFE! SAFE! SAFE!Sherlock was tired and he just wanted to sleep but no such thing was about to happen as he was currently being tied to a chair. Moriarty flexed his hands, cracking his knuckles. He slipped on his set of brass knuckles over his right hand, wandering over to Sherlock and crouching down in front of him. “Sherlock, I’m going to ask you some questions and if you answer incorrectly,” Moriarty looked down at his hand “well lets just say there’ll be repercussions.” Moriarty stood back up and nodded, indicating that it was fine for his henchmen to leave. Moriarty turned around and stared down at his hand. “Who’s John Watson?” “My friend” Moriarty whipped around and brought his fist down hard against Sherlock’s cheek. “Wrong Sherlock my love, who’s John Watson?” “My friend” Sherlock responded again and again Moriarty’s fist connected with Sherlock’s face, this time his jaw. This went on for a few more rounds, the incorrect answer resulting in Moriarty’s fist connecting with a part of Sherlock’s face. Thick dark blood dripped from Sherlock’s lip and down above his left eyebrow. Moriarty questioned him several more times before Sherlock finally responded in a correct manner. ""Who's John Watson"" Moriarty asked, his grip tight and firm on Sherlock's chin. ""I don't know"" Sherlock responded, his voice breathy and a bit distant. ""I don't know a John Watson"" --- Sherlock cried out as Moriarty etched the letters into the skin near his hip, JIM. ""So you'll always know who you belong to"" Moriarty said, placing heat over the cut, smiling as Sherlock cried out again.",Darkness Rising,12879

John wanted Mycroft to find Sherlock, he wanted Sherlock to be home. It had been four months since John had seen Sherlock and he wished that they hadn’t been fighting right before he was taken, he felt horrible every day that passed, knowing that he’d been upset with something stupid that Sherlock had done but now he was gone and John wasn’t sure if Sherlock would ever be the same again if they ever did find him.A---ASherlock shivered as the lukewarm water washed over his head. Never before has a bath felt better than it did right now, and Moriarty was being so gentle. Moriarty ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair as he poured water over his head, in an attempt to comb out Sherlock’s wild curls.AIt made Sherlock think of his mother, the way she always used to try to get Sherlock to brush his hair, insisting that it was snarly and needed to be brushed, but each time Sherlock would refuse and so on bath night his mother would violently rip through his hair with a comb until the snarls were gone and until his hair was tame.ABut Moriarty was not his mother and Sherlock knew that his caress would be gentle, would be caring and soft. But he knew they were coming from someone who was no such thing. Moriarty pulled too hard on Sherlock’s hair, ripping a small chunk of it out.A“Ow” Sherlock cried, his hand flying up to touch the spot where the hair had been. Moriarty slapped his hand away, brushing his own over the spot and leaning down with gentle lips to kiss the wound.A“I’m sorry” Moriarty said, pressing his forehead into Sherlock’s hair.ASherlock sighed, “I forgive you”A---ASherlock hated it. Hated the feel of Moriarty’s mouth on his skin, hated the way it make him feel, slimy and dirty and used. Sherlock lay flat on his back, in the light room with the high ceilings and comfortable furniture on a king sized bed with soft sheets that smelt of lemon and reminded him of home.AMoriarty was next to him, placing kisses along various bruises, cuts and scars, admiring each one and regaling Sherlock in a tale of how each was acquired as if Sherlock didn’t already know.A“I like this one” Moriarty said, kissing against each tender letter in the rough carving of his name on Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock whimpered, and Moriarty smiled against his skin. “I hope you have fond memories of us whenever you look at it.” Sherlock sighed and turned his head away. Moriarty smiled to himself and continued on with his exploration of Sherlock’s marred body.A---AJohn jiggled his leg up and down, listening in anticipation as Mycroft explained the situation to him.A“So if we bring a team of specially trained people in then we should be able to retrieve Sherlock”A“Okay so how long would this take?” John asked, frowning at Mycroft’s calm expression. Mycroft cringed slightly but regained composure quickly.A“Two weeks at the minimum” John’s eyes grew wide, nearly bulging out of his skull.A“Two weeks? Mycroft it’s been four months, if we wait any longer who knows what he’ll do to Sherlock, who knows what he’s done!” Mycroft sighed.A“I understand John, but it is a very delicate situation we can’t just bust down the door and go crashing about with our heads cut off” John sighed, crossing his arms and falling back into his chair.A“Two weeks though?”A“Possibly more, I’ll do my best”",Darkness Rising,12879

He fell back in almost slow motion, a smile still plastered onto his face. He leaned his head to the side, coming face to face with Sherlock, he smiled wider, the situation seeming so perfect. John frowned slightly when the light no longer lit up Sherlock's features. He sat up, turning around, suddenly finding himself in the morgue at Saint Barts. He frowned, wandering over to the examination table. He gasped at the sight, Sherlock, his face beaten and bloodied, all colour drained out of his features. John could suddenly feel tears pushing at his eyes, he choked back a sob. ""I'm so sorry John"" the cold, distant voice of Mycroft said. John gasped suddenly, flying up in bed. John sat for a moment, breathing heavily. He wiped the sweat off his face and took in the fact that yes indeed he was laying in a pool of his own sweat. He sighed, scrubbing his hands over his face. He threw his legs over the edge of the bed, slowly standing and making his way to the bathroom. He turned the cold water on in the sink, gripping the edge of the sink so hard his knuckles turned white. How'd he manage to fall asleep? He definitely hadn't meant to. He sighed, cupping his hands under the water before splashing it onto his warm face. It did little to calm him. He practiced the breathing exercises his therapist had taught him but it did nothing. Rage suddenly enveloped him and he punched the mirror, cracking the glass and cutting his knuckles, but he didn’t care. He stormed into the kitchen, throwing the cupboard doors open, taking out plates and glasses, throwing them across the room into the living room and listening to them smash against the wall behind Sherlock’s chair. Once he’d smashed all the plates and glasses he let out a frustrated sigh, throwing himself down in his arm chair, letting out a strangled sob. He just wanted Sherlock home. ---Sherlock cried out, blubbering like a small child. “I’m sorry” Sherlock sobbed. “You’re lying!” Moriarty shouted, striking him again across his back with the thick leather belt. Sherlock let out another strangled sob. Moriarty moved around to the front of Sherlock and grabbed his chin, forcing his head up. “You lied to me Sherlock”“I’m sorry, I’m sorry”“Who is John Watson?”“I don’t know, I swear I don’t know” Sherlock said, tears rolling down his cheeks and onto Moriarty’s fingers. “Then why did you speak of him?” Moriarty ground out, fury in his eyes. “I don’t know, I’m sorry, I’m sorry” Moriarty threw his face, storming out of the room. Sherlock lay on his bed, sobbing uncontrollably, he was sorry, he really was. Sorry, sorry sorry, sorry for everything. ---John was forced to go to the shooting range, Mycroft insisted and Mycroft insisted he go with. “What the hell do I need gun training for? I know how to handle a gun.” Mycroft sighed, leaning against the counter. “Because, while you are well versed in gun managment I do believe you need a refresher course and judging by the amount of broken china in your flat and your scabbed knuckles I would guess that you have quite a lot of pent up anger.” John clenched his jaw and balled his hands into fists at his sides. “I’m fine.” John ground out between gritted teeth. “Yes so I understand” Mycroft said, grabbing the targets from the man behind the counter. And heading out to the range, John following close behind him. The buzzer sounded as a go ahead and Mycroft walked out onto the field, placing the targets at 15 meters. When he came back he stood next to John, watching him. John sighed, raising the hand gun up and aiming at the target, squeezing the trigger and hitting the target nearly dead center. John turned back to look at Mycroft, raising an eyebrow. Mycroft kept a stony expression of indifference and motioned for John to continue. John shot the other four bullets, all of them lodging in the target around the same spot. Once John was finished the safety buzzer went off and Mycroft went out and retrieved the target that John had shot at. He and John stared at it closely, Mycroft nodded. “Told you I was fine” John said, walking back inside.  ---They hadn’t made any real progress in getting Sherlock out, not the way that Mycroft had promised. Mycroft had said two weeks but it had been closer to four at this point. Lord only knew what Sherlock was having to deal with. John clenched his fists at his sides, he sighed, leaning back in his arm chair. It wasn’t fair, Mycroft said he would try John knew that Mycroft was a busy man and he knew that he had a lot of responsibilities but to John none of that mattered, all that mattered was getting Sherlock home. John wanted to hit Mycroft, wanted to wipe his smug expression off his face. John had long since reached the point of exhaustion and was simply running off fumes at this point but he dreaded going to sleep for fear of the night terrors. He sighed, heaving himself up and out of his arm chair, heading to the bathroom. He reached into the shower and turned it on, letting the hot steam fill the small bathroom. He gripped the edge of the sink, peering into the cracked, broken mirror, he’d nearly forgotten that he’d broken it. Unwarranted emotion suddenly crept in and John felt hot tears roll down his cheeks and down off his chin. He couldn’t help it, he’d kept everything in for so long, letting himself only feel anger but now it didn’t matter, nothing mattered but Sherlock and Sherlock wasn’t here so it didn’t mattered. John let the tears fall freely, let out a choked sob. God, what was happening? ---Mycroft had explained to John that they were ready to make a move on Moriarty in order to retrieve Sherlock. “I’m going with” John stated firmly. Mycroft let out an exasperated sigh. “How many times must I tell you, this is a delicate situation and we need experts going in.”“I’m not sitting on the sidelines waiting, I’m going with” Mycroft sighed again. “I’ll make arrangements for you” John saw Mycroft out before falling into his arm chair with an exhausted sigh.

The crime rates would rise. NSY would come down crashing around them. World economy would suffer. Anthea wouldn't handle the disaster. John would lose a friend. Sherlock would lose a brother. Mycroft would lose his sanity. All of this, if Greg dared to be stupid enough to pass away.","He fell heavily, against the wall and thought ‘Well, so much for this.’ Lifting a hand from his abdomen to see it covered in red, all went dark before John could reach his side screaming “Sherlock, Greg’s been shot!” his voice sounded as if they were underwater. It resounded deeply and the sirens were so far from them.Sherlock’s hurried steps ran past them as he screamed something in a fury. Last thing he felt was a sharp pain over his lower belly.-“It can’t be so bad, Greg” said his mum, softly caressing his head “My brave boy. You’re so tenacious, my love. You’ll get through this.”His brown eyes met their equal and he sighed, looking up into his mother’s face “Hello, mum.” It felt as though they had never parted, “I’m bloody tired.”She fretted and said “Watch your mouth, young boy. You’re not keeping that language when you’re talking near me.”Greg chuckled and got up, pain had finally left him. His back felt as if it was in one piece even if he had stayed up all night, his headache had eased away and his abdomen was anew. The light in his childhood’s home living room was dim, but he could see his mum’s pale features clashing with her salt and pepper hair and bright smirk, that reached her eyes. He smiled back and saw her eyes were watering “Oh, my love. I wanted to hold you so much” she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him into a hug.“Christ, mum. One might say you haven’t seen me in your life.” He chuckled and held her back “Where’s Trish?” he asked, looking around for his younger sister.Lauren sniffled and got up to walk to the kitchen; Greg followed “She’s at her home, taking care of her family. I hear she got a promotion at her job, she works too hard. I know her husband makes sure she rests and takes care of herself, but could you keep an eye on her as well?” the old woman busied herself making tea.In the ceiling he found the stickers his sister and himself used to put up there so their mum didn’t clean them away, he found an old Snoopy character smiling and dancing down at him and he smiled back “I thought that this place was in the demolition plan of 96’. Trish and I tried to keep it up…” he couldn’t remember if they had managed or not, but the fact that he was back home was proof enough for now.She sighed and looked up “I always loved looking at those… Your father would’ve let you keep them so I just did, you kids thought you were so sneaky, too!” her glassy dark eyes looked up at his with glee and she placed a hand on his, “Oh, Greg, you would’ve had such beautiful children.” She caressed the back of her son’s head and placed her head on his shoulder like she did when he was eighteen and struggling between a job and uni, holding him close as if he was going to break under the pressure.‘There we go’ he thought, refraining from rolling his eyes “What a coincidence. I always thought you’d have beautiful children, and you did!”Smiling in spite of her, she patted his arm, chiding him “Oh, Greg.” The man in question looked at her still smirking merrily and she said “I never liked that woman, it was a matter of time until she mucked up…” laying her hip on the rim of the counter, Lauren sipped from her mug, doing her best to calm her nerves. It was true that she had never been fond of Greg’s now ex-wife and she seemed to suffer through their wedding and first years of marriage instead of enjoying them with him. She thought she kept the looks of foreboding to herself, but Greg witnessed her grief on occasion. Still her features returned from bitterness into her usual playfulness “But I’m very fond of that man you fancy these days.”Greg blinked and frowned, losing his smile slowly “What man, mum?” he asked curiously.She took her mug and said “Oh, you know, the posh rupert. The one with that brother that gets you in trouble. Bit of a toff, but he’s always taken good care of you even if you haven’t even properly dated him. I can feel his worry all the way from here, I swear, my goodness.” She shook her head, quietly commenting on the man’s best treats.It all left Greg gaping slightly ‘How do you know Mycroft?’, ‘Why do you think he’s worried?’, instead of overloading her with pointless questions, he took his own mug from the counter and took a sip of the rich coffee with cinnamon.Lauren had been a nurse, so she was used to strong drinks just as her son and daughter, she had been a single mother of two after losing her husband and soldiered on through trials and tribulations that life put in her way, dealing with them in style. And for being that cool mum his friends envied, that protective parent they needed and that reassuring smile after a bad day, Greg admired her.And, as always, mum knew best, Greg snorted “I'm not sure you know him enough, mum. He's not the kind to go after my types... We do make a good team on some aspects, but that's about it.” he looked into his mug as the cinnamon danced and let out puffs of delicious smell.“Oh, Greg, you’re still as handsome and charming as you were when you were sixteen years-old, love. You just have to show him a bit of that Lestrade charm. It definitely worked on me when your father used it.” She looked at the window reminiscing of those good old days, when his father was still his scintillating self, before illness took over.Feeling a bit dejected over the stale and grim subjects surrounding him he said “Mum, I'm not dating Mycroft Holmes, nobody is ever dating him, in fact.” snorted out a laugh, as if the idea itself was absolutely ridiculous and took another sip of his coffee. One thing was distant esteem and appreciation, another was to just come out and ask him to date.She sighed dramatically, making Greg turn and look at her as she placed a hand on her chin “Oh, dear me, here I was waiting for an eternity until my son finally found someone worthy, allowed himself fall in love at last. And once he does-”That alone was enough to make Greg choke on the beverage, the man coughed and felt his mother giggling and patting his back “Woah” he coughed a bit more, feeling his eyes tear up “Ah, Christ, mum! In love? Are you mad?” he laughed heartily “I look at the bloke, he's handsome. That’s all.” Lauren's eyes twinkled as she smiled at him and needless to say what she was thinking “Not even joking, mum.“ his tone was firm, but there was something in his eyes betraying his words and his mother saw through it.“Oh, you've done much worse.” she said looking down at her mug innocently and savoring the wince that came in response at her next phrase “Remember Kevin?”The Detective Inspector groaned loudly and covered his eyes feeling a blush rise “Dear God, I thought we promised to never speak of that again. ”Kevin had clearly been a one-time mistake that for some reason had an extended visa and stayed around for almost three months.Mrs. Lestrade hummed and placed her mug on her lips, downing her coffee and turning to leave her mug on the sink “Mycroft is so much better than any of your previous partners. I just don't want to see you going home and being on your own, love.”“I’m fine on my own, mum” he didn’t dare looking up from his shoes. And felt incredibly sad for a second, as if this conversation was something they owed each other for a long time. As if their time together was like sand escaping between their fingers.“I always regretted letting you see my grief.” The woman sighed softly, looking at the window again “You were so young and I couldn’t bring myself to stop mourning your father… But it doesn’t mean that love always hurts and ends up tragically. Most might not know why you just let go of your marriage amicably… It’s never too late to believe in love, Greg…” she took his chin between index and thumb, turning his face towards her “And it’s not bad remembering your father or me, love. It’s not wrong to feel bad and no matter what, you have your sister with you… Even at distance.”Dedicating her a sad, broken smile he desperately attempted to cover up with void humor “Mum, can you imagine what hell my life would turn into if I dated James Bond? Multiply it for a hundred and toss fits on how my socks are on the floor at it. That would be my life with Mycroft as a boyfriend.” said Greg, vaguely amused at the scene where Mycroft would be terribly annoyed at his disorderly behavior. How adorable it would be to see him cleaning the dishes as Greg cooks and putting the bed together in the mornings.How he'd complain about his torn and battered field suits. How it probably wouldn't matter much if in this world Mycroft wanted him the way he is. Socks, suits, cuddling in late mornings, snoozing the alarm for five more minutes and football on Sunday afternoons.Lauren's voice broke the fantasy as she followed his joke, making a tear escape from the corner of his eye “May I remind you that Mr. Bond is one sassy partner and a devilish master seducer, love” she wiggled her eyebrows, just as Greg looked down chasing the tears away and he laughed heartily. Still, for some reason, the loving, stubborn woman was breaking his heart.“Now that's a funny thought, can’t see a serious bloke like that in a yacht, surrounded by gorgeous women” he stated with a wide smile “But cheers on your creativity” he lifted his mug and lightly touched hers as he left it in the sink beside hers. Both cups colorful, close and still warm from the beverages. For some reason Greg couldn’t stop looking, feeling that he was living in a rather elaborate déjà vu.“Oh, love. I've seen the way he daydreams of you, the way he looks after you. It's more than you'd think, you know better than being assuming people are a certain way, don't you, son?” she said looking up and suddenly the light started coming through the windows. Greg looked up at it and Lauren covered his eyes, pulling him away from it “Come on, love. You have to lay down.” the woman pulled Greg urgently and the door slammed open.His father, eyes clear blue and dark hair came in “Take him to the living room.”A breath he didn't know he was holding escaped him and he managed to say 'Wha-?' when the entire house shook and the mugs dropped to the ground as the sink disappeared leaving a hole in its place.It all came back to him violently, making him screw his eyes shut. He remembered the men that were trying to run off with a mesopotamian reliquary valued in no more than five million pounds. They had turned and the shot resounded, hitting him before he could duck and cover.Greg screamed in pain, looking down at his abdomen, seeing blood seep out of him in a river and pressing a hand to make it stop “Pain is good, Greg.” Said Mr. Lestrade’s voice “You have to go back.” He said patting his shoulder and Greg couldn’t look up at his face.“Be careful when you're there, we love you” was all Lauren managed in a distant murmur.The house fell down around them. Crashing sounds and he felt dread as if they were still alive. How could he forget of lying beside his father on the hospital bed as he was slowly consumed by his illness? How could he forget of his mum’s features when she recovered from that first heart attack? Now he worried about them dying again. And when Greg started wondering if he was dead himself, his father said “He'll recover, Mr. Holmes.” into the vast void it left behind their family home.That was the last he knew of that mad dream.-The light was blinding and he felt too sore to exist, he took a few deep breaths and felt his throat closed by tubes. Panicking slightly, wondering what was the unfamiliar feeling he felt a cool hand on his forehead and focusing on that, slowly calming as a deep voice spoke in a language he couldn’t possibly comprehend, he sighed and fell back into a deep sleep that lasted a blink. At least for him, he briefly went to a quiet place where he lost absolute consciousness. And just like that, Greg's world was white nothingness.Only a few moments later, he opened his eyes slowly. Blurry images from the outside world started getting to him as he quietly looked ahead and around. Deciding to close them again and rest for a bit.He tried to move his fingers and didn’t find the strength to do it. His brain kicked up a few gears and his first thoughts came to Greg, 'Think of The Bride. Start with the fingers.' he thought and it was bloody impossible 'Damn you, Tarantino. You sodding liar.' he cursed inwardly and opened his eyes, his sight still completely hazy.It started adjusting slowly, the more he insisted in looking at the shadows around him. He managed to identify John fast asleep on a sofa under the window and Sherlock sitting, legs crossed on a chair next to him, his face reflecting the light from his phone as he rapidly passed through pages.'Must be the evening', he thought looking at the window and the clouded, darkened skies outside.“Boss!” someone whispered urgently and it made Greg wince, feeling his raspy throat through a grunt. Slowly turning to his left, he saw Mycroft getting up from a hospital chair next to the bed and pressing a button. He looked as pristine and untouchable as ever as he checked on him, pale eyes looking down into his, even if his pressed shirt had its sleeves rolled up to the man’s elbows and he didn’t have his jacket on.“Welcome back, Mr. Lestrade”, he said looking unfazed “The nurse should be on her way. Bring water, Anthea.” He ordered softly.The heels clicked away as he blinked groggily and groaned slightly trying to move, he felt the ghost of a touch on his chest as Mycroft rearranged the covers and pushed him down, “You deserved to die, if I’m honest.” Said Sherlock from his chair, glaring at his phone’s screen as John sighed and sat up rubbing his eyes as he said ‘Sherlock’ warning him to stop being a prick as he always did and Greg tried to speak, but then decided to opt for flipping the diplomatic middle finger at him.John giggled and commented “Can’t believe you have the strength to argue, mate.” Sherlock simply shot a strange look at him, between resentful and amused.Soon enough, Anthea came back with a straw and a bottle of water, as well as a nurse that started revising him ‘Ever so efficient this girl’, he thought. The woman placed the straw between his lips and he took small sips and closed his eyes as the soreness in his throat started waning to a dull sting.The needles started coming out of his arm and the girl said, “You’re a lucky one, Mr. Lestrade. Got away with this one.”Sighing he swallowed in bliss and opened his eyes lazily once more, turning to look at the nurse, “Define lucky.” He said, pressing a hand to his face as he heard his voice come out as weak as he felt, and Mycroft let out a quiet sigh of relief. Then frowned at him and looked at the small nurse, standing to his full height, sporting his best I-could-have-you-fired-deported-and-killed attitude, “State?” he asked briskly.“Alive and drifting, you?” he answered as quickly as he could, smiling weakly at the civil servant. Far from amused, the rust haired man pursed his lips, a tad disquiet and the woman giggled lightly as she checked the needles and equipment.The woman smiled and looked around at the people staring at her avidly as she walked around the policeman’s bed, “The doctor will be here in a few moments and you can ask him personally, yeah?”Sherlock opened his mouth glaring at the nurse and at unison Greg and John said ‘Put a sock in it, Sherlock’ and ‘Don’t you dare, Sherlock’ making him snap his mouth shut and mumble angrily through his teeth. Mycroft’s jaw was set, but it was obvious he would also eat her alive if he had the chance. ‘The Holmes brothers for you’, thought Greg pinching the bridge of his nose, trying to hold back the dizziness.Pursing her lips, the nurse retreated to the door, moving carefully around a trained soldier, two MI6 agents and a mad genius. Not looking at them as she spoke, “Don’t you worry, everything looks normal so far and he might feel a bit tired because of the residual effect of the cocktail we gave him.” She dedicated Greg a reassuring smile “You’ll be fine.” He gave her a small smirk and she beamed slightly, before disappearing out the door.He glared at Sherlock as he winced trying to move a pillow around, but Mycroft was there again. Pulling it out and placing it under his head, “It appears everything’s normal in her observations. They didn’t get you off the morphine, so you’ll still have a fun ride for a few days. But I’m sure your doctor will recommend you to stay for further observations. Perhaps a day or two.” Said John looking at the chart at the foot of his bed and moving around the bed to check the I.V.Meanwhile Mycroft looked at Sherlock, the taller man looked at him with the same intensity. They both turned to him and Greg barely managed to look from one to another, before they returned to look at each other, Mycroft changed his weight from one foot to the other and Sherlock looked at the floor grumbling and nodding.“Well, at least I get to keep the drugs. If you manage to smuggle coffee in, I can definitely cope with this.” Greg joked lightly, clearing his throat.“You do not deserve any treats,” Sherlock sniffled angrily, “Not after that ghastly behavior. Even Mycroft ran to see you.”The man in question scoffed, “Of course I would, Sherlock, considering he’s the only reason you haven’t found an early death. Imagine that you would be left under my tutelage if he were to perish, neither of us wishes that, do we?” Sherlock grimaced in disgust in response “And if we are to point fingers, Inspector Lestrade should know you spent an evening in jail after beating the man who shot him to near death.” The man sat again with a small, devious smirk dedicated at his fuming younger brother.Sherlock glared viciously, “Don’t you have an important meeting to attend to, or someplace else to haunt? I’m sure Babylon-on-Thames must be having a ball over your sudden absence. Shouldn’t you hurry and ruin someone else’s day with your somber presence?” Mycroft stayed pointedly put as he sighed tiredly muttering ‘Juvenile of you, Sherlock.’“Well, isn’t it nice to be back?” asked John with a terminal tone, warning behind his humorous question.The DI started feeling more like himself and hummed trying to pacify the atmosphere “By the way, how long was it?”The older Holmes brother rolled his eyes and passed a pile of documents to his PA “Thank you, dear. You were convalescing for three days now, Inspector, and I recommend that you keep quiet and sleep if you wish a soon recovery.” He sighed as his phone started ringing loudly; he picked up speaking in Spanish.Anthea pushed a strand of jet black hair away from her face “Will that be all, sir?” She asked giving her boss a hard look as he took an extra second to nod, before he briefly excused himself out.She turned to Greg with a warmer smile upon her cool features and said “You look in fine form, sir. I hope you recover soon.”Snorting out a soft chuckle “So these two don’t drive you mad?” he asked.“Well, since you put it that way…” commented John while Sherlock huffed at the noise and frantically typed on his phone.“And for your own sake, I’m not sure I want to see them as worried as they were again.” The stoic agent looked at the Holmes left in the room.“That bad, then?” he asked casually, dreading the answer.The young woman looked down and John sighed before saying “You were dead for two full minutes and there were dire warnings of you returning in a different form due to the blood loss… I would say it was quite bad, mate. You’ll have to take it easy for a month or two.”Exhaling and closing his eyes, he just whispered “Damn.”“Rest, Greg.” Insisted the woman, eyes returning to her phone and looking up at him one last time, placing her warm hand on his “I’ll see you later, sir.” And with a small, enigmatic smile she walked to the door, hands still full of important looking documents.He turned to see Mycroft leave way for her to exit as he reentered the room and sat back on the chair “I have arranged things so your doctor and surgeon may see you first as soon as they start their rounds.”Letting out a long, suffering sigh, the wounded man shifted slightly feeling his stitches itch and sting, “Come on, you said it. I’m convalescing, give me a bloody break. I don’t want to see more doctors.” John rolled his eyes.“You shouldn’t have put yourself in such a dangerous position if you didn’t wish for this sort of attention. Think of this moment the next time…” chided Mycroft in his usual light tones as he focused on another stack of papers laying on his lap, poised and immovable from his side, deep apprehension worrying his brow.“I have to give it to him. That happens to be the most idiotic thing I have ever witnessed him do.” Sherlock commented quietly, eyes still fixed on his phone, “And I work with him on weekly basis.”“Oh, sod off, I don’t have to remind you of the stupid situations I’ve had to get you out of,” said Greg trying to cross his arms over his chest, but desisting upon the pain it caused. He placed his hands on his stomach and said “Can you stop updating your twitter when you insult me at least? Who are you harassing?” he asked looking at Sherlock’s fingers fly over the touch screen.The Consulting Detective gave him a dirty look and he heard Mycroft let out a breath of laughter.“Translation:” John stated loudly “You worried us quite a lot, mate. We’re very glad you’re alright.” He said looking at him with a small smile.“Heartwarming, really” The silver haired man shook his head lightly and reached for the water bottle, Mycroft reached it before he did and handed it out “Ta.”“Regardless of my experiences, the fact remains that you ran after an armed suspect and did not wait for the armed party in the group. You are an absolute idiot and I am here simply to tell you that in person.” Sherlock upturned the lapels of his belstaff.The more the young man spoke, ever so posh, tall and dramatic, the more Greg wanted to hug him and punch him “You little spod. See if you can get cases from me after this.”John placed his hands up with a slightly panicked look and said “Leave it there, boys. You don’t want the soldier with PTSD to go crazy.”The Consulting Detective snorted, “He doesn’t mean it, john. I will never need to worry that you lose your peasant sense of humor, at least.”“Not a chance, love.” He smiled at the drama-queen, the man’s eyes returned to the screen and he took long strides to the door leaving swiftly, “If you’ll be going to come back, bring me doughnuts to pass the visit!” he screamed after, and John chuckled.“You do not deserve treats!” was all Sherlock screamed back.Greg moaned “Oh, come on! It’s vital for my recovery!” there came no answer and he settled down with a small smile.“He’s probably going to the morgue,” he explained and sighed “Sorry, about that. Promise not to bring him back until you’ve recovered a bit more energy.”Greg’s eyes turned to Mycroft briefly and he saw the man reading a stack of papers sitting on his lap. He looked as if he had been working from that spot the entire afternoon, “Sure, at least they didn’t start the Third World War in here.” Mycroft sighed and continued to read, ignoring them completely.“How are you feeling? More importantly, what were you thinking?” asked John deep blue eyes trained on him with clinical worry, he could feel a similar set burning holes on the back of his head for a few moments, until they eased away.Greg sighed tiredly, feeling sleep starting to claim him slowly, “I’m feeling surprisingly great, must be the drugs.” He clearly avoided the subject on what he was thinking entirely. At the moment he thought that he could close their path from the other side and the Consulting Detective could get to them the parallel street once they exited the alley. Of course he didn’t count on them holding a gun.The blonde snorted as he searched for his wallet in “Well, then you won’t mind to hear Arsenal lost the classic match last Sunday.”“Well, don’t you know how to improve a man’s day…” grumbling through the drowsiness that settled once again.He heard John’s laugh “See why rugby’s my treat? Just follow your doctors’ instructions and you’ll be up on your feet before you know it-” his phone was suddenly swarmed by texts and as he looked, he smiled fondly “That’s my cue out. Plenty of rest and water.”“I certainly won’t be having trouble in following your orders, Doctor Watson.” He sighed and opened his eyes again, taking John’s hand in a firm shake, “I could probably sleep for the rest of the year.”“We’ll come ‘round when Sherlock’s calmer, yeah?” the doctor put his jacket on and walked to the exit, “Mycroft.” He saluted cordially and walked away as the older Holmes nodded back at him.The room fell silent and Greg sighed tiredly, Mycroft shifted in his seat and pulled out his phone typing on it, slowly and frowning. Greg smiled a bit to himself, it was somewhat funny that the most powerful man in the world was far too lazy to manage a few texts. The replies came through quickly and the man sighed before placing the device on his breast pocket, before looking up at the amused DI, “Apologies. I was wondering if I should leave and let you rest now. I’m unsure if you’d prefer for me to stay until the doctor in charge is able to see you.” He asked looking down at his feet tiredly.Mycroft’s posture spoke of ever present confidence and alertness, but he was dressed down and the way he took deep, slow breaths spoke of exhaustion and long days. The man looked similar to the way in which he found him that first time. Sitting quietly beside Sherlock, head in one hand and the other over his brother’s own.Blinking slowly feeling as if he’d faint under a blanket of deep sleep, he chuckled and closed his eyes letting the smirk stay at the corners of his lips “Relax, Holmes. I can take care of myself from now on, yeah? Plus I don’t think I’m on my A-game to antagonize you more than this. If you’d like to take your leave, it’s fine.” Greg’s voice slowly relaxed into the caress of morphine.The other man hummed lowly, staring at the side of his face, “Very well. At least I know you will be in the best of hands, your sister’s been picked up from the airport and it’s on her way over either way. You will have to forgive me, but I preferred to make sure you would be able to receive them. Hence I waited until you woke up.”Swallowing as his brother mentioned Patricia coming to see him, he groaned lightly and kept quiet for a few moments. So much for his much needed peace “’s fine. One way or another I won’t hear the end of it, now I can blame the tardy news on you at least.” He opened his eyes slightly and saw a small smirk form on Mycroft’s eyes, as he steeped his hands over his thin lips.“I shan’t be able to visit you any longer if you do, not if your sister is around.” He commented sitting back, letting the smile reach his lips.The DI chuckled and closed his eyes comfortably again “Definitely not.” An idea came to him and he said “Alright, I’ll take the blame if you bring me biscuits.” He offered looking at Mycroft as he stood up and straightened his sleeves, pulling the cufflinks from his pockets.“I will not be easier to convince than my brother, you require a diet until you have fully recovered.” He said wearing a fond smile upon his features as his pale eyes looked for his jacket, he put his pocket watch in his waistcoat’s pocket, elegantly crossing the chain.The DI’s eyes followed the movements, mesmerized in the precision “I’m somewhere between moved and creeped out that you even know I’ll have to follow a diet. Have you revised my PHR?” he managed to comment, shaking his head as a mad thought that begged him to place a hand over Mycroft’s waistcoat and chain.He heard him hum through as he fought to keep his eyes open and watch Mycroft take his leave “I don’t need to bother to know how to recover from these type of wounds, Inspector” he swallowed thickly and thought ‘Blimey, if that isn’t a tad sexy.’ Mycroft’s shuffles came closer for a moment and Greg’s fingers twitched, too tired to hold onto the man like he wanted “Do not make us go through that again.” He said quietly and close ‘Damn, I can’t open my eyes.’“I’ll certainly endeavor not to repeat it.” He managed to move his head back to the center of the pillow and smiled, mocking “Shame, though, seeing as I’ve enjoyed it so much.”A chuckle left the other man “That is the Detective Inspector we were expecting to recover in all his sarcastic glory. A pleasure to have you back, Mr. Lestrade.”Sighing he mumbled “’m sure it is.” And he stopped fighting sleep as a cool, steady hand returned to caress his forehead. Softly brushing away whatever thought remained and leading him into unconsciousness, easing away the pain and grief, reassuring the tired policeman. The simple action muttered the words Greg couldn't possibly listen.",Unfortunate incident.,5312

He really, really hopes John will want to see him – and it all ends up going a little bit differently than in the series.","A“And what about John Watson?” Sherlock asked his brother, while he straightened the collar of his snow white shirt. He had been back in England only hours, but he had managed to postpone the topic of John Watson until now.Anthea glanced at Mycroft as if they had discussed this point beforehand. Sherlock couldn’t help but hypothesise: see, they had talked about him and John. Well, it was to be expected – Mycroft could be quite sharp in his observations sometimes, as much as Sherlock hated to admit it. He wouldn’t be surprised if Mycroft had noticed Sherlock’s eagerness to contact John, or even foreseen it. Maybe he had even warned John that Sherlock was returning.“John?” Mycroft asked, in a clear attempt to buy himself some time.Sherlock hummed in agreement. “Have you seen him?” He was genuinely curious. He wouldn’t have put it past Mycroft to have actually kept in touch with John – not out of sentiment, obviously, but to keep him safe, or simply out of habit. Or indeed because even a man like Mycroft could get lonely sometimes, and Sherlock was sure that Anthea’s company wouldn’t always be enough. She was bright, but by far not as bright as John.Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Oh, yes,” he said mockingly, “we meet up every Friday for fish and chips.”Right. Mycroft also hadn’t had the nerve to face John, then, after Sherlock had disappeared. Sherlock grabbed the folder Anthea held out to him.“I’ve kept a weather eye on him, of course,” Mycroft continued. “You haven’t been in touch at all, to prepare him?”“No,” Sherlock answered quickly. Obviously not. He had wanted to keep John safe. He wouldn’t have risked throwing away everything he had fought for, these past two years.A couple of pictures greeted Sherlock when he opened the file. Dear God. A ghastly moustache. “Well, we’ll have to get rid of that,” he said mostly to himself. In his mind’s eye, he had already played out the future so many times: this time around, he would not miss the chance to charm John, he would make sure that neither of them would leave, he would finally make a move and never let go.In that future, John didn’t have a ridiculous sand-coloured bristle above his mouth, though.“We?” Mycroft asked. Sure, brother, pretend to play innocent.“He looks ancient,” Sherlock said. “I can’t be seen to be wandering around with an old man.”“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft smiled his fake endearing smile that he also displayed to mummy when she said something ludicrous.Sherlock looked up at Mycroft. “What?”“I commend you for keeping the dream alive.”Sherlock nodded absent-mindedly. Finally, after two years, he was going to see John again. It felt like a momentous occasion and he wasn’t quite sure how to face it.A number of scenarios were already running through his head. Creep up behind him and put his hands over John’s eyes. Maybe he could make a nice dinner, have it ready at Baker Street when John would come home. Or he could place himself in John’s bed tonight. Risky, but possibly worth it.Quite unexpectedly, Sherlock felt the urge to do something whimsical, something that would make John laugh. Equally unexpectedly, he felt nervous.“I think I’ll surprise John,” he said, and then adding, “he’ll be delighted,” mostly to assure himself. God, he really, really hoped John would indeed be delighted.“You think so?” Mycroft asked.Sherlock nodded. “I’ll pop into Baker Street. Who knows, jump out of a cake.” Before he had left, it had been clear that John had feelings for him – but now, two years later? Surely he still would. John couldn’t have moved on. He wouldn’t have.“He won’t be home tonight, brother dear.”Hm, that would rule out a nude surprise in the Baker Street living room. Well, of course Sherlock could position himself there and wait all evening for John to come home, but he was getting impatient. “Where’s he going to be tonight?”“How would I know?” Mycroft asked.“You always know.” A little flattery never hurt anyone, after all.“He has a dinner reservation in the Marylebone Road. Nice little spot. They have a few bottles of the 2000 Saint-Emilion. Though I prefer the 2001.”Sherlock chose to ignore Mycroft’s pretentious comment, by virtue of a number of new ideas that entered his mind. The Landmark, then. A fancy restaurant. A good place for a dazzling revelation. “I think maybe I’ll just drop by.” They could jump right into a romantic date. A first date. Finally.“Just be aware that he isn’t expecting you.”Sherlock smiled. “All the more occasion to surprise him.”Only a few hours later, shaved and bathed and well-prepared, Sherlock found himself entering The Landmark. He was quite sure – well, almost sure – that John would welcome him back with open arms. Not a day had gone by in the past two years that Sherlock hadn’t thought of John. John had obviously had feelings for him, that had been clear from day one, and so it was quite inevitable that John would still be waiting for him.And this time around, Sherlock wouldn’t waste any time. He would do what he should have done when they had first met. He wouldn’t be too nervous and closeted and anxious to respond properly to John’s flirtations. He wouldn’t dismiss John’s questions about his love life. He would charm the pants off of him – quite literally, even.The sight of John at his dinner table almost knocked the breath out of Sherlock, if it hadn’t been for the grisly grub of coarse hair decorating his face. (God, the man had really let himself go, hadn’t he.) But apart from the moustache, it was still John in all his glory, he was still the magnificent bundle of brilliance and muscle that Sherlock had missed so dreadfully.A tad greyer, perhaps, and the grief hadn’t been kind to the lines around his eyes. But yes, his eyes were still bright blue, he still had the soft smile, the compact frame, now wrapped in a nice suit (moderately priced, no special occasion, just something he had in his closet), all the same as two years ago. Two years that Sherlock had spent dreaming about this moment.Now, for the surprise. From all the scenarios Sherlock had thought of, he hadn’t been able to pick one. He had spent the past few hours mostly pacing around his brother’s house, more anxious than he’d been willing to admit to himself.When a young female waiter passed him, he decided on a whim to surprise John with a quickly assembled French waiter’s disguise. Making his way over to John’s table, he collected the necessary elements, and even found a way to draw a moustache on his face – John would surely appreciate the joke.When Sherlock arrived at the table, he put on his best French accent and a silly voice. “Can I help you with anything, sir?” The evenings they had spent watching ‘Allo, ‘allo! had certainly paid off, and he was sure John would recognise him.But no. John didn’t look around. He seemed preoccupied with something. “Hi, yeah. I’m looking for a bottle of wine, a good one.”Oh, John’s voice. Sherlock had missed it. He had dialed John’s number sometimes, to hear his voicemail, or even to wait until John picked up – though he had never spoken back.Sherlock leaned closer, to pick up John’s smell. It was just as it used to be. Same toothpaste, same shampoo, same soap. John was a man of habit and Sherlock loved him for it.There, yes: loved. He loved John. Sherlock hadn’t wanted to let himself admit it, but he was so close now, finally. He pushed away the impulse to lower his head only a few inches more to press a soft kiss on John’s neck. No, he would play along and let John discover him.“Well,” he said, “these are all excellent vintages.”“Er, it’s not really my area,” John said. Sherlock’s heart jumped at the memory of himself saying exactly that on their first date. No, he shouldn’t say date. Their first dinner together. They would finally have their first date tonight. “What do you suggest?” John asked.“Well, you cannot possibly go wrong, but if you’d like my personal recommendation, this last one on the list is a favourite of mine.” He pointed to the 2000 Saint-Emilion that his brother had recommended. “It is, you might in fact say–” Sherlock straightened up for the reveal, “–like a face from the past.” With a flourish, he removed his glasses. Come on, John. Look up.But John stayed focused on the menu. “Great. I’ll have that one, please,” he said, taking a large sip from his glass.Well. Alright then. Another try perhaps? “It is familiar, but with the quality of–” this one John surely couldn’t miss, “–surprise!”“Well, surprise me,” John said dismissively.Sherlock was getting a bit frustrated now. “Certainly endeavouring to, sir,” he mumbled, stalking away.He wasn’t quite sure what to do exactly. To buy himself time, he walked to the bar area to fetch the wine. That would be nice, they could have a drink, exchange stories from the past two years, which had no doubt been equally hellish for them both, albeit in different ways. Sure, Sherlock was the one who had been chased and beaten and tortured, but he was aware that John had had to live with the idea of his best friend being dead for two years.A sudden realisation struck him. John wasn’t here alone. The chair opposite him had been pulled back, the napkin unfolded, a glass filled and half-emptied.Mycroft hadn’t been kidding when he said that John wasn’t expecting him. Oh, God. Sherlock really, really hoped it wasn’t a date he was intruding on.Well, what if it was? Sherlock was quite sure that John had been mourning for him as if for a dead spouse. And wouldn’t one’s deepest desire then be to see that person again? Sherlock decided not to be discouraged by the possibility of John dating someone else. After all, how serious could it be?Sherlock quickly calculated: John had surely spent a few months grieving before he would have wanted to start dating, and knowing him, it would have taken him quite a few tries to find the right person. The suit he was wearing: not the sort of thing John would wear to a first date. The restaurant: not a place for a first date, unless John had suddenly started to make significantly more money than he used to, which was highly unlikely, considering the quality of the suit. If it was a date, it would be with someone he’d been together with for a while.Unlikely, then.When Sherlock had just gathered up the courage to walk up to John again, he saw DI Lestrade approach the table from another angle, pulling back the chair opposite John to sit down. What was his name again? George? Gerard. No. Gregor? Greg! Yes, Greg. Hadn’t changed a bit. Sherlock felt a sudden surge of gratitude for Greg’s tolerance of him, all those years. Strange, how two years away could make one look at people quite differently.Not a date, then, surely. Or was it? Sherlock’s mind raced. He couldn’t rule out the possibility. Two years could be long enough for John to (finally) accept the fact that he was attracted to men, and to find a partner. Was that what the moustache was about? Was it the latest fad in the gay community to have a bristly length of hair along the upper lip? Sherlock fell back a bit, observing the situation before he would make a move.“Sorry that took so long, mate,” Greg said, scooting his chair a bit closer to the table. He looked sharply at John, narrowing his eyes. “You okay?”“Yeah, yeah. Me? Fine. I am fine.” John didn’t sound fine.“So he hasn’t come up to you then?”“What?” John looked confused. “Who?”Greg inhaled sharply. “Oh… No one. Nothing. I shouldn’t have said.” He shook his head slightly. “Anyway, I’m glad we’re getting the chance to celebrate my promotion to Chief Inspector. Wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for you, mate.”“You’re welcome.” John smiled. “I’d toast you, but I’m afraid I only just ordered a new bottle, should be here any minute.” He looked around.Sherlock inhaled deeply. It would have to be now.It would have to be now.He hoped, hoped, that this wasn’t a date, that John wouldn’t be angry, that he wouldn’t look him in the face and shout at him, that he wouldn’t punch him in the nose. Sherlock pushed away all of those thoughts, all of those nightmare scenarios.As in a dream, he walked up to the table, gripping the wine bottle with both hands to avoid dropping it. His hands were sweating.In a fit of nerves, he assumed the French waiter persona again. “Sir, I think you will find this vintage exceptionally to your liking,” Greg was looking up at him now, smiling – had he been aware of the plan? – but John was still staring at the table, “it has all the qualities of the old, with some of the colour of the new,” oh God, why was he babbling, “like a gaze from a crowd of strangers,” please, John, look up, “suddenly one is aware of staring into the face of an old friend.”Sherlock took off his glasses with a flourish.John looked up. As his eyes locked onto Sherlock’s, his face fell.Sherlock felt like he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t work out John’s expression. He didn’t look happy. Fear? Anger? Surprise? Sorrow? All of those?The silence was unbearable.“Interesting thing, a tuxedo,” Sherlock broke the silence. “Lends distinction to friends, and anonymity to waiters.” Please, John. Please.John looked at Greg, who shrugged. So he had been in on the plan, then. John’s head did a small shake, or maybe more a tremor, and he got up from his chair inelegantly, rattling the cutlery on the table. He inhaled and looked at Sherlock, then away, then at Sherlock again, as if he wanted to calibrate his vision with other objects in the room that decidedly were real.“Well,” Sherlock continued, “short version… Not dead.” John’s gaze made him feel like he should explain himself.John was still silent.Oh, bollocks. Maybe everything was ruined now. Sherlock felt like he should try to apologise. “Bit mean, springing it on you like that, I know. Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will. But in my defence, it was very funny.” He tried to force his face into a smile.Now, finally, John’s eyes softened. The anger disappeared, the lines on his face instead drawing into sadness, relief, a hint of happiness. One of the corners of his mouth drew up an infinitely small amount, the tiniest fraction of that lopsided smile that had always made Sherlock weak in the knees.John cleared his throat. “Greg,” he asked, “you were in on this, weren’t you?”“Sorry, mate,” Greg’s voice sounded from the other side of the table. “Should have warned you, maybe.” Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to take his eyes away from John’s face.“That’s alright,” John said. “You already expected to go home early, then? I…” He hesitated. “I think I’ve got some catching up to do.”Now, Sherlock’s face plied itself into a genuine smile, a smile he couldn’t suppress, and John’s face was doing the same, and Sherlock felt like he could breathe again, coming back from his paralysis of fear.Sherlock was suddenly conscious of John’s body so close to his, and all the years of longing folded itself into this one moment where he couldn’t stop himself, and before his mind caught up with him, he had taken a step towards John, and his hand had reached out and taken John’s hand.Oh God. They were actually touching. John’s skin was softer than Sherlock had imagined.John stared at their joined hands, as if he was still figuring out whether Sherlock was real.And then Sherlock couldn’t bear it anymore, and he made that last step towards John, and put his free hand on John’s cheek, lifting his head up to look in his eyes.“Is this okay?” he mumbled.John stammered “Oh, God, yes,” before closing the distance between him.The moustache would have to go, though.",A Landmark of happy returns,2768

Better than young Mr Daltrey here at any rate.”“Clearly.”Sherlock eyes darted to Mr Daltrey’s head, which was sitting on a separate table from the body. It had been severed in the car crash that brought the man to the morgue; there was still an arm unaccounted for; Sherlock made a mental note to go looking for it later. To return it to the body, not for science; John would have opinions about that, so would Molly. “I think my license is out of date. No point renewing it since I don’t have a car. Why do you ask?”Sherlock pulled his mind away from potential experiments on the head and smiled at Molly.“There’s a promising case in Horsham and I wondered if you’d like to come with me. Should only take a few days. Thought we could share the driving.”He watched her back as she placed the head with the body and returned the corpse to its drawer. Molly was his friend and since his aborted exile he was trying not to deduce his friends all the time. Deprived of its usual activity his mind chose to focus on the swing of her ponytail, calculating the arc of its motion. He blinked rapidly when she swung around to face him.“So you want me to be John for a few days?”The merriment in her tone that told him she was teasing, so he rolled his eyes and huffed dramatically.“No, Molly. I want you to be you for a few days and help me solve a case. You are not a John stand in.”Molly eyed him critically.“Did you ask John first?”“Do I look as if I’ve been on the receiving end of a head-butt? No, even I’m not so socially unaware that I would ask John to leave London this close to Mary’s due date.”She snorted a laugh and smiled at the thought of John’s irate and disbelieving face had Sherlock asked. “Okay. A few days away solving crime sounds fun.”There was a tiny, tiny part of Molly’s mind that said that solving crimes was not fun for normal people. The petulant voice huffed and faded away under the influence of Sherlock’s enthusiastic smile.“Excellent! Come to Baker Street after work and I’ll explain the case.” [][][] “Mary Watson! What do you think you are doing?”With slow and heavy movements Mary carefully stepped down from the stool and balanced the paintbrush she’d been using on the side of the paint tray. With a cheery smile she turned to face her husband. John’s face was a text book picture of worry and concern.“I’m decorating the nursey John. The paint and brushes are surely a hint.”His lips thinned as he bit back the snarky response that tried to rush forward. That wasn’t the only comment her husband was trying to hold in. Mary gave a soft sigh and settled herself in the slide and glide rocking chair that Sherlock had picked out for them.“Okay. Let the fussing and fretting out before you explode. I’m ready.”John drew in a deep breath and the words came rushing out of his mouth as if his brain had turned on a high powered hose.“You could have fallen; or gone dizzy and fallen; or gone into labour and fallen! What about the paint fumes? They can’t be any good at all for you and the little one. You’re due in less than ten days. You need to be resting Mary. Please.”John’s chin dropped on to his chest and his hands clenched at his sides. Mary waited quietly until his shoulders started shaking with soft laughter. He rubbed the back of his neck as he looked up at her sparkling eyes.“I’m sorry, love. I never thought I’d turn into one of those fussing dads-to-be.”Mary giggled along with him, but then jumped slightly as the baby kicked. John crossed the room in a flash and knelt by the chair staring at the bump with a look of awe on his face.“I saw that one. She’s got a hell of a kick on her.”“Trust me; I’m well aware of that.”John kissed her hand and rubbed his hand over her huge stomach. Mary ran her fingers through his short hair.“You’ve got to remember that I’m pregnant, not made out of glass. To be honest I’d be happy to go into labour early. I’m sick of being as big as a bus.”John gave her a wonky smile.“I know you’re tough as nails, love. It’s the caveman in me. I’m always going to worry about my girls.”“You can express your manly concern by making me a cuppa and explaining why Molly Hopper is texting me to find out how to make s’mores.”John pushed himself to his feet and held a hand out to Mary.“It’s for a case. I think.” [][][][] Molly had done all of the driving from London to Horsham. She’d been right that her license was expired, but Sherlock having a brother in a minor position in the British government came with some perks. That Mycroft had somehow convinced the DVLA to renew Molly’s license and deliver it by courier in less than four hours had to be the most blatant display of the pull he actually had that Molly had every witnessed. Faking Sherlock’s death had been complex and amazing, but seriously cowing the DVLA was something else altogether. A“Molly and Sherlock on a road trip? Oh, I wish I could be a fly on the wall for that one!”AAJohn snorted.AA“Sherlock’s a pretty good driver. Surprisingly. He actually focuses on the road, most of the time.”AA“Nope. Can’t picture that at all.”A Sherlock had spent the journey glued to his phone doing as much research as possible. Several times during the hour and a half journey he muttered about the deplorable fact that the campsite had no Wi-Fi service. How was anybody expected to function without internet access, or decent mobile signal? Why would anyone think such a Luddite attitude was an advertising feature?  A“John have you seen the website for this place they’re going?”AA“Yeah. Why?”AA“It’s going to be rather cosy for the two of them don’t you think?”AAJohn read the description of the Shepard’s Hut that Sherlock had booked for Molly and him. His laughter was loud in the warm kitchen. AA“Poor Molly. Sharing a bed with Sherlock is going to be an education for her.”AA“Speaking from experience there, husband?”AA“I’ll tell you about York, but you can’t breathe a word of it to anyone. People would definitely talk.”A “This is so much better than camping when I was a kid.”Molly twirled in the middle of the Shepard’s Hut and smiled at Sherlock. When he’d told her that their destination was a campsite where some very odd things were happening, Molly had braced herself for battles with tent poles and a few nights of trying in vain to find soft ground to sleep on. He’d quickly corrected her notion and explained that this was a Glamping site.AInstead of sleeping on lumpy ground under damp canvass their accommodation was a quaint little hut kitted out like a gypsy caravan. Glamping might have a silly name, but she was starting to see the appeal.Sherlock was eyeing the only bed with a strange look on his face. He’d warned Molly they would need to share since this was the last ‘tent’ available on site. Molly had taken that in her stride; although they’d never slept side by side she was used to Sherlock using her place as a bolthole. If she could cope with seeing Sherlock before either of them had had a cuppa she could cope with anything.The double bed completely filled one end of the hut. It touched three of the walls so the only access was to climb in from one side. It looked snug, very snug. Molly gave the bed a hard look then looked up and down Sherlock’s tall form.“No, I’m not sure that the bed is long enough for me either Molly.”She gave a shrug.“If you do decide to sleep, what with being on a case and all, we’ll work something out.”He gave the bed a final frown and started towards they door. Molly almost laughed at loud as she watched him have to shorten his stride in the small space.“Shall we go and solve this puzzle?” A“There are pitches for actual tents free for this weekend. Why didn’t Sherlock book one of those?”AAJohn’s voice carried a touch of sadness.AA“Sherlock loathes camping. Says it reminds he too much of sleeping rough when he was homeless. The junkie years.”A The case turned out to be brain numbingly simple. Sherlock had it solved within three hours of arriving at the site. Molly had taken detailed notes because she knew this was one John would want to write up for the blog; animal mutilation, strange lights and noises at night and crop circles all faked to set the idea of aliens in the minds of the locals. The whole elaborate affair had been devised to be a smoke screen for an elopement. Sherlock’s eyes had rolled so hard at the pair of lovers that Molly thought he might strain his optical muscles.She gave the Shepard’s Hut a wistful look when they returned after speaking with the local police. It was a good thing she hadn’t unpacked, one less thing to do before Sherlock insisted they head back to London. It would have been nice to have spent one night glamping, just so she could say that she’d tried it. “What did you do on camping trips when you were a kid?”Molly sat on the end of the bed, a fond smile of memory on her face.“The usual stuff I suppose. Exploring, visit nearby castles or the beach, fishing. The best bit was cooking over a campfire. Mum and Dad would let us stay up late and toast marsh mallows. Dad would point out all the constellations when it got dark and Mum would tell ghost stories. It was simple, but fun.”Sherlock was folded into one of the chairs, his fingers steepled under his chin as he watched her. His intense stare didn’t make her feel as uncomfortable as it once did, but in the close quarters of the hut it felt more intimate that it did in the lab or morgue. “There’s a fire pit outside. I can get a fire going, while you buy supplies from the shop.”Molly’s brow creased in mild confusion.“You want to stay? The case is done. I thought you’d want to hare off back to London.”Sherlock shrugged dismissively.“We’re here and paid up for the night; might as well take advantage of it. John’s not texted to say Mary’s gone into labour, so no need to rush back to Baker Street. Unless you’d rather head back now?”Molly jumped to her feet and grabbed her handbag before Sherlock could change his mind. It might be a little silly for a grown woman to be so excited about spending a night cooking over a smoky fire, but stuff it, camping was fun.“No, we should stay. I’ll go get sausages and marsh mallows and things. Is there anything particular you want?”Nope. You have the experience in this area. I’ll leave the shopping to you.”Molly stepped over his long legs as she headed towards the small shop on site. It wasn’t until she was loading her basket with sausages, buns and marsh mallows that what was happening caught up with her. She was glamping with Sherlock Holmes. She stood for a moment, eyes unfocused on the display of sauces in front of her. The image that rose in her mind caused a bubble of laughter to escape her throat. Sherlock in his bespoke suit toasting marsh mallows over a campfire; oh she hoped she could snap a picture of that.There was to be no picture an overdressed Sherlock doing anything with a campfire. When Molly returned to the Shepard’s hut she found Sherlock had changed his clothes. Her jaw tighten at the sight, last time she’d seen him dressed in combats and a baggy hoodie she’d been testing him for drugs.“Don’t panic Molly. I’m not high, nor planning to get that way. These clothes seamed more fitting for camping.”He’d had his back to her when he started to speak, but had turned to face her. His kaleidoscope eyes met hers and she found nothing but honesty and sincerity within them. She relaxed and nodded.“I was hoping to get a photo of you in your suit toasting a marshmallow.”Sherlock chuckled.“Glad I go changed. John would crow far too much over that!” AJohn finished the brush stroke carefully, his tongue sticking from the corner of his mouth as he concentrated on painting along the edge of the window frame. Mary was in the rocking chair looking at her phone.AA“Sherlock’s solved the case.”AA“So they’ll be heading back then?”AA“Nope Molly says they’re staying for the night anyway. Cooking bangers on a campfire.”AAJohn gave his wife a bemused look.AA“How did Molly talk him into that?”AAMary gave him a knowing grin.AA“She didn’t it was Sherlock’s idea.”AAJohn’s eyebrows almost jumped of his head they shot up so fast.AA“Really? Wow. Why is my first instinct to make him pee in a cup?”AAMary batted his arm.AA“Be nice. You know he’s sweet on Molly. In his own strange way. Still camping under the stars, roaring fire, maybe they’ll get their act together tonight.”AAJohn snorted.AA“You know girlfriends aren’t his area, love.”A Sherlock watched the sausages cooking with the intensity that Molly had only seen before when he was wrapped up in an experiment. He tore his gaze away from the browning meat.“When will they be done?”Molly had to giggle, Sherlock sounded like an excitedly impatient five year old. “Soon. Trust me; you don’t want to eat them half cooked.”He took a resigned sip from the bottle of cider Molly had bought.“No, food poisoning is not a fun experience.”“Did you experiment on yourself?”Sherlock gave her an incredulous look.“No. I was just a terrible cook at uni.”Molly stared at him and then the pair of them burst into laughter, which turned into a panicked yelp as the fire flared up and ignited on of the sausages.“Bugger!”Sherlock leapt up brandishing the long handled BBQ fork. He managed to flick the flaming banger off the grill. His look of triumph was quickly quelled as the dry grass started to smoulder. Molly was helpless with laughter as Sherlock stomped the fire out, employing some of John’s choicest curses as he did so. His pale skin was flushed by the time he’d conquered the small flames.“Now I understand why you insisted on cooking extra.”They paid close attention to the remaining sausages and had no further casualties. Sherlock eat with gusto, which wasn’t surprising since he’d solved the case. He swallowed the last bite and stared up at the sky.“What star is that?”Molly followed his pointing finger and shook her head. Sherlock’s lack of knowledge about the solar system was still a talking point after all these years.“That’s not a star; it’s a planet, Venus. Second planet from the sun and the brightest object in the night sky. It’s covered in thick clouds of sulphuric acid that cause it to reflect so much of the sun’s light.”As the evening grew darker Molly pointed out various constellations and Sherlock told her the stories from Greek and Roman mythology that gave them their names.“I would have thought you’d have deleted mythology.”“Hum, it’s persistently stubborn. Probably because I learnt about it when I was so young. Just hard wired in there now.""Sated for now they talked over the case. Molly told Sherlock what she knew about alien abduction and UFO sightings. He teased her a little for watching such crap telly, but then tried to come up with rational explanations for each report. Without all of the data it was pure speculation, but some of Sherlock’s suggestions were more outlandish that the actual reports, so Molly grinned so much so thought her face might ache tomorrow. Feeling peckish again they toasted marshmallows and even tried making s’mores. “I’m not sure we’re doing this right.”Molly licking melted chocolate and molten marshmallow from her fingers, all the while wondering if American kids had asbestos fingers to handle these things with such apparent ease. Sherlock had dropped the gooey mess down the front of his hoodie. He ran his finger through the mess before popping the digit into his mouth and sucking it clean. Molly knew the blush that rose to her cheeks had nothing to do with the fire, but that’s what she was blaming. Sherlock was frowning at the stain on his hoodie.“There’s something grimly appealing about these treats. They should be disgusting, but they’re moreish.”The rain started so suddenly they both jumped. Molly’s yelp covered the strangled sound Sherlock made. The next few moments were a flurry of activity as they grabbed the remains of their meal and cooking equipment and rushed into the hut.Molly wiped the rain from her face and peered into the downpour at the fire pit.“Guess the weather will take care of that for us.”Sherlock only hummed in response, but Molly caught the note of disappointment in the sound.“What’s wrong?”“We were having fun and the weather’s spoiled it.”She gave his arm a quick squeeze.“It’s not a real camping trip unless it rains. Besides we have this little hobbit stove, so we won’t be freezing. We can make some hot chocolate if you’d like.” “Can we put marshmallows in it?”He sounded shy as if he was worried Molly would laugh at him for being childish. She answered with mock seriousness.“It would be a terrible waste of marshmallows if we didn’t.”",S'more Cosy.,3942

Even with her seated by the stove and Sherlock sitting cross legged on the bed scarcely five feet separated them. They’d stood and worked closer than this before, but in this tiny, warm space everything felt heightened. The rain drumming on the roof added to the sensation of being cocooned and isolated from the world.Molly poured the drinks and added some marshmallows. Sherlock grinned like a little kid as he accepted his mug, but his joy faded as Molly settled back into the chair.“Come sit on the bed Molly. You’ll be more comfortable.”Molly’s head tilted in surprise as Sherlock shifted closer to one of the walls. He didn’t have far to go and it dawned on her that he’d left space for her from the start. Her heart swelled at the gesture, considerate Sherlock was a rare experience and she knew she was one of the select few to be deemed worthy of it.They sat comfortably together drinking hot chocolate and talking about the interns Molly was supervising at Barts. When Molly stretched her legs out in front of her, her feet brushed Sherlock’s thigh. Before she could pull back his long fingered hands took hold of her foot and began massaging along the arch. She stammered over what she was saying and stared at him wide eyed.“Is this alright? Do you not like having your feet touched?”“It’s fine, more than fine, just a little unexpected.”Sherlock hummed and focused on massaging her foot. He kept his eyes on the task in hand as he softly said;“I find myself wanting to touch you, all of you, all the time.”His confession hung in the air between them for seconds that stretched into eons. Sherlock’s hands faltered and stopped. He swallowed nervously and forced his head up to meet Molly’s eyes.“What do you want you, Sherlock?”“You.”Molly nodded and pulled her foot from Sherlock’s lax grasp. She knelt up and moved a little closer towards him.“Just for a holiday fling?”Sherlock shook his head rapidly.“No, I want you. You’re everywhere in my mind palace. I want it, us, to be like that outside of my head as well. I want to matter to you, to prove I’m worthy of your affection.”Sherlock was letting his emotions show on his face, uncertainty, fear and nervousness all via for dominance across his sharp cheek bones and in his multi-hued eyes. Molly licked her suddenly dry lips and moved towards him. Once more the vicious seconds elongated themselves beyond their allotted span. Molly was certain something was going to break the spell; something was going to interrupt and destroy their chance.Sherlock surged up and mashed his mouth against hers. Molly’s brain tried to report every action; his hands sliding around her waist, her melting into him, him pulling her into his lap, her fingers threading into his hair, but logic gave way to sensation and all she could feel was Sherlock, surrounding her, pouring into her, consuming her, worshiping her.The boring need to breathe made itself known and their lips separated just enough to allow it.“I don’t want to make love to you,” Sherlock gasped.A confidence Molly rarely showed caused her to roll her hips against the obvious bulge in his lap. Sherlock’s groan was sinful.“Well, obviously I want to make love to you; desperately, but not here. I want to wait until we’re back in London, so it’s real, can’t be mistaken for a holiday fling.”Molly smirked and kissed him again, her lips slid down to the perfect column of his neck and Sherlock’s head thumped back against the wall.“That is not helping my resolve Dr Hooper.”She chuckled against his throat and relented. Sherlock wanting to wait was possibly the single sweetest thing she’d ever heard. With happy smiles and quick kisses they got ready to sleep. Molly Hooper drifted into slumber wrapped in the tight embrace of Sherlock Holmes while the ever doubting part of her mind observed with slack jawed shock. [][][] Molly waved at the departing car before she rang the Watson’s doorbell. Sherlock had driven them back to London and was going to return the rental car before joining her in visiting John and Mary. Molly had been walking on air since waking up this morning spooning with Sherlock. It was struggle to stop the sheer joy showing on her face, but she wanted to tell Mary of her new relationship rather than let the observant woman deduce it. “Molly! How was camping?”Mary embraced her as much as her very pregnant belly would allow.“Oh you know. Interesting. Hello John.”John grinned in welcome and then tilted his head to one side.“Y’know Molly, most people only get mosquito bites on a camping trip.”Molly blushed and grinned happily as her hand flew to the love bite on her neck. Sherlock had just climbed into a taxi to take him back to John’s house when his phone bleeped.AWell done mate! – JWAAAbout bloody time! – MWAACongratulations brother mine.

The fear of failure looms at the edges like a thunderstorm in the horizon, but they plough on. As long as they don't stop to analyze too much, things seem deceptively simple: Sherlock has John, John has Mary, they're all a team.Lying on the sofa in his dressing gown, left sock half off his foot after being tugged at by Benjamin Watson, Sherlock reflects on the concept of jealousy. As long as he gets what all he wants in terms of John's companionship apart from those nights allocated to Mary, will it start bothering him at some point that he doesn't have exclusivity? Or will the same eventually drive Mary away or lead to such bitterness in John that their sand castle will crumble?Only time will tell. They shall plough on, one day at a time.The house is silent, even Mrs Hudson has turned off her television and ther kitchen lights no longer reflects from the aluminum shieldings via the rubbish bin canopy onto the curtain in the leftmost window of the sitting room. The house is silent, but not empty. Sherlock imagines he can sense the three other people present - baby Benjamin in Sherlock's old bedroom-turned-nursery; John and Mary upstairs. It is a comforting sort of presence, even though marred with uncertainties.2 am on a January SaturdayAJohn has succumbed to the siren song of slumber hours earlier, the flu season keeping his days at the clinic very laborious. Sherlock is still sitting by the kitchen table, peering into his microscope. Mary's film ends and she turns off the television, stretching. She turns in the armchair to peer at Sherlock. ""Aren't you going to turn in?""Sherlock adjusts the image and does not look up. ""Not tired. During cases, I rarely---""""Eat or sleep. I know. It's not wholesome, though, is it.""Sherlock sighs and looks up. Mary springs up from her chair and goes to rummage around the kitchen cabinets. She soon produces a small bag of chocolate-covered raisins which she present to Sherlock.""I thought we'd ran out,"" he comments quietly.""I have some hiding places you don't know about.""Sherlock looks at her incredulously. ""I doubt it. John is terrible at hiding things and he does most of the shopping.""""I wish you'd eat normal food. It's a bit like feeding a kid, really, no veggies, just sweets.""""The brain only utilizes glucose as its fuel.""Mary sighs. Sherlock presents the package back to her, and she opens it for him, rolling her eyes. ""Prat.""Sherlock is annoyed. He likes Mary, but only John has earned the right to refer to him with such derogatory endearments. The jury is still out whether Mary will earn this privilege.3 am on a Tuesday sometime in SeptemberAFirst there is a whimper, then a pregnant bit silence, and then the unconsolable wail of Benjamin Alexander Watson pierces the chilly night air of 221a and b Baker Street. The baby monitor distorts the noise into a shrill cacophony upstairs. John wearily flips the corner of his duvet away from his torso but can't bring himself to fully exit the warm wonderfullness of the bed yet. Next to his, Mary stirs and raises her head from her pillow, expectant. John curses quietly, and is about the pluck up the courage to expose his toes to the cold floor when suddenly the baby monitor goes almost silent. The infant is no longer crying, but a rustling of the bedding can be heard through the monitor until a blessed silence overcomes the apartment. Then, a quiet violin begins to sing. A Brahms lullaby floats through the doorway, echoing with the lagged transmission through the baby monitor.John burrows back under the covers. Mary lets her head flop back down onto his pillow and says, ""God I love that man.""4 am on a Sunday in JuneASherlock sleeps. It turns out that a valid way of curing his previously very treatment-resistant insomnia is to have a fitfully sleeping baby in the house, waking all of them up every few hours.5 am on  the same SundayAJohn gets up to drink a glass of water. First he stumbles on one of Benjamin's toys and then on Sherlock's bucket of bear innards, which upends. He draws in a deep breath, reminds himself that this holy hell is one he has cooked up for himself, and then continues to the kitchen.6 am on a snowy Wednesday morning in DecemberAThe hot water runs out during Sherlock's extensive morning routine. Mary yells until Mrs Hudson pads up the stairs to offer her a chance to shower in her apartment.7 am on a Friday in OctoberAJohn gives Sherlock a tie pin. He had originally thought about getting a ring and even sought Mary's permission to do so, but in the end felt awkward. Sherlock is confused, Mary is slightly amused and John feels like he often does - like he could have done more in a very abstract sense.8 am on some weekdayAJohn blows off work to attend a case and Mary's the one who has to reschedule his patients.9 am a year laterASherlock is convinced that a seven-month old Benjamin has uttered his first word and it's 'Sherlock'. John tells him that since even 'momma' is still proving too difficult it's unlikely the boy could have articulated such a difficult word. Sherlock is unfazed and very, very proud.10 am on Benjamin's birthdayAConsidering how little attention Sherlock pays to anyone else's birthday, it's surprising how carefully he plans the festivities for his sort-of-stepson's second one, refusing to leave such a monumentally important undertaking to the child's actual parents. Even Mycroft gets eventually invited, even though Sherlock suggests he could have easily partaken via Skype.11 am on a foggy FridayA""If the next things that comes out of your mouth contains words such as 'sentiment' or 'abritrary', I swear I'm going to smack you about the head. You're going to get your coat, put on your ridiculously poncy shoes, grab your Oyster card and go and buy John a birthday present. And make it a good one. Deduce him. I know you can do it."" Sherlock obeys.12 pm on a terrible dayAAn exhausted Sherlock is a little slower than he usually is in his deductions, and the kidnapping victim dies. Gruesomely. It's not fine. He's not fine, and it takes infuriatingly little coaxing from John to tear open the floodgates of emotion when they get back home, where Mary has stayed behind to tend to Benjamin. An hour later, an emotionally still wrecked Sherlock learns that even though hugs are pathetic and proverbial and cliched, they do help, and when it comes to the amount of huggers, more is sometimes definitely more.1 pm on Mycroft's birthday, which everybody happily ignoresASherlock and Mary have a shouting match over dishwashing duties and some unidentified phlegm found in a jar on Mary's shelf in the bathroom. John shakes his head and snaps his newspaper straight.2 pm on a busy SaturdayAJohn is used to fixing Sherlock. Patching him up, sewing up his wounds, cheering him up after a badly ended case. It turns out that the practical doctoring part is much easier to do if he has a scrub nurse at his disposal. Mary is handy in another sense as well - nagging about the benefits of a sense of self-preservation has more gravitas when done two against one.3 pm on some day in AugustAMary has the flu. Sherlock's attempts at soup are judged to be unfit for human consumption but everyone appreciates the effort anyway. And orders in Chinese.4 pm on a Wednesday in FebruaryAJohn has the flu, so it is decided that Mary will temp as Sherlock's assistant. The experiment is much more enjoyable for Mary than it is for Sherlock. There is much less adoring praise vocalized. ""Your position is not threatened,"" Sherlock announces after they have returned home and John asks how things went. He takes this as a compliment.5 pm on a day Sherlock mistook for Tuesday even though it isn't, because there hasn't been a proper case in three weeks and he's close to reaching breaking point, reallyASherlock presents John with the last of his cocaine to avoid succumbing to temptation. He needs to keep his focus now, because life is complicated and there's a baby present and look how well everything went the last time he tried to participate in the comings and goings on John's family while high as a kite. John commends him, gives him a hug and sprinkles the substance into the toilet bowl. It looks like falling snow and Sherlock is momentarily mesmerized. They tell nothing of this to Mary.6 pm on Christmas DayASherlock gifts Mary with a set of Victoria's Secret lingerie, because that is what the ladies' magazines he has consulted have suggested a male ought to purchase to the most important female in his life. John is in stitches, Mary is oddly somewhat flattered by his diligence, and Sherlock is dismayed because he cannot figure out what is so bloody funny. 7 pm on a lazy SundayAJohn and Mary return from the movies to find six ambulances and three police cars parked in front of 221b Baker Street. Turns out that Sherlock is convinced Benjamin has contracted epiglottitis and has utilized Mycroft, bomb threats, texts to Lestrade and quite a hefty dose of his acting skills to procure a good chunk of London's emergency services to their home. It turns out that the baby was merely gurgling in excitement at his new mobile. John and Mary appreciate Sherlock's level of concern and are amused, until they find out they will all be fined. Luckily Uncle Mycroft makes the whole incident disappear from police records.8 pm on a Monday like any otherAMrs Hudson visits and when she asks after John and Mary, Sherlock points to their bedroom. Mrs Hudson then accidentally walks in on them having sex. She returns to the living room, cheeks flush and angry at Sherlock. ""You should have known, dear. Really, Sherlock, embarrassing us all like that!""""It is not an uncommon occurrence and according to my experience they are perfectly capable of continuing their ministrations after being interrupted. I didn't know how urgent your business with them was so I directed you forth.""9 pm on a Monday just before EasterAAs usual, a bystander immediately assumes John and Sherlock are shagging. Sherlock confirms said person's suspicions and John groans, rubbing his eyes with the heel of his palm. Lestrade gapes and reminds them both that John is married. ""What on Earth does that got to do with anything?"" Sherlock enquires, sounding bewildered.10 pm on the darkest day of November two months after John, Benjamin and Mary have moved inAJohn stands up and ties the sash of his bathrobe tighter around his waist. ""I'm gonna turn in,"" he announces to noone in particular. Sherlock sits up, hair a bit disheleved from languishing on the sofa all day. He stares quite longingly after John who is heading to the bathroom.Mary, knitting in one of the armchairs, looks slightly amused. Sherlock looks at her expectantly and somehow she seems to know he is doing so even though she hasn't even looked up. ""Oh go on then, I know you want to,"" she comments dryly.""It's your night,"" Sherlock reminds her tentatively. Mary shrugs. Sherlock deduces this to be further confirmation that he has permission now. When he hears John opening the bathroom door and heading upstairs, he flings himself off the sofa and after the man.11 pm on a boring, boring, tedious, terrible, dreadful ThursdayACrap telly is on. John is leaning onto Mary, and Sherlock has spilled himself all over the rest of the sofa, head on John's lap. It's surprising, the amount of people you can fit into a sofa or into a relationship with some joint effort.12 pm two years laterAJudging by the sorts of muffled sounds her husband and her flatmate are starting to create behind the closed door of Sherlock's bedroom, Mary decides it's time for a moonlight walk. Oddly, she doesn't feel all that jealous. All that is going on had been going on long before she'd ever set eyes on John Watson, and without Sherlock it would've been unlikely she had ever been allowed to keep the man for so long. It is more than gratitude, however, that keeps her from becoming bitter over the fact that she shares her marriage with a third person. Sherlock had graciously stepped aside once because he'd wishes happiness for John and for Mary. It was time to return the favour.She doesn't have all that many people in her life. This means not a lot of people will care about the choices she has made or frown upon her living arrangements. Until Benjamin goes to school, that is. Still, when asked to choose between losing both her husband and the father of her child, and settling for this strange thing, the seeds of which had been planted long before she had laid eyes on John Watson, she was willing to try. Because wasn't that was life was about, in a way - making the best of a complicated situation? She had never been one to plan long-term, to go for the easy and ordinary route. Nor had Sherlock. John was the one holding onto all the common boring constructs of society's expectations, as Sherlock liked to call them. Only time would tell, whether these would prove their unraveling.They plough on. A- The End -","24 Things About The So-Called Us, or An Epilogue of Sorts",2313

I've also included the original post date where possible.,"When Sherlock asked, no demanded, that Molly stay at Baker Street after Moriarty revealed himself, she didn't hesitate. Just gathered her things and her cat. As night fell, she, reluctantly, took his bed under the agreement that he attempt to get some sleep on the couch.In the darkness of the flat, he sat up. He was certain he cried out as he did and now sat getting his breath back. It didn't take long for him to realize someone was holding his hand.A""It's alright, Sherlock."" She cooed. ""It was just a bad dream. Want me to make you tea?"" He hesitantly agreed and listened to her walk away and fondle around for the light switch in the kitchen.AWhile they waited for the kettle to boil, Sherlock retreated to his mind palace, sorting out the unsettling dream. It was just induced by stress, he knew, but he'd always been prone to them. Since he was young, he'd agonize about things in his head, mull them over, and they'd end up becoming bad dreams. So, as a teenager he began to sleep less; only when he really needed to and usually only after certain tasks were done. It made for a less troublesome and deeper sleep.AThe whistle of the kettle brought him back round and Molly presented him with a mug before sitting in ""Johns chair"", after she'd turned it to face him.A""Why are you awake?""A""Well, you called my name, so I came out to check on you."" She spoke this like it was the simplest thing in the world; he called out for her, he must need her, so she followed his voice.A""I did?""A""Yes, I came out and you were mumbling in your sleep. Cursing and tossing a bit.""A""I was?""A""Yes, you were quite animated."" A small smile graced her lips, but seeing that he was a bit embarrassed or put off, she continued. ""I wouldn't have heard or seen any of it if I hadn't heard my name."" Sherlock just nodded and sipped at his tea. ""You don't have to talk about it, but I'm here if you decide to.""A""I called your name?""A""Yes, you called my name.""A""And it was loud enough for you hear across the flat?""A""No, well, obviously, if I heard it. But, it wasn't like you shouted or screamed. I just heard you say my name.""A""I'm sorry I woke you.""A""Its ok."" With a gentle shrug, she brought her mug up to her mouth. ""I'm just glad I heard you. You seem to feel a little better."" There was no answer, he just looked off into space and took a long sip of tea. ""Anyway, you can have your bed, if you want. You're going to be busy in the morning and you should be well rested.""A""That's not necessary, Molly. You're the guest.""A""No, I insist."" They argued a bit, but in their exhaustion, decided to simply share the bed; per Sherlocks suggestion.A""Of course it's alright, Molly."" He stared at her in the doorway of the bedroom, ""Stop being silly, we're not doing anything indecent. Just sleeping."" Settling under her set of covers on her belly, facing the closet, Sherlock adjusted himself on his side, staring up at wall.

I've also included the original post date where possible.,"Molly Hooper was having one of those days. Just one of the those days. You know the kind, where you wake up late, bloated and slip in mud on your way to work…not just slip though, completely wipe out to the point where you need a change of clothes. Then, you make it to work and realize that the extra set of clothes you'd left there are at least two sizes too small so you spend the whole day worrying about bending wrong because if you crouch down, you may tear a seam. So, as she neared the end of her day, she began fantasizing about what random alcohol she had in her cabinet and how long of a bath she'd take. But, then, of course, he'd walk in.Molly may have cursed out loud, she didn't know or care. What she did know was she was going home and he couldn't stay without a babysitter. Seeing as he was alone, that meant she'd have to kick him out. With the day she'd had she was definitely ready for that. Her trainers came to a bit of a tip she wouldn't mind shoving up his….""Molly!"" He called to her, gleefully, from her doorway, but she didn't move her attention away from her paperwork.""What do you want, Sherlock?"" There was a pause for a few moments, she could hear her pen sliding across the paper.""I need some —""""No.""""Pardon?""""No body parts to spare today.""""What about —""""You're not stealing any of the chemicals, either."" Obviously there was something else he was thinking of asking about or for, but was debating on what tactic to employ.""You look…well."" Molly didn't even take the time to fully acknowledge how hilarious it was to her he was scrapping the bottom of the barrel with his attempts at manipulating her lately.""Well?! I look well to you?"" Her head had snapped up, brown eyes wide.""So… you're …. not well,then?""""No! I'm not well! I'm not well at all, you git!"" The moment she met his eyes, she knew she should stop. Briefly explain that she had had an exceptionally bad day and whatever he wanted, he'd be better off waiting, but the overwhelming need to unload all the frustration of the day in a safe place bubbled up in her chest and with a deep exhale, it unleashed itself, barely within her control. ""I woke up late this morning, I am pretty sure Toby has fleas, I have bites around my ankles and I have no idea where he picked them up or how I'm going to wash him. I haven't had sex since Tom and I broke up, six months ago and I had to cancel my date tonight because well, what would today be without my monthly visitor. Four days early. ITS FOUR DAYS EARLY! Why would it do that, Sherlock? It doesn't make sense. Its normally so predictable! But, its like a mudslide and a monsoon down there right now. I feel so unbelievably gross. When I woke up this morning so bloated, only a pair of track bottoms fit, I should have called in, but I thought it would be fine. Then I slipped in fell into this huge mud puddle and I had to change. Look at this!"" She pulled her pants away from her body to reveal the red marks they were leaving on her. ""And I can't eat anything because I'm afraid I'll pop the button off of these or break a seam. I haven't made any normal movements since I changed into these this morning because they were the only pair of trousers I had here. I'm so hungry and thirsty! I tried drinking water and it felt like it just sat in my stomach because they're just so tight. I've been yelled at today, forced to make conversations with idiots. The closest I've come to 'well' today has been seeing this stack of paperwork diminish."" Molly paused for breath. ""I've got the worst cramps I've ever had in my life, I'm a bit dehydrated, hungry, barely mobile from the waist down, I've got a headache, no feeling in my toes and the elevator scene from 'The Shining' is happening in my pants right now. So, no, I'm not well. In fact, I'm strongly fighting the urge to set this place on fire and lock you in it.""He made a few attempts at speaking, perhaps trying to choose the best words. He seemed a bit caught off guard. If she had been in better spirits, his little facial twitches and scrunches would have been amusing to her.""Well, it's a good thing you don't.""""I suppose, I mean, you'd die of smoke inhalation before the flames got to you, anyway.""""No…— well, yes, most people do, but I was thinking more along the lines of the fact that ... that would be arson, Molly""""Oh, right."" Her face went kind of dreamy, as if the thought just occurred to her. ""How long is a sentence for that?""""Well, even if you didn't kill me or anyone else in the building, the intent was there, so… life? Or close to it.""""Damn."" She breathed, flopping down on the chair with a great puff.""I'll leave you to it then."" Sherlock began to back out of the office.""Wait.. umm…"" she stood up again and gestured to the bare skin of her thigh peeking through a ripped seam; she'd sat down too hard. ""Do you have something I could borrow?"" Without a word, he took off his coat and handed it to her. ""Thank you.""""Not a problem."" As he left, she peeled the remains of trousers off and wore the Belstaff as a dress.

I've also included the original post date where possible.,"Molly had been helping Sherlock for several hours into the early morning and now it was time for sleep. She simply couldn't keep her eyes open any more and she was growing stiff from having sat in the same position on the sofa for so long.Standing up, she stretched and shook a leg lazily before walking over to the kitchen where her host (to use that phrase loosely) was messing with something 'very important' in the kitchen.""I'm going home, Sherlock."" The man simply hummed a response as she grabbed her coat and pulled it on. ""See you later."" Another hum, he obviously wasn't paying attention.As she took a big breath of chilly, London morning air and hailed a taxi, she paid one last glance up at the flat, hoping maybe he was watching. Of course, he wasn't.After another hour, he shot off a text to Lestrade and shuffled into the sitting room; Molly had left the light on. Making his way to the switch, he paused. A clump of red fabric had grabbed his attention. Bunched up on the floor, laying in a heap. Cautiously, he approached it and picked it up with equal consideration.Panties. Very sexy panties, actually. They were red and lacy with an attached garter belt… recently worn…Very nice. But, where…. Molly. These were Molly's.There were several ways he could return them to her, he thought, but which would be best… should avoid any possibility of embarrassing her… their relationship had been a bit delicate since his return and he really didn't want to rock that boat… could end badly for him… for the life of him, though, he wasn't sure which of the scenarios in his mind would be the least embarrassing for her.Obviously, they'd stuck to the inside of her trousers… she had clearly worn those more than once, being practical as she was. Must have broken its bond while she was shuffling around earlier. Either way, it wasn't like this was sorted at all… and it was him, they were friends, she shouldn't really be that embarrassed, but still… Finally decided on an option, he took a bath and a nap and threw them in with his own washing later that day. Mrs. Hudson wasn't his housekeeper, after all.Molly hadn't heard from or seen Sherlock all day, it's not like she was worried, but she was hoping he'd text her something. For the most part, he'd been better at being polite since his return and it was nice, but it still wasn't frequent. It was late and after a night of working with Sherlock, only a brief nap and a full day of working, she was, once again, exhausted. As soon as she walked into her flat, her foot hit something and it skidded across the floor, it stopped when it hit the wall underneath her couch. With a grumble, she took off her coat and moved the piece of furniture to retrieve a small manila envelope.Not thinking too much of it, she plopped it on the kitchen table and made herself some tea before opening it up, but once she did, she found herself rushing off to Baker Street.""Sherlock,"" She leaned into the sitting room breathless. ""Someone broke into my flat. I need you to check it for me.""""Who would break into your flat?"" He began questioning her, but he still grabbed his belstaff and pulled it on with a great display of flair; making a big sweeping motion with it that allowed his trademark coat to flutter. She brushed off all his questions and just insisted he come, not that he was arguing, but she had no answers. ""What did they take?""""Its… private and anyway, they returned it.""""They nicked something and returned it?""""Yes, listen, it doesn't really matter, I just want to make sure they don't get back in, alright?""After several hours, two trips to a store that was open all hours and attempting to install different locks and things to the doors and windows, Molly felt she could finally breath.""It's good now?""""Yes, its fine, Molly. Shouldn't keep you up anymore.""""Good. Just the thought of that pervert in here touching things… gives me the creeps."" She shuddered.""Pervert?"" Biting her lip and hugging herself, she glanced down at the floor and handed him the envelope.""They stole a pair of knickers and, then returned it… like I'd want it back. God knows what they did with them, they've obviously been cleaned.""""This is what had you so upset?"" Sherlock, once again, found himself holding Molly's red panties.""Well, yeah! Who does that?""""Would it make you feel better to know it wasn't an intruder?""""What do you mean?"" He didn't respond at first, he closed his eyes and sighed. This was exactly what he was trying to avoid. ""We can't all deduce as well as you, Sherlock."" When he opened them, he saw her, hands on hips, looking quite annoyed with him.""Its nothing I deduced, Molly… this was me."" He held the underwear and envelope up as if he were presenting them.""What?"" The pathologist jumped back like she had been shot at and starred at him in absolute horror. ""What on earth is wrong with you?!""""I didn't break into your flat and steal them!"" Rarely had he ever heard himself sound so panicked as he defended himself for being in possession of Molly Hoopers red panties. He took a breath and spoke more calmly. ""Look, you wore the same pair of trousers two days in a row, these were stuck in the leg. They fell out in my flat… thats all, Molly."" Great, she looked mortified. This was going well.""They fell out in your flat?"" He hoped she was ok, she appeared a bit pale.""Yes.""""Where?""""The sitting room."" With a nod, she closed her eyes and took a breath. As she exhaled, lips pursed, releasing a whooshing sound, the color came back to her face.""Why did you just leave them in an unmarked envelope, though?""""I wanted to avoid…"" He gestured wildly to the empty space between with a tight, crooked smile. ""this.""And she laughed. Curling over to grab her knees with one hand and fondling around behind her for a kitchen chair with the other. Once she was seated she looked up at him, still in the midst of her laughing fit. ""What?"" He demanded, only bringing water to her eyes, she was crying out so loudly. ""What?!""""Nothing… just…"" She composed herself to finish her sentence. ""It's kind of cute of you and so… so stupid…"" So much control over her giggles forced her to snort. ""Its so out of character for you, thats all."" The sleeve of the jumper she was wearing was now damp from the tears she wiped from her face. Maybe if she hadn't been so tired, she might of thought of that possibility herself or at least wouldn't have a wet, red face right now.""Well… umm… what should I have done, then?"" The inquiry was serious, but as silence fell over the kitchen, she realized he had been in a lose/lose situation.""Honestly, Sherlock, I'm not certain there is a right way to return a friends underwear."" Her reply was just as serious as their expressions were stoic, though both had a bit colored by now.""Right. Thats not something theres a social protocol for or anything, I didn't think. But, uh… can't say I've been in this situation before."" Trying to relieve what he perceived to be tension or awkwardness, he playfully smiled and tossed her her red panties.""Thanks, Sherlock.""

Greg Lestrade asked pouring himself a drink in the Baker Street flat.""He said he had some things to finish at St. Barts first, but he's on his way."" John planted himself on the couch next to his wife and sleeping infant daughter.

Sherlock's baritone shook the walls.""No, you listen here, William Sherlock Scott Holmes…""""Stop calling me that!""""I'll call you whatever I want, you twat! Now, move!"" The pair stomped up the stairs, still arguing with every step.""What exactly did I do wrong, Molly? What?""""Oh, you want me to tell you? Where should I start, the part where you chased my first date in a year off or the part where you insulted my nose?"" Sherlock had taken off his coat and walked directly over to his book shelf, pulling a copy of religious texts down, mumbling to himself, his reaction was a bit delayed but volatile.""I DID NOT INSULT YOUR NOSE!""""You did, too.""""DAMN IT, MOLLY!"" He lost his tempter and tossed the book across the room, breaking the orange floor lamp in the corner.""Hey, now!"" John very angrily demanded, shielding his baby, though no glass hit the couch.""Oh, so we're breaking things now, are we?"" Molly marched up to the mantel, grabbed the skull and walked back to the middle of the room before hurling at the mirror; shattering it.""My skull!"" The detective whined.""Shove it up your ass, Sherlock.""""Excuse me?""""You heard me. I didn't stutter."" The dark haired man continued to look shocked and perplexed. For a moment, the two just stared at each other and the guests, frankly, were enjoying the confusing holiday festivities. ""I don't know what has gotten into you, Sherlock. When you first came back, it was great… but then,….you started being this huge dick again. It's not fair and its not right and you need to apologize to me and start treating me well again. I don't even understand what changed."" Another paused. ""When you came back, you were so sweet. You said things I never thought you would say to me… you appreciated me and you actually respected Tom, but then we broke up and you relapsed and….""She stopped and let her mouth drop open. ""You're trying to push me away.""""What?""""No, you are… like a kid… a teenage boy who doesn't quite know what to do with the girl who sits in front of him in biology."" Molly scoffed. ""You're trying to get me to reject you because you're afraid. You're afraid to even try… aren't you?"" She was searching his face, actually deducing him and Sherlock began to feel rather small… Was this what he did to people? Was this the whole point to him when he did it? Obviously… maybe… ""Listen, Sherlock. You can't choose who you love or why, but I've always fought for you and I always will. This isn't something you rationalize. Thats the problem to you. You want to break it all down to chemicals, well, its not like that. You told me you hoped I'd be happy, what you didn't know is the day you said that was the one of best and saddest days of my adult life…. You made me happy that day, Sherlock."" She stepped to him until they were toe to toe. ""Whether I want to or not, and god I don't sometimes, I love you… unconditionally."" Molly wrapped her hands up his neck and slowly began to pull his face down to hers. ""Merry Christmas, Sherlock Holmes.""When their lips met, his were loose and didn't fight her when she parted them, he even gripped her hips a little bit with his fingertips. But, she only allowed their tongues to dance a few short moments before she pulled away, smiled and walked out of the flat without another word.A stunned consulting detective stood in the middle of his flat, trying to ground himself, surrounded by an equally perplexed doctor and DI, but Mary just cast a knowing ""I told you so"" look at her husband.""Drink?""

However, the fact that the assassin had missed Mollys heart and she was still alive reminded him this was part of a game; if Moriarty had wanted her dead, she would be.She was laying in the bed, not speaking much, but smiling a funny smile… the kind that morphine gives those with lower tolerance of drugs than himself.“Sherlock.” She croaked, before gesturing to her chest and saying “ow.” For whatever reason, this became particular hilarious to her and she began laughing and repeating “ow”.With the raise of his eyebrow and a small, discreet smile on his lips, he swaggered past the rest of their friends and reached for the morphine tap, bringing it down only one or two blips. As he did this, he rested his hand next to her on the bed, to his surprise, as well as anyone else’s, she pulled it up to her chest and proceeded to cuddle with it; spooning it as if it were a full human being, or a teddy bear or pet.“Molly, uh… may I please have my arm?”“Why? Do you need to go?” Their voices were hushed.“Well, soon, yes, if you don’t mind… I am trying to track down the man that did this to you.”“But, you don’t need to go yet.”“No, but I need to go soon.”“You’re always leaving me, Sherlock.”“I am sorry, Molly, but I told you, we want to…”“Are you running from me?” There a brief beat of silence, but Sherlock quickly broke it with a stuttered observation.“Molly, you’re high right now.”His tone changed to one a bit more stern as he glanced around the room at their audience.”Give me my arm, please.”“If John wasn’t here, you’d be sweeter to me.”“What?”“If John left, you’d be nicer… you might even kiss me.” Sherlock started pulling his arm away, though gentle, still determined.“Don’t be absurd, Molly, its nothing to do with….” She had allowed the arm to bring her closer to him, instead of just releasing it. From her close,seated position, she slid her free arm around his neck and interrupted him by smashing their lips together. Shocking the man and allowing her full enough control to deepen the kiss and pull him on top of her.“Ow!” She cried before lapsing into another laughing fit; still white knuckling his collar, holding him in place.“Yes, well,” Clearing his throat, Sherlock attempted to adjust himself on top of her, she wasn’t releasing him. “you did pull a much larger human being on top of yourself.”“I’ve had bigger.” At that moment, she released him and they gave each other panicked looks. “I meant…. men with….larger bodily proportions.”“Right.” Regaining himself, he adjusted his coat, gave his hair a bit of a fluff and turned to John. “We should… uh… get to work, don’t you think?”“Sure, yeah.” The doctor pulled his mouth into a tight, amused smile as he grabbed his own jacket and they headed out.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

BIG. And I’m cashing in.”“What?” Just then, an older woman came in, arm laced around a mans arm obviously at least ten years her junior.“Mom, Lyle… this is my boyfriend, Sherlock.”“What?”“Oh, he’s adorable!” The woman explained, leaning in and taking a firm grab of his cheeks.“Um… hello.”“Well, at least you’re seeing someone again.” Her conversation drifted from Molly back to Sherlock. “Get back up on the horse, thats what I always say, and I’ve always meant it literally.” She laughed, giving the detective a playful elbow jab and a wink.“What?”“Oh, and look at you. My, my… if we picked men out like we picked horses, you’d certainly be a fine steed, if I do say so myself.” The lady took the liberty of squeezing at his forearms, but didn’t receive much of a response, Sherlock was passing Molly a confused and slightly horrified look and all she could do was move her hands into a prayer position and mouth the word ‘please’. “So, Molly, will this fine, young buck be accompanying us to dinner?”“Buck?”“Uh… no, Sherlock has a lot going on right now, I’m not sure he can make it.”“Oi, Sherlock, thats not right. Take the night off.” Lyle finally spoke.“Uh….”“Sherlock works freelance, so when he gets jobs, he kind of needs to take them.”“Freelance.” The mother scoffed. “Well, at least he has a nice arse.”“Excuse me?”“I mean, if a man can’t keep a job, the least he can do is…”“Actually, I do think I’ll be free tonight, Molly.”“Thats great!” Molly’s mother clapped her hands together in excitement.“Are you sure, Sherlock?” His “girlfriend” asked through gritted teeth.“Positive, Molly.” He walked over and threw his arm around her. “I can take a nice, long break for dinner. I mean, after all, your mother went through the trouble of coming down to see us.”“Oh, and you would not believe how awful that journey was. I swear, I’ll never understand why you love London so much, Molly.” The woman hardly noticed her daughter starring daggers at her ‘boyfriend’, she was self absorbed in her own little story.“Thats awful, I’d love to hear all about it, but I think we should be leaving soon, shouldn’t we?” Sherlock interrupted.“Oh, right! Went through all the trouble of making a reservation, we’d hate to be late!” She exclaimed.“Absolutely, why don’t you two go catch a cab and we’ll be right out.” Of course, they quickly agreed and he ushered them out of the lab.“What…was… that, Sherlock?”“What was what?”“You invited yourself to dinner!”“Correction, they invited me.”“No, they invited my boyfriend to dinner.”“Which they think I am, so they invited me, I accepted.”“Why?”“I’m… hungry?”“No, why?”“Does it matter?”“I don’t know… maybe?”“Look, Molly, does it bother you that much?” She paused for a moment and worried at her bottom lip.“I suppose not…”“Good, then…”“But, behave yourself… they think you’re my boyfriend and my mother now assumes your unemployed, unfortunately.

Tom had just left to have a late dinner and drinks with some of his uni mates leaving Molly alone in the sitting room, sighing over a book she’d read about twenty times since she was sixteen. Their dog announced her visitor as he knocked, completely obliterating the silence and forcing her to jump.A    The labrador calmed itself, though, before she looked the peephole and flung open the door.A“Sherlock?”A“Hello.”A“You knocked.”A“You told me I should make sure to do that.”A“Right.”A“May I come in?” At that moment, it registered to Molly she was blocking the doorway.A“Of course.” She stepped back, allowing him to walk in and Sherlock allowed the cat and dog to ‘frisk’ him, though he let out a strange noise when the lab sniffed at the front seem of his trouser and Sherlock gently pushed him away.A“Now, now, no need to get too personal.” Sherlock smiled.A“So, what brings you here, Sherlock?” For a moment, he just stared at her. She had to say, she enjoyed putting him on the back foot and evening out the playing field, but she didn’t like it when he had trouble trying to talk to her about something important. It made her feel good to have his confidence. Receiving it was quite a feat and to think he would hesitate to confide in her now was worrisome. She allowed him to stutter a bit, but ended it quickly. “Whats wrong?”A“Nothings wrong.” He laughed.A“Yes, something is wrong.” Sighing and pursing his lips, he took a few moments to pick his words.A“I just wanted to see you, Molly. So, I came down to see you.”A“Was that so hard?”A“Actually, a bit.” He admitted, twitching his face.A“Wine?” She offered, picking up her empty glass.A“Sure.”A                                                                                          *       *       *                                                                                                             AThe wine had quickly gone to their heads and they were laughing at nothing in particular. Sherlock had taken to throwing popcorn at the muted television and “boo”-ing whenever a particular character came on.A“Ugh.” He shook his head and gestured to the couple on the telly.A“What?” Molly asked.A“That couple…. they’re awful together… I mean, they must know.”A“They could work… I mean, the story suggests that they do.” Apparently, this was debatable.A“They won’t work, like you and …Tom.” He spat.A“What about us?” If she wasn’t drunk, she’d probably be offended, but instead, she sounded sad.A“I wasn’t going to say anything.” He whispered.A“No, no,… I… I wanna know.”A“Fine… its… your entire relationship is based on sex. Its apparent you find him very skilled.” Sherlock swallowed hard, but rolled his eyes. “I mean, he obviously doesn’t mind hearing about your job, but he doesn’t understand or respect it… he sees it as something he has to do… a responsibility. And… and… he doesn’t really want kids, Molly. Certainly, you see that.”A“What?B-but, we’ve talked about it… you’re lying!”A“Nope… doesn’t like kids.” He sunk back in his chair and Molly stared at him, mouth agape. “He’s compromising… hoping you’ll decide you only want one.”A“Why didn’t you tell me before?”A“Because,… I wanted you to be happy and I… I still think he could make you happy.”A“No, you don’t.”A“Well, they’re are compromises made in every relationship… I think, honestly, you could… end up content.”A“Friends are honest with each other.”A“Please, don’t me cross with me.”A“I’m not cross.” She slurred.A“Good… because.. I.. I know you were talking about dates…”A“Yes?”A“Please, don’t… don’t”A“Sherlock…”A“Don’t marry him, Molly.”A“Sherlock…”A“I’m begging you, Molly.” He pulled himself off the couch and positioned himself in front of her, on his knees. “Please, don’t marry Tom.” As she looked him up and down, she decided she wished she wasn’t drunk anymore.A“You should leave.”A“I will gladly leave, just please tell me you won’t marry him.”A“I can’t make that promise, Sherlock.” She shook her head. “He loves me… unlike some people.”A“You don’t think I love you, Molly?” An obvious flash of pain shot through his eyes. “I’m desperate for you, Molly. I’m begging you,Molly, please… please, don’t marry Tom.” For a moment, Molly allowed her hand to rest on his cheek and he kissed the palm.A“And why, exactly, should I leave, Sherlock?” He said nothing, but pulled them both to their feet placed her back against the opposite wall, kissing her with a fervor she’d never felt from any lover before.AShe could taste the cigarette he’d smoked on his way over a few hours ago and was intoxicated by his musk.A“May I, Molly?” Sherlock pulled away and placed his hand inside the waist band of her trousers. Before she could say anything, the door opened and in walked Tom.AGracefully, Sherlock slid his hand away. The positions the two were standing in when Tom turned around and saw them both was still compromising, but less obvious.A“Evening, Tom.” Sherlock crooned with a smirk.A“Molly, is—uh— is Sherlock bothering you?”A“No—no, Tom he’s not. He was just in the neighborhood, so he stopped by.”A“Is he pissed?” Her fiancé demanded.A“Well, Tom, we did have some wine. He didn’t expect to drink so he asked to borrow some cash for a cab.” Quickly, the pathologist turned around and grabbed a few bills out of a change bowl on the coffee table. “He was just heading out, why don’t you put on some tea and we’ll have a culpa before bed?” Tom agreed as Molly ushered Sherlock out the door.A“Molly,” The detective whispered in the hallway with a desperation she’d never heard before. “Tell me what do you need to say, to do… what do I need to give you to say you won’t—“A“Sherlock,” She hissed.A“— Marry him. Molly, I will get back on my knees and plead with you if I must… I’d split the sky in two if it where possible and lay the stars and moon at our feet.”A“You’re drunk.”A“Don’t be so cold, Molly. Can’t I dare to wish to kiss you like that forever?”A“Stop this.” She demanded, “stop this, now.”A“What do you want to hear, huh?”A“I want to hear you leaving?”A“Nothing says ‘I love you’ like a desperate man.” He scoffed.A“Molly?” The voice of Tom interrupted them.A“Leave, now.” Her tone was fierce and unflinching.A“A well.” Sherlock stopped the door from closing in his face.A“What?”A“I would throw myself down the deepest well if you asked.” Molly seemed to consider this for a moment, but appeared to dismiss it as symptomatic of their drunken state.A“Good night, Sherlock.” She didn’t let him catch the door this time. “Coming, Tom.” Somehow, it felt wrong slamming the door in Sherlock’s face, but she made her escape to the kitchen just the same and sat down with Tom to drink some chamomile tea before bed.A“So, he gone?” He asked, placing the cup and saucer in front of her.A“Oh, yeah. Just a little confused. I mean,he doesn’t drink much.”A“Really?”A“No,”she tried not to sound offended. “he rarely drinks, actually. Doesn’t like things that make it hard for him to work.”A“Oh,” Tom held his tongue as Molly took a loud sip of her tea and stared at the wall beyond him. “So— uh— the date? Do you want to pick a date?” For a minute, she appeared confused, lost in her own thoughts.A“Hmm? Oh!” She smiled at him. “The wedding date.”",A Collection of One Shots,10485

It genuinely was an accident… but I won.” Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from chuckling as they exchanged smiles.“It was about me, wasn’t it.” He almost whispered, glancing at the floor.“Yes.” Of course, Molly wouldn’t even try to lie about it. That was one of the things he loved about her the most; her fierce loyalty to him extended to always giving him the truth when he asked for it.“How do you do it, Molly?”“Do what?”“The way you do it just… seems so effortless… natural.” He shrugged.“Do what, Sherlock?”“Keep your faith in me.” The clatter of her tea cup being set back on the saucer was much louder than it should have been in the tiny flat. “I’ve said and done awful things to people, Molly, including you and probably always will… I- I let you down, all the time.”“No, you don’t, Sherlock.” She quietly corrected.“But, you’re still here… by my side… like it never happened.”“Thats what friends do.”“Well, I’m not the best friend someone could ever have.”“You have no idea, do you, Sherlock?” Her expression was a little sad as she got up and began walking toward him.“I’ve hurt you, Molly. But, you still come back.” Toe to toe with him now, she gingerly took his hands in hers.“Relationships… all relationship are something you have to work on. There were nights we lost the touch and good days that went by way too fast and times where it takes all I’ve got to try to make that … that feeling last.” She gestured between them. “But, I’m going to keep on loving you, Sherlock.”“Why?” Mollys voice caught in her throat and she felt her eyes well up.“Because I can’t not love you, Sherlock. You’re worth it to me.” The force with which his lips where pressed to hers knocked her off her feet and took her breath away. His large,strong arms were all encompassing and the only thing keeping her from hitting the floor and she clung to him as one would if he was the only thing keeping them from falling off a cliff into oblivion. She didn’t want the kiss to end; it was like every breath she’d ever taken and every emotion she ever felt all at once, but he had to eventually pull away.“I’d make a rubbish boyfriend but…would you let—““Yes,” she interrupted. “Yes, Sherlock. God, yes, of course.”“You didn’t let me finish.”Still holding on to her like she was life itself, he managed to look a bit affronted.“Did I need to?”“Well… you didn’t know what I was going to say… and.. and that might change your answer.”“Oh.” Molly knew he saw she felt deflated.“I was going to say that, I’d make a rubbish boyfriend, but would you let me try to make a good husband?” Still not on her own two feet, wrapped in his arms and teetering at an angle, her breath hitched and her jaw dropped as she starred up at him. “Not good?” He squinted a bit as he searched her expression, looking for a tell tale sign of her thoughts, but ended up appearing a bit panicked himself. “Damn it, Molly, please, say something.” She couldn’t help but laugh.“It doesn’t change my answer, Sherlock. Not a bit.” His sigh of relief was obvious and heavy as a smile spread a crossed his lips. “I’d marry you right now if the courthouse were open.”“I—I can ring Mycroft.”“You’re serious?”“If thats what you want.” He set her on her feet properly.“Phone him.” She said, burying her face in his chest with a smile on her face.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

Working slowly, quietly, with purpose. He wasn’t even sure what had brought him down to St. Barts that evening. Well, he didn’t want to admit it to himself. He’d done this before; just watched her. Sometimes, she’d play music, but since she recorded many of her notes, music was primarily played only when she was cleaning up. Sherlock smiled to himself as he saw her slowly begin moving her hips to the music. For just a few moments, he allowed himself the freedom to imagine just walking in and waltzing her around the room. Molly appeared to be a natural, it would go smoothly, they’d glide across the morgue and she’d smiled at him, he’d return it and they’d just set the morgue on fire with their nimble, learned feet. He’d twirl her, dip her and she’d finally have a dance partner who’d catch her when she,playfully, attempted a leap. She would be the best dance partner he’d never have; he knew this. But, sometimes, only sometimes, usually late at night, when he couldn’t smoke or shoot up, he’d allow himself these dreams. And they’d only be dreams… Dreams of whisking her around as she artfully followed his lead. He’d imagine how her curves would feel in the palm of his hand and how her fingers would feel running through his curls. He could see, in his minds eye, how she’d know every move and trust him to lead, and later… if she allowed him to, he’d return the favor in a less civilized manner. Sherlock would stop these flights of fancy; these pubescent day dreams before their lips even met, though. Before their gaze became heated and intoxicating. Before either of them would speak.“You’re becoming a bit predicable, brother dear.” Mycrofts voice broke his revery. He didn’t answer or turn to face him, and the elder brother responded with a heavy sigh… as if his exhale could fill the silence like a balloon. “John was worried about you.” The elder Holmes continued, fiddling with his umbrella. “Thinks you’ve possibly fallen off the wagon.” Sherlock didn’t move, continued to stare into the morgue, back turned to his brother. “You need to stop breaking in to stare into a darkened morgue, Sherlock, people will talk.”“People rarely do anything else.” His mouth was dry, but he didn’t allow his speech to reflect that.“We’ll find her, Sherlock.”“I’m not a child, Mycroft.”“No, you’re not… but you’ll never find her if you’re too busy startling the staff. No one will work nights in here anymore because of you.” Sherlock glided his vision over the blackened, bleak room. No matter what he did, he heard her ghost, saw her ghost. Chances are, she wasn’t even dead, and, yet, she was haunting him. “She is resilient, Sherlock.” Silence again. Certainly, Mycroft had deduced Sherlock was recalling his own experiences in captivity. The elder took another loud, heavy exhale. “Are you ready to go?” Sherlock winced a bit at Mycroft’s tone; there was uncharacteristic sensitivity in it, when he didn’t respond, Mycroft brought a cigarette up to his shoulder. “Lets take a walk.” Hesitantly, Sherlock accepted the blight gift and finally picked up the boots that usually felt heavy with indecision in this room.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

No one said anything, but John and he both noticed that Sherlock was all but dragging his feet, head hung low.The pathologist must have never worked with Molly or recognized her. Made sense, though, letting a pathologist work on a familiar body was highly unusual, but the men weren’t deaf to the casualness of his voice. Obviously he wasn’t use to working with living people.Still, no one said anything.The pathologist slid the sheet down to Molly’s shoulder. Mycroft and John ignored Sherlocks wince. He was stone faced, emotionless… they could feel the cold emanate off of him. It was only little hints that those who knew him and Molly noticed. To anyone else, he appeared indifferent. His hands cupped behind his back, gently swaying from one leg to the other and uncharacteristically worrying at his lower lip. A habit he’d acquired from her, no doubt.Still, no one said anything.The confirmation of her identity was made with unanimous nods rather than verbal affirmations. As the man reached out to grab the sheet, the long fingers of the consulting detective wrapped around his wrist. The pathologist glanced up at Sherlock, who was still expressionless. Seeing no real prompt from the tall, dark man, he looked to the brother and friend for a cue. Mycroft simply looked at the ground, sighing, but John gave a nod before assuming the same position. When the man returned to look back up at Sherlock, he still was starring down at Molly.Still, no one said anything.The message clear to everyone, they filed out together, leaving Sherlock alone with his pathologist. He waited until he heard the door click close before he allowed himself to relinquish control. To loosen the grip on his emotional gauge that he’d twisted so tight. His sniffle echoed through the room, before a barely audible cry filled the morgue as he folded in on himself, placing his forehead to hers. At that moment, he held fast to himself, but he couldn’t stop the tears from flowing. Silently, they streamed down his cheek, patting onto her face like a gentle rain.Still, no one said anything.He pressed his lips to her cold, stoney ones, briefly, bidding her to wake up.Fairy tales. He thought.No one said anything.There was nothing to be said. No words could have verbalized the pain, the sorrow, the regret.

The warm water flowing over his body, it was alright to let go. The few times in his life he had cried as an adult had been in a shower. But, today wasn’t like that. He was numb.A        This morning, he was going away. His brother had told him he would be dead in six months. But, he felt nothing. Not until the chill of the water registered with him and he realized he was shivering a bit.A—————————————————————————————A        When he told her what had happened and that she couldn’t see him again, she hadn’t felt anything. Shocked to her core. In the darkness of her bedroom, she held fast to the pillow he had used while utilizing it as an office of sorts…. the web he had built was still up on her wall.A        It had caused many fights with Tom, who had opted to sleep on the sofa while she sat with him for long hours and allowed him to bounce ideas off of her.A        That morning, it was still damp with her tears. She must have been crying in her sleep.A—————————————————————————————A        The entire time he got ready, the only thing he could remember thinking was ‘whats the point?’. Truth be told, there really was none. It didn’t matter if he shaved or donned his Spencer Hart… not today.A        This numbing… anti-pain was akin to the feelings he had before he met John Watson. When he spent every waking moment not on a case contemplating the most interesting way to kill himself. Fittingly, he had a fixation for an extended period of time with throwing himself off a roof. He figured New Scotland Yard or St. Barts… they were both important to him in some way.A        Now, he would have no say in how he was going to die. It was an odd feeling. Not having a pull either way; towards survival or death. His only hope was that it might be quick, but that was unlikely.A        With how dead he already felt, it might be a relief to feel the pain that would foreshadow his death.A        The offer of breakfast that morning felt too much like a last meal, he knew he wouldn’t have been able to stomach it anyway.A—————————————————————————————A        Slowly, she peeled herself off of the bed and tried to put herself together for work. Shockingly, she brushed and braided her hair, but as she brought the lipstick to her vacant smile, she froze in place. His words from years ago echoed in her mind. All the ones he spoke pertaining her wearing lipstick.A        ‘….are you wearing lipstick?’A        ‘….mouths to small, now.’A        ‘…echoes the lipstick….’A        It hit the sink with a clatter and she simply walked out of the bathroom and walked out of the apartment. It didn’t matter anyway.A—————————————————————————————A        He had meant to tell John. But he couldn’t. The words got stuck in his throat. In his mind, he had even practiced it.A        ‘I meant it when I said I love you, but I never got to say that to Molly. Will you watch over her for me?’A        Instead, he told a joke about his name. A lame one,too. But, John had laughed. And thats how he wanted to remember John, anyway.A        Molly was a guardian angel, brandishing love valiantly. Sometimes, it needed to be tough, sometimes it needed to be soft. John was his friend… and he wanted to,… needed to remember him happy.A    It felt good to laugh. But, moments later, he had relinquished his composure for a moment in the jets lavatory. Sometimes it was necessary to purge this painful emotions.A—————————————————————————————A        Nothing could will a smile onto her face today. But, her expression changed the moment Moriarty’s face flashed onto her little office telly. She’d frozen in place and,for the first time that day, her mind started working.A        What did this mean? What would happen to Sherlock?A        Sure, she’d wondered what it might mean for her, but she was much more concerned about him.A—————————————————————————————A    The second his brother made it clear the jet was turning around, he physically felt life breath into him. Though he exhaled it with annoyance, it was partially because he was in shock about the whole thing and didn’t quite know if anything that happened since shooting Magnussen was real.A        As the planes wheels touched down, his first though was of rushing off to Barts.A—————————————————————————————A    She was still staring at the screen when he came him and positioned himself in front of her.A    “Molly?” She looked up in to his eyes and felt her knees buckle a bit, but he caught her. His reflexes where catlike.A    “Sherlock?” She felt a single warm tear hit her cheek.A    “Yes.”A    “But, you were—“A    “What? Do you really think my brother would send me away with Moriarty back? Don’t be—“ She stopped his words with the deepest kiss she’d ever exchanged with anyone.A                                   He came back.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

Which is what she was combining during the instructors lecture. As she gave all her focus to the anatomically correct heart on her page, she was interrupted by her name as the teacher pushed passed.“Miss Hooper.” The instructors voice boomed and Molly shot up as fast as she could, nearly taking the desk with her.“Yes, Miss Harlan?”“I thought you could answer the question, I mean, since you obviously already know the material.” Molly’s heart thundered in her chest. She could name every piece, every part and all the proper names of every function her cardiac system, but god help her if she didn’t even hear the question. Panicked she glanced around the room. Just as Miss Harlan was taking her seat and making another biting comment, the boy who sat beside her, with dark curls and a constant air of annoyance, nudged her. Her eyes fluttered down to the paper he was discretely gesturing to with his pen.“July 10th, 1460, ma’am.”“Very good, Miss Hooper. Who won?” As carefully as possible, she followed his lead, reading what he wrote on the paper out of the corner of her eye without thinking.“The Yorks, ma’am. Lord Grey de Ruthyn betrayed the kings entrenchments. 300 were killed and the king was taken prisoner. Among the dead were many prominent men including Buckingham, Shrewsbury, and Egremont. Now, if you wouldn’t mind I think we’d all appreciate it if you would return to attempting to teach the class,though below level, rather than pick on a student because her hair and the smell of her bath soap reminds you of your husbands mistress.” As soon as Molly finished reading that last sentence, she could feel herself going pale again and her heart rate increasing. Her eyes went wide for a moment and she swallowed, the instructor said nothing, simply stood up and left the room crying.“Sherlock Holmes, what the bloody hell did you make me say that for?”“Me? I didn’t make you say anything. You chose to say it.” Students around them were floundering around, already deciding to abandon the class.“No, I was happy you were helping me and I gratefully accepted it in good faith. You had no right to write something so vile when you knew very well I was going to say it.”“Well,” He stood up and gathered his own books. “You are welcome.”“What?” Molly called back as he pushed past her.“You said you were grateful for my help. I said you were welcome… is that not what I was suppose to say?” Honestly, Sherlock looked like he might be genuinely confused.“No, Sherlock, thats what you say. But, I would like an apology for tricking me like that.” When Sherlock chortled, in an attempt to dismiss her, she grabbed his arm. “I mean it, Sherlock Holmes. Apologize.” He studied her for a moment, considering.“I’m sorry, Molly Hooper. I will never betray your trust like that again, especially under the guise of assisting you.”“Apology accepted… now, was that so hard?”“Actually, yes it was. I don’t think I did anything wrong, I mean, she was completely in the wrong to pick on you like that. You should really learn to stand up for yourself more. I did you a favor.” As he disappeared around the corner, Molly wasn’t sure how she felt about their conversation, but it was obvious to her that, perhaps, Sherlock would be a very good ally in any war… florally named or not.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

I've also included the original post date where possible.,"Molly Hooper stood in between the glass sliding door that separated the living room from the kitchen, hands on hips, glaring down Sherlock Holmes. From his seat, he gently twitched, fighting the physical compulsion to fidget in his seat under the fire of daggers shooting from Molly’s eyes.“Did I hear you right?” He shrugged, avoiding her eye contact as the sound of her toes tapping against the kitchens linoleum seemed to amplify in the space. “Did you just tell Marcus that Sheryl Watson was my child?”“I may have.” Again, no contact as he lifted his hand to rub his neck. “But, it was for your own good.” Sherlock insisted, pushing himself up out of his chair. As he pivoted to walk towards his computer on the desk, he made sure to keep his eyes downcast. Still furious, Molly joined him in the sitting room, picking up a sleeping Sheryl Watson from the sofa.“I’m going to run her up to bed because no child should hear the words I have for you, Sherlock Holmes.” She hissed at him in a whisper, careful not to wake the sleeping baby they were sitting. As she tiptoed up the stairs, Molly began to fume. It was likely he’d been doing this since she moved in fives months ago, after all, she hadn’t had but one date since she got her key.The only reason that she could think that he would possibly do this was because he was afraid of being alone so long with such a young baby. After all, Sheryl wasn’t even a year old yet and hadn’t developed much in the realm of communication. Molly had suspected for a while that his own lack of ability to deduce the baby had frightened him on some level, she’d seen the slight look of panic on his face as he bounced her while she cried for no apparent reason.At that moment, though, tiny Sheryl barely made any sort of a fuss as Molly pushed her bed against the wall and laid her down dead center, surrounding her by pillows. She’d be up to sit near her soon and read, given that fact that Sherlock had sent her date running off, tail between his legs and hair standing on end. How he deduced the man didn’t want to get involved with a ready made family, she’d never know and, frankly, didn’t want to, she only wanted to know why he used it to trick him and scare him off,On her way back down, she slipped off her heels to abandon them and slipped on a jumper, the flat was a bit chilly.“Now, Sherlock Holmes,” She grumbled, gently shutting the sitting room door behind her. “Tell me, what the hell are you on about?”“He wasn’t a good match.” Sherlock explained, simply, not looking up from his computer screen. “Better luck next time. You’ll have to trust me on this.”“You’re so full of crap, who on earth do you think you are?” She stomped away from him and poured herself a cup of tea from the still hot electric kettle.“I don’t expect you to understand my reasoning for anything.” His neglect to meet her eyes was driving her mad and she beginning to see red. “You’ll just have to trust me.”“Sherlock, my father’s dead and you look nothing like him.” Finally, he fidgeted in the chair and cleared his throat, eyes still transfixed on the computer screen. Over come, Molly approached and slammed the laptop closed. “Look at me! What in blazes is more important than what we’re talking about right now? Do I bore you?” She demanded, unable to control her frustration with him anymore and he shuddered as he met the full force of her glare. “In what world is your behavior appropriate?”  After licking his lips, Sherlock took a tentative breath and leaned back, speaking softly.“You just seem to have a thing for idiots.” He attempted to explain.“That’s not your place. Don’t you ever –”“Christ, Molly, just because I’ll never be good enough for you does not mean that it’s fair to be or yourself to parade these uni flunk outs and smelly footballers though our flat!” He shouted, affronted by her irritation.“Smelly? What your damned homeless network?!” She bit back. “We have indoor plumbing, why not offer it up instead of simply wrinkling your nose at them?”“I’m not sure I can tell the difference anymore between your dates and my new applicants, or else I might!”“Oh, really, Sherlock Holmes?!”“Yes, really!”“For someone so smart, you can be so dumb.” She gasped, setting down her mug of tea and running her fingers through her hair. “You’re the one who thinks you’re not good enough. I never said that. I asked you out a dozen times and you turned me away each and every time.” Fiercely, she pointed her finger at him.“What could I possibly offer you?” He asked, carefully, standing and stepping into her space. “I’m married to my work and buried up to my waist in it, I’m cold, I’m distant and I’m not very kind at all.” As he rambled on, Molly began laughing, overcome with the ridiculousness of the conversation. “What?”“Nothing. We just sound like a soap opera.” It took a moment for it to register with him, but the moment it did, he lapsed into giggles as well. “You know you’re wrong, right?” She smiled, raising her eyebrows, quizzically.“Of course. Knew it was wrong as I did it.” He shrugged, sheepishly meeting her eyes again.“Then, why did you really do it?” She asked.“Because I like you here… in our home… and, well,” His shoulders heaved up and down as he breathed a heavy sigh. “John leaving was harder than I thought it would be.”“I see.” She nodded, understanding, before a cheeky grin spread across her lips. “You love me.”“I never said that.” He insisted, shaking his head as he returned to his seat before the laptop, again.“You didn’t have to.” She explained, picking her tea back up and bringing it to her lips. “I deduced it.”“You deduced nothing.” Sherlock scoffed.“Oh, really. Well, I bet you if I kissed you, you won’t get hard.” Obviously startled, Sherlock looked up at her, mouth agap. “Well? What’s wrong? Are you chicken?”She inquired, folding her arms underneath, in order to flap them like a bird and cluck.“I’m not scared. Its that… an erection is simply a physical response to that kind of stimulation, so, I may very well achieve one if you were to press your lips against mine.” Sherlock tried to explain.“Ok.” She squeaked, taking another sip of tea and shrugging her shoulders.“Stop it.”“Stop what?” With a wink, she turned away, prepared to walk back upstairs and sit with Sheryl.“For god sakes,” Her smile deepened as she heard him step closer up behind her. “Fine. Have at it.” He insisted, closing his eyes and throwing his arms down at his side.“Have a what?” It wasn’t very easy for her to play innocent when faced with this rare opportunity.“The stipulation was that you kiss me, now, go on.” Molly laughed as she set her tea on the end table by John’s former chair and she grabbed his face. This was a bet Sherlock, happily, lost, right before being left to his devices as Molly slipped upstairs to sit with Sheryl.",A Collection of One Shots,10485

That's what he had, and that what kept him alive. He'd been banned from the villages and anywhere a human lived. The wolves kept their distance, but left a distinct scent marking where he could not cross. He was very much lucky to have been transported to an area surrounded by deer. He was on the hunt when something caught his attention. He stood up straight and inhaled deeply. His eyes widened at the scent. A werewolf-- over the line?

You shouldn't be away from your pack in the first place.""AThe boy whimpered and desperately tried to pull the arm enclosing him off. ""I-I mean no harm in intruding!"" he said. He whimpered even louder when the vampire's nose skimmed the length of his neck, inhaling deeply.A""You smell like a female in heat,"" he growled. ""And is that fear I smell--yes it is. What is it that you have come here for, pup?""A""I-I-I came to learn...of what really happened of Sherlock Holmes...""AHn, to learn of what really happened? Interesting. He released the pup, turned the boy around to look at him. His heart was beating fast in his chest, tanned skin flushed red with fear. Blue eyes were wide and innocent looking--and truthful. But this pup was not worth his life. He turned away from the pup and waved him off.A""Leave. You are not worth risking my life. I've lived in peace here for three hundred years, undisturbed.""AThe boy took a small step forward. ""I simply wish to learn...""ASherlock quickly turned around to press long slender fingers against the boy's forehead. ""You listen to me, pup. You turn around and follow your scent home. There are vampires out there that do not have to follow the line. They may cross as they please, and they will not hesitate to kill a young werewolf like you.""A""I refuse.""ASherlock scanned his face, the fear he'd once had gone. God, Sherlock was losing his touch. It was getting dark, and he knew it was about time for the other vampires to come out. He narrowed his eyes and sighed. Suppose if he protects the pup, his life will not end.A""Follow. You'll stay the night, seeing as you have wasted precious daylight trying to find me.""ASherlock abruptly turned and began the walk back to his little cottage in the middle of a clearing. The pup struggled to keep up with his long strides and all too soon, the tall vampire was no longer in sight. The boy stopped, looked around, but he still did not see the vampire. Several sets of footsteps made his ear twitch, and his fight or flight instincts kicked in. But he was in unfamiliar territory. Then those footsteps disappeared. He forced himself to keep moving forward. He was a sitting (standing) duck if he just stayed in place. With night quickly approaching, he sniffed the air. He sorted the scents out: deer, pine, vampire, vampire, vampire, blood, vampire, and vampire.A""What are you doing, pup, I said you were to stay the night.""AThe boy jumped, and Sherlock clicked his tongue. ""You need not to learn of me, but how to hone in all of your senses, because you would be dead."" This time, Sherlock grabbed a hold of the pup by the back of his neck, pushing him forward. ""Pick up the pace, pick up the pace.""A""John. My name is John.""A""I don't care at this moment. Move your arse.""AJohn was nearly running compared to the vampires long steps. They reached a clearing in minutes. Sherlock didn't let go of John's neck until he put one foot inside the cottage. Sherlock closed the door and locked it, glancing out the window before light up candles.A""You've run away,"" Sherlock said, lighting up a kerosene lamp.  ""At the worse possible timing. You've yet to learn how to shift and defend yourself."" He turned towards John, only to find the pup rubbing himself on his small couch. ""Hey, hey, hey!"" he snapped. ""Stop rubbing your hormone riddled body on my couch. I don't want you scenting my furniture while you're here."" Sherlock went to small bookshelf, fingers brushing across the oak wood before grabbing a thick, leather book, held close by an elastic band. He tossed it to John. ""You want to learn all about Sherlock Holmes? Here. Take it with you. I've no use of it.""AJohn caught the book. It smelled old, very old. It was kept in pristine condition. The spine showed signs of being frequently opened. He slipped the elastic band off and placed it on the small wooden table beside the couch. It took John's eyes a couple of minutes to adjust to the lighting, as the vampire was constantly adding more light around him. He opened up the book to a random page in the beginning. He brushed his fingers over the paper.A""This is written in Latin,"" John said. ""Latin isn't taught in the pack anymore.""ASherlock scoffed. ""Of course not. Latin is a dead language. No one knows the language save for archeologists and those still alive from the time period.""A""How old are you?""A""Old,"" Sherlock said simply, dismissing that conversation.AJohn dropped the subject and skimmed through the pages. What seemed like hundreds of pages later, he came to a section in English dated June 3, 1700. John's skin prickled at the date. It was 2015 now. He turned back to the first page. He skimmed the top and he frowned. He couldn't make since of the lines on the first page.A""What is this?"" he murmured to himself, tilting his head.A""It's a diary,"" Sherlock said, taking to the chair across from John. He picked up a case, opened it. He took out a violin, plucking its strings with a long finger. ""Very, very, very  old. Take it to one of the elders in your pack. They may be able to translate what is in Latin. As for the first few hundred pages. It's a very old language. I don't recall which it is. There are many I've deleted, seeing as they are no longer important to me since I no longer travel."" Sherlock slid his bow across the strings, filling the small area with a soft chord progression that was soothing.AJohn settled in against the couch, toeing off his shoes and socks as he listened to the vampire play. There was something strange about the man. Surely this was not the very same vampire that would surely die if he stepped foot outside of his barrier? He was taught that this Sherlock Holmes slaughtered an entire village for fun, killed off an entire pack of wolves for fun, and another thirty because he'd starved himself in the wake of his killing over three hundred years ago. This man seemed calm, but cold hearted. And he played the violin like a master. He hadn't realized he'd stopped playing until he found himself pinned to couch, the vampire on top of him. He gasped and tried to curl into himself, so hide somewhat. Sherlock's nose skimmed along his neck. John found himself willing tilting his head back in a sign of submission to the man.A""Do you normally submit to strangers?"" the brunette asked, amused.A""I submit to those older and wiser than me,"" John said nervously.ASherlock chuckled, just a soft breath across his neck that made him shiver. And then he was standing, covering his nose. ""Damn, your scent is just...strong. A pup your age shouldn't smell this strong unless--"" John had taken to rubbing himself against the couch again, Sherlock sighing softly. It took him a minute to realized that John wasn't just scenting the couch, but claiming it. Sherlock settled down on his knees, breathing in John's musky scent. ""So very innocent....I'll make a deal with you. I'll help you with shifting as long as you don't turn on me.""A""Deal. Can you teach me about the ways of a vampire?"" he asked in return, sitting up. Sherlock was trailing up along his thigh.A""I can,"" Sherlock muttered. ""What do you wish to start with?""AJohn shuddered, as that long form stood and sat beside him, looking him over with sharp eyes. He crossed a long leg over his knee as he waited for an answer. ""I'm not sure where to start.""A""Vampires...we mate for life,"" Sherlock said casually. ""When a male vampire mates, a chemical is released and, upon being bitten, the chemical is injected into his mate. The mark will never go away and his often left on the shoulder. It's not limited, naturally, but that is the most intimate spot to be bitten. Vampires themselves don't reproduce, so very rarely does a vampire mate with another vampire. Vampires mating with a werewolf is even more uncommon but certainly possible.""AJohn looked up at Sherlock when he said this, straightening up as a hand caressed his thigh. A low rumble erupted from the man's throat. It wasn't quite a growl, but it was an arousing sound. A lightly blush tainted John's cheeks.A""However, a wolf doesn't mate for life. That's what you're taught, but it isn't true. I've been around for quite a long time. A werewolf mates for life...until that mate is either killed or dies of natural causes. After a while, he or she will find a new mate. But..""A""But?""ASherlock nodded. ""Back to a vampire mating with a wolf. If that happens, the wolf is absolutely mated for life. If the wolf's vampire dies, that's it. He or she will be rejected to even try to court someone with in the pack. It's just how nature takes it's course.""AJohn shifted closer to Sherlock. ""Why'd you mention mating first?""A""Mm? I thought it might interest you. Vampires and werewolves are natural enemies. There are certain instincts that are triggered by mere scent alone..."" Sherlock inhaled deeply once again. ""For instance, you crossing into my territory. My first instinct was to kill, but then again, I'd like to see how long I can live so I just simply followed your scent angrily.""AJohn found himself stretched out on the couch, the vampire above him once again. Again, John showed off his tanned neck. ""Is a vampire's bite poisonous?""A""Not in the slightest, not unless the mind is set to kill."" Sherlock's lips were mouthing at the soft skin, closing his eyes. ""Mm, it's been a long time since I've tasted a werewolf's blood, and you did distract me from hunting lunch..."" His tongue darted out lapping along a nice vein. ""Tilt your head back for a bit more--ah, yes, that's it. Right there. Hold still,"" he murmured, holding John's head in the desired position that exposed his neck perfectly for their position. He sank his fangs into that lovely vein. John whimpered beneath him. Sherlock shushed him and drank hungrily. He pulled away before his could drain the boy. He took enough blood from that the boy was a bit off, but a good shake of the head and he was fine. Sherlock lapped at the blood dripping from the wound before running the flat of his tongue across the open area, sealing the wound shut for it to heal without leaving a scar.AThe brunette stood then, stepping out of his shoes by the door. ""Come to bed with me. I don't own another blanket to bring to the couch you have claimed as your own.""AJohn hurriedly followed Sherlock through the small cottage. The inside was much larger than it appeared on the outside. Sherlock's bedroom was very large. It was probably most of the little home. John watched from the doorway as Sherlock began to strip, starting with the deep purple shirt he wore. The pup licked his lips as he eyed the pale skin being exposed before him. He shivered when the trousers were joining a pile of clothes in the corner of the room.  The room itself smelled of oak and a mix of something...something John couldn't describe. It was sweet and very much tantalizing. His mouth watered at the smell. The room smelled entirely of Sherlock. It was overwhelming. He stripped down to his pants as well, looking at the queen sized bed in the center of the room. The comforter was white, a beautiful contrast against the red pillows and mahogany bedposts.ASherlock climbed up on the bed, long, lanky body disappearing underneath the sheets and comforter. John joined him, hesitantly settling on one side of the bed. He rolled onto his side, back to Sherlock. The pup was suddenly feeling very unsure of current situation. He was lying a bed with the most dangerous vampire in history. Said vampire pressed against him. His gut was telling him to run, gather his clothes and run, but his body relaxed into shape of the vampire. Sherlock was inhaling his scent.A""Are you mated?"" John asked quietly.AThere was a long pause, and John stiffed when he was pushed on his stomach. ""No. Not yet, John. So young....I should be ashamed of myself. I've seem to have gotten addicted to your scent. My body is reacting to it. Musky, woodsy. Your blood is so sweet and perfect. I must have you as my own.""AJohn's blush went up to his ears. ""S-Sherlock. I-I'm too young. It's against pack rules--""ASherlock's mouth was at his ear. ""It may be against pack rules, but is it against nature's?"" He inhaled his scent. ""Your body is in overdrive. I smell it."" He nosed his shoulder and flipped him onto his back. ""Look at me and tell me you don't want it.""AJohn chewed on his bottom lip. He damn well couldn't do it, because Sherlock was right. His body was in overdrive. He was of age to mate. A low rumble came from deep within his own throat, nose bumping against Sherlock's face. He inhaled the vampire's sweet scent.A""This addiction will land me in trouble,"" John murmured, looking away.A""Likewise,"" Sherlock agreed.ASherlock rubbed at John's right shoulder, relaxing John. The pup closed his eyes briefly and then opened them, watching as Sherlock licked his fangs. The werewolf noticed a set of nice lower fangs. He tilted his head curiously, but then Sherlock was mouthing at his shoulder. Two sets of fangs then plunged into his shoulder. John cried out, hand reaching out for Sherlock's shoulder, long nails clawing at the pale shoulder. He began to whimper as those powerful jaws locked down tighter. When Sherlock pulled away, John's eyes were watering. Sherlock thumbed away a tear. His lower fangs were no longer visible, and his mouth was bloody.AJohn's shoulder began to burn. It was very much unbearable. He clutched at his should, rocking a bit. ""B-burns!""ASherlock gathered the pup in his arms, lapping up excess blood that spilled. ""Shush, my love. It's the chemical taking effect. It'll stop soon. John whimpered and curled up against Sherlock as the vampire licked the wound. Ten minutes later the burn was gone and what was left what the feeling of being owned and a scar. Sherlock began to rub against John instantly, mixing their scents. Sherlock smelled heavily of John and John smelled heavily of Sherlock.  ""You'll be a lovely mother,"" Sherlock purred, pulling the pup into his arms and resting his forehead against John's. ""When is your birthday?""A""Tomorrow, actually,"" John murmured, nuzzling the vampire's chest.ASherlock clicked his tongue. ""I've a fridge full of deer meat,"" he said. ""I'll have to see what I can cook for you in the morning.""A""Burger sounds nice...""ASherlock chuckled and held the pup--he's mate--close, stroking through his short dirty blonde hair. ""Yes, my love. Whatever you desire.""",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

So a werewolf wondering into his hunting grounds should warn him. Sherlock knew the pup would cause him nothing but trouble before allowed the young John to follow him back to his home.","John awoke to the mixed smell of meat cooking and Sherlock. He buried his face in his mate's pillow and inhaled deeply, shivering lightly in bliss. Slowly he sat up in the bed, running his fingers through his hair. It stuck up in random directions. He rubbed his eyes before getting out of bed. Sherlock's purple dress shirt still lay on the floor and picked it up, shrugging it on. He buttoned it up as he staggered down the short hallway. He followed nose through the sitting room and to a small kitchen just on the other side. The vampire was humming as he cooked. He was dressed in nothing but a pair of trousers.A""Morning,"" he said. He picked up a plate. ""I had someone run and bring me a few things,"" he said, putting John's breakfast with a hum. ""Lettuce, tomato? Ketchup, mustard?""A""Mhm,"" John yawned, stretching. In the corner of the kitchen was a small table just big enough for maybe two. A mug of tea sat steaming on the table. ""Is this for me?"" he asked curiously, sitting down.A""It is,"" Sherlock said, bringing the plate to John. He dropped a kiss on his forehead. ""Happy birthday, my love.""AJohn made a low rumble of content as Sherlock sat beside him, watching him eat. John was going to ask him if he was going to eat, but shook the question from his head. Vampires don't eat people food. Sherlock sniffed the air around John, a small smile appearing on his full, pink lips.A""You're body's getting ready to go in heat,"" he said casually, licking his lips.AJohn frowned, licking ketchup from the corner of his mouth. ""This early?""A""It's only natural. I say you have a few days before you're in heat, in which I would prefer you be with me when it starts...""AThe pup tilted his head. ""Can't I stay here?""ASherlock lowered his head, steepling his fingers beneath his chin. ""It is not advised. Your pack is looking for you, I'm sure. I don't want them to find you over the line. It's dangerous for both of us.""A""But, Sherlock. Why would it matter? They'll know I was here because our scents are so heavily mixed.""A""Tell them I gave you shelter to protect you from other vampires in the area. Take the diary and whatever you do, don't mention you are mated. Alright?""AJohn slowly nodded, finishing off his deer burger. He sipped on his tea while Sherlock took his plate and set it on the counter. ""Can I stay....? For one more night?""ASherlock nodded. ""Of course, my love. One more night shouldn't hurt."" He looked up at the blonde. ""Would like another?"" The blonde shook his head. Sherlock put the rest of the deer burgers he made in the fridge. ""You're welcome to more when you're hungry.""AThe pup finished off his tea and followed the brunette back to the bedroom. He climbed up into the bed and pulled the comforter up to his shoulder. Sherlock chuckled and slid back into the bed as well. He pulled John against him, one hand making quick work of the buttons the shirt the pup was wearing. It was pushed off his shoulders, John sitting up to pull it off completely, dropping it on the floor. Sherlock shed his pants and pressed flush against his young mate. John shuddered and nuzzled the vampire's chest. He tilted his head up, hoping Sherlock understood what he wanted. The feel of soft lips on his made him sigh. Sherlock took control of the kiss, holding John's head in his hands as he deepened it. The pup released a small mewl and parted his lips, the vampire eagerly plundering John's inexperienced mouth.AHe'd rendered the pup breathless. He hummed as John caught his breath and regained his curious look he was sure he didn't know he'd taken on.A""Is a werewolf's bite deadly? Minus the whole ripping apart,"" John asked once his breathing was steady, mouthing at the base of Sherlock's neck.ASherlock took a slow, shuddering breath, running his fingers up and down the pup's back. ""No, not in the slightest, minus the whole ripping apart. If one is not a fan of being bitten, it's most certainly not pleasurable."" He lifted John's head, squeezing his jaw lightly. The pup understood what he wanted and opened his mouth. Sherlock ran his thumb carefully over both sets of sharp canines the wolf possessed. ""You've just gotten your canines, my love. They are still very sharp and deadly, so you need to be carefully."" He placed a hand on the back of John's head, guiding him to his right should. A low continent hum came from his mouth  as his tongue darted out to like the soft pale skin.AJohn was well aware that he was going break skin as soon as he added pressure. He opened his mouth and very carefully bit down on the soft flesh. Sherlock grunted and jolted a bit, but the constant running of fingers through his hair and small noise was a sign that Sherlock was enjoying being bitten. He bit a little harder and the vampire actually moaned. A hand was gently rubbing at his thigh. The grip in his hair tightened as he added more and more pressure, testing his limit before the vampire told him enough.ABut said vampire was moaning and writhing beneath him. He lapped at the blood the was flowing into his mouth. He dislodged his mouth from Sherlock's shoulder. He lapped at the blood around the wound, fingering the rapidly bruising area. He looked up into the vampire's wide misty blue eyesA""I take it you like biting?"" John pushed Sherlock flat on his back, straddling the brunette. He place his hands on his chest and grinned, happy to have made his mate react like that.A""Indeed. It's been so long,"" he said simply, shifting further down into the bed.AJohn licked blood from his mouth, blue eyes shifting constantly. Sherlock reached up to cup the pups face. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. ""Oh. Oh my,"" he purred. ""It seems the chemical has worked too well on you. Must be because you're so young."" Sherlock inhaled again and licked his lips. ""You'll attract males from miles away smelling so strong,"" he chuckled.AThe pup whimpered. ""T-this is my first heat cycle. D-don't laugh at me!""A""Apologies, my love. I just wasn't expecting it so soon.""AThe poor pup was so nervous. Sherlock rolled over so the hormone riddled wolf was on his back, looking up at him. The brunette tucked long thumbs into the waistband of John's pants, easing them down. Sherlock's quick, ever studying eyes. John was a big boy for his age, but taking in his height and weight, it was well proportionate to the rest of his body. He placed gentle kisses along John's neck, tongue darting out lick a long wet trail down to his chest. The pup shivered, rubbing himself against his mate. The pup's body was over sensitive, keening loudly as the vampire stroked his long tongue across his right nipple. He arched into his mouth, moaning as he sucked on it while his thumb rubbed the other. John rutted up against Sherlock wantonly.A""Sherlock..."" John whimpered, feeling Sherlock's pants clad lower half rub tantalizingly against his own lower half. ""Please, please, please, please, please, please, please for the love of God, stop teasing me. I'm needy.""ASherlock chuckled kissed down that tanned body, lifted up John's hips.  He ran his tongue along the length of John's cock, lapping at the pool of precum on his belly. The pup whined. He gave him gentle nips along his shaft before pushing the plump head past his lips and sucking him with ease. The fact that he was currently being deepthroated a very skilled vampire turned him on and had him jumping in Sherlock's mouth. He hadn't noticed the long fingers the was coating itself in the natural lube John was creating until it pushed into the pup. John gasped at the sensations he was feeling. Sherlock worked that long finger in and out him and that wonderful mouth was sucking him down at the same time.A""Ngh! Sherlock!""ASherlock hummed, causing John to buck into his mouth. The brunette made quick, but thorough work of opening up the pup, the small whines and moans of pleasure John made going straight to his own cock. The pup was writing beneath the vampire, legs splayed open, and a thin layer of sweat covered that beautiful tanned body. He shed his pants, something the blonde werewolf was very happy to see.AAnd very frightening at the same time.AHe was young, very inexperienced, and honestly scared to bits, but Sherlock's firm hand on his face and long, relaxing licks across the bondmark on his shoulder eased his nerves. The vampire was surprisingly gentle when handling him. Once he was fully relaxed, Sherlock took the pup's relaxed body and pulled him closer. He gave subtle thrusts inside until he was seated to the hilt in his young mate, shuddering at simply how tight his bondmate was. It's been far too long since he's had the pleasure of experiencing such intimacy that he nearly wanted to rush ahead of himself and completely shatter the innocence this pup held.ABut that innocence was better to be slowly picked apart. John clawed at Sherlock's biceps, biting his lower lip. Sherlock closed his eyes and willed the urge to pound the pup senseless to kindly fuck off. He didn't move until those sharp nails were no longer digging painfully into his arm. He started with slow, shallow thrusts that would make John gasp and give a soft moan. And then those thrusts became deeper, drawing long moans from both species. The werewolf began to keep up  and understand that rhythm was his best friend. Each thrust in, John lifted his hips, each pull out, he would lower them. Sherlock knew he'd hit home when the young werewolf howled and grabbed on tight to him.A""T-there, S-Sherlock! Please!"" he cried, hands locking around the brunette's neck. ""Please, harder! Faster!""AThe feeling of those sharp nails leaving scratches deep enough to bleed made the vampire growl, gathering the pup's head in his hands and kissing with enough force that his lips would be bruised, his hips responding to John's demand on their own, driving the younger into oblivion.  A few good tugs on his cock had the blond tightening nearly painfully around the brunette as he came all over himself, face flushed and his body an absolute wreck. The shear tightness of John's body had Sherlock tumbling over the edge, sharp hips jerking through his orgasm.AJohn panted beneath Sherlock as the man collapsed on top of him, not even bothering pulling out. He probably couldn't even if he tried, he'd worn his body out, and the mix of pheromones and hormones in his bedroom were intoxicating. He laid his head on John's shoulder, short but thick shaking fingers combing through his sweat damp curls. Eventually, Sherlock found the strength to ease out, lying next to his young mate.A""I do hope your body takes to my seed,"" the vampire murmured, rubbing idle circles on John's belly. ""Our pups would be beautiful and clever. Very dashing.""AJohn nuzzled the brunette. ""We have a full twenty-four hours to tell, Sherlock,"" he mummed, putting a hand on top of John's be fore lacing their fingers together  and settling closer.AIt may be broad daylight now, but a nice nap was in order. It was sure to be dark by the time they awaken again.A ",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

So a werewolf wondering into his hunting grounds should warn him. Sherlock knew the pup would cause him nothing but trouble before allowed the young John to follow him back to his home.","John ended up stay one more extra day, the day spent with Sherlock teaching a (happily pregnant) John how to shift. John didn't question his knowledge. Within half a day, the blonde was a large sandy colored wolf. John lowered his head and Sherlock nuzzled the great beast, scratching behind his ears. The pup trotted around, ran around and just acted goofy as he got used to being on all fours. The back half of the day was spent with John trying to return to his human form, which was a lot harder than John would imagine. Afterwards, though, sitting naked under the moonlight, panting heavily from the hard work, he grinned. Sherlock rolled his sleeves up, smiling proudly at his mate.With inhuman speed, he was straddling the blonde, pushing his head back gently. John understood and held his head poised for Sherlock. The vampire ran his thumb along the smooth neck, tongue licking his fangs. He leaned down on his lover, sinking his fangs into a good vein. John gripped at Sherlock's shirt. It was a strange feeling. It was as if he could feel his life leaving his body, but he trusted Sherlock not to kill him by accident. Sherlock didn't take much from him, and he lapped at excess before licking the wound, watching it heal and disappear all together. John licked Sherlock's lips and fangs clean. The wolf made short work for the first few buttons on Sherlock's shirt, sinking his canines into the vampire's shoulder.Their moment of intimacy was short lived as a howl caught both of their attention. Both panicked. John quickly dressed. The vampire's instinct was to protect his pregnant mate at all cost, but also the known fact that it was John's pack--the same pack that had banned him to a small area-- made his brain turn from KillKillKillKill to simply protect your mate. The pup whimpered and pressed close to Sherlock.""The Alpha is here, Sherlock,"" John's said with raising fear.Sherlock pressed his lips into a thin line, fingers combing through John's soft curls. When the wolves appeared, Sherlock stiffened and tightened his arms around John. The large creatures circled them, blocking off any route to escape. The vampire growled protectively, burying his face in John's silky blonde hair, the pup clinging to him. The Alpha shifted along with two others-- John's parents, Sherlock assumed.""John,"" the Alpha said with a note of concern. ""Are you alright? Has this---this monster  hurt you?""John whined and lowered his head, still clinging onto his mate. ""No. I'm well.""John's parents tore their son off the vampire and another growl, more towards a snarl. The Alpha came face to face with Sherlock. ""What are you doing with one of my pups?""""He wondered out, looking for me. It was near dark and there are others out there who would love to kill a young pup, so I took him in. He's well fed. Deer meat. He is unharmed. I swear to you, the pup is unharmed.""The Alpha took it upon himself to examine John. His nose crinkled and a snarl left his lips. Of course, if Sherlock could clearly smell that John was pregnant, than so could the other wolves. John's shirt was torn off. The three gasped.""You dare mate with my son!?"" growled his father, as the Alpha's fingers prodded the wound on his shoulder, the wound showing he belonged to the elder vampire.Sherlock went on defense as there were collective growls around him. John's own growl joined in and that took the vampire by surprise. A look of brief hurt crossed his eyes, but he realized it wasn't directed towards him, but towards the members of his pack. John shoved his father away, standing on his own.""You've broken pack rules, Sherlock Holmes!"" the Alpha yelled. ""Name them!""""Illegal mating with a werewolf, mating with a werewolf underage, along with impregnating him, and kidnapping of a pup,"" Sherlock said calming, lowering himself, and accepting what was to happen.The Alpha nodded towards a couple of the wolves. ""Take John home. I want a few of you to stay here. You'll await for your trial, Sherlock Holmes.""""There's no need. I know my fate for the laws I have broken. I have lived a very long, and very bored life here. I've no need to drag it on any longer.""""Very well then. I'll allow one last hunt, because I'm not a complete monster unlike yourself.""""Please. That was three hundred years ago. How was your pack even sure I was still alive here?""John was nosed forward, but he stood there, looking at Sherlock down on his knees in front of the Alpha. Sherlock gave John as slow, taunt smile. ""See you soon, my love. Take good care of my pup.""The blonde was nosed again and this time, he allowed himself to move forward with the four wolves escorting him home. He heard the sounds of a deer, and he stilled respectfully, allowing Sherlock to have his last meal. He simply listened. He sat there in the middle of the woods, the wolves urging him on and whining in frustration when he just sat there. Sherlock had helped train him to hone in his senses, though he wasn't the best. He could pick up on the soft footsteps of the vampire closing in on the deer. Forward, forward, towards where he should not cross. John continued on, eyes searching  for the brunette. The sound of the other wolves running told him that they weren't even going to give Sherlock to pleasure of a last meal. The deep baritone rumble that would resemble a scream if the vampire wasn't so big on pride filled his ears along with snarling.John didn't want to be in the woods anymore. He mustered up the energy and he shifted with little regard of his clothes. Long claws dug into the earth and he propelled himself forward, weaving in between the trees. He left his 'babysitters' in the dust, following the scent of the Alpha back towards the Den....A Ten Months Later.... AJohn was more or less on his own when it came to his pregnancy. His sister was supportive the most while his parents were disappointed he was actually going to keep the 'monstrosity' growing inside him. Harry kept watch over his baby boy while he went out on patrol with the adults. John was still very much a pup at age sixteen in the eye of the adults, but seeing as he as managed to shift, he was forced to join patrol every few days.John hadn't forgotten about Sherlock. There was no way he could. He'd look in the mirror every morning and caress that mark on his shoulder. John's fur prickled on the back of his neck. He had a feeling he was being watched, but it didn't alert him. It was like someone familiar was watching. John broke away from the back, trekking into what had been Sherlock's hunting ground before his 'trial'. He trotted up to the cottage in the middle of the clearing. The grass was overgrown around the small building. He shifted to his human form and put a hand on the door. He inhaled deeply. The area still smelled heavily of his mate, and he allowed his thoughts to briefly wonder into the sadness he felt in his heart. The sound of grass crunching off in the distance caught his attention. No one ever crossed the area. He sniffed the area and stiffened. That scent was oddly familiar. It was Sherlock. Much more distinct than the area. He heard the soft whisper of a chuckle and felt a hand push him into the door.""Hello, my love. It is so nice to see you again,"" came a low baritone that couldn't be mistaken for anyone else in the world, he turned around and threw his arms around the vampire, biting back the squeal he wanted so badly to release.""How the hell?"" he demanded, inhaling the rich scent of Sherlock. ""Where the hell?""Sherlock chuckled again. ""It wasn't hard to fake my own death, John. Simply put in someone who looks like me, switch clothes and a few other tricks I've picked up over my life time. As where I've been...I've been tracking down a pack-- a special pack made up of werewolves, vampires and a human. John, after I found it, I came straight back. I didn't expect you to be on patrol at this age."" Sherlock shook his head. ""Beside the point. I wanted to take you back, and join that pack."" John's mouth twitched into a smile. ""Did our pup survive?"" he asked, realizing he'd gotten far ahead of himself.John nodded. ""Yes. It's a healthy boy.""""What's his name?"" the vampire asked in an excited breath.John carded his fingers through soft brunette hair. ""Maddox. Harry just keeps calling him Blaze. I don't fully understand why, but it seems that's going to be his nickname. He's responding to it--more or less. He's only a month old.""Sherlock caressed John's cheek. ""Do you think you can get him out of the Den? I'd like to see my son.""John nodded. ""I'll do more than that, Sherlock. I'll go with you, Sherlock. Tonight?""""Tonight. Meet me here, my love?""The pup agreed and Sherlock pulled him into a bruising kiss before disappearing. John shifted back into his wolf form and quickly caught up to the rest of the pack as if he never strayed off. He returned to his son and sister. He was grinning when he picked up Maddox.""What's got you in a chipper mood?"" Harry asked, tilting her head.John leaned in to whisper, ""He's back, Harry. I ran into him in the woods."" He looked down at Maddox, who was pulling on his bare nipple vigorously, the blonde wincing. ""He faked his death, and he's found a pack more...more...""""Accepting to the strange?""""Yeah, we can go with that.""""Let me guess. You're running away for the pack.""John sighed sadly. He'd hate to leave his sister, but... ""No one really...welcomes us. We're out of place and no longer belong...""""Don't worry. I understand. I'll even help you sneak Blaze (Maddox, Harry!) out of the Den.""""Thank you, Harry. That means so much to me.""""Then pack your bags, brother. I have just the distraction..""(-_-)John was sure Harry was going to be in some deep shit for fighting, but it had the entire pack's attention away from the direction he was headed. He fed Maddox as he quickly and quietly entered the woods. From there, he put the bottle in the bag and settled his son in his arms, and then, it was a full on sprint to their rendezvous place. He stayed aware of his surroundings as his eyes adjusted to the pitch black of night. He sighed when the clearing was in sight and Sherlock stood closer to edge of the woods, waiting.John slowed to a walk, panting. Sherlock approached him, kissed his forehead, and then, with the most gentle and utmost care, took the pup form John's arms, cradling the infant. The sound of howling made the infant cry and Sherlock bounced him lightly, shushing him, smoothing back the mess of dark brown locks on his head.""We'd better run,"" John said. He shrugged off a bag of things for Maddox and handed it to Sherlock, who simply but the strap over his neck. The brunette took off a drawstring bag. He shed his clothes, Sherlock smirking lightly at the sight of his mate and took that bag as well.""Let's run,"" Sherlock said, briefly intertwining his fingers with John. He took a few steps back as John shifted.John lowered his large head, digging his claws into the soft earth. He flung himself forward, easily keeping up with the vampire as they ran to the nearest town. John found himself thrilled as he ran beside his mate as they began to retrace Sherlock's steps to a pack where they could start their new lives....",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

He's done bad things in his long life. He's trapped, in an area just large enough to actually hunt for game. One foot outside the trap and he's dead. So a werewolf wondering into his hunting grounds should warn him. Sherlock knew the pup would cause him nothing but trouble before allowed the young John to follow him back to his home.","John was a little surprised at just how well he'd fit in with the new pack. Within a three day time period, he, his pup, and his mate were moved into a nice flat free of charge by the Alpha-- Gregory. The flat had been empty for a while, but well cleaned for the move in. Even Sherlock's older brother (whom he hadn't met yet, but according to Sherlock, it wouldn't be too long until the elder Holmes showed up) had the entire flat carpeted and baby proofed it. He laid his giggling pup on the clean carpet and let him be, finding it entertaining to watch the young hybrid try to roll over. Sherlock took a seat in John's lap, feet up on the coffee table.""What do you think, my love?"" Sherlock asked, fingers combing through John's dirty blonde hair.John shivered, leaning into those long fingers. ""I never thought I'd end up in London. It's...relatively pleasant here. You don't get the luxury of peace like in the countryside, but it's nice...""""There's a but,"" Sherlock said, scooping up Maddox and laying him in his lap, fingers lightly pinching at his baby fat, the pup giggling. A small smile appeared across the vampire's face at the bubbly sound.""I can't help but to feel nervous to met the entire pack. I mean, I'm thankful, but, you know...Ties.""Sherlock kissed his forehead. ""I understand, John. It's probably even worse because of your upcoming heat cycle.""John groaned and threw his head back. ""Don't remind me."" He closed his eyes briefly before looking down at the boy in Sherlock's lap. ""He's got your curls.""""And he has your darker blue eyes.""John carded his fingers through Maddox's curls. ""He's got the stomach of a wolf, I'll tell you that. He can really put down a bottle.""""What've you been feeding him?"" Sherlock asked, bringing his son up onto his chest when the infant yawned.""It's been a mixture of milk and blood. The formula makes him sick, so then we tried the blood and that alone made him sick. Harry mixed the two and he's been fine with that.""""Will probably have to ween him off animal blood since we're in the city. It's much easier to come across healthy human blood.""John looked at Sherlock with a raised eyebrow. ""As long as no one ends up dead.""Sherlock scoffed, carefully cradling Maddox in his arms as he got up. He swayed around the room, humming a soft tune. He came to a stop when Maddox snored lightly in his arms. He mumbled 'precious' under his breath before taking the pup to his own room and putting him in his crib. He was silent when he came back down the stairs. John stood so the vampire could stretch out on the couch. The pup settled on the brunette's waist and laid down, nuzzling Sherlock's neck.""Open for me, my love,"" Sherlock said, lifting John's head. He pressed gently against John's bottom jaw. He opened his mouth, Sherlock studying John's canines. They were still razor sharp, and he ran his thumb haphazardly over them, nicking his thumb. He then swiped his bleeding thumb over John's bottom lip, the werewolf darting his tongue out lap it up.""Sharing blood is a serious intimate action,"" Sherlock said as John's lips enclosed his thumb and sucked lightly on it.John made a small sound in the back of his throat. He looked up into gorgeous blue eyes, letting the pale thumb slip from between his lips, lapping lightly before he arched his neck, looking down at Sherlock expectantly. John was well aware at how intimate sharing blood was. It was studied briefly during his school days. Sherlock easily flipped their positions and quickly sank his awaiting fangs into his neck.""Ngh!"" John groaned out, but he had come to love the feeling of Sherlock drinking from him.Sherlock closed his eyes, humming softly. The pup tapped the vampire's chin lightly when he began to feel light headed, but Sherlock would always push a little longer, a good five seconds longer before he pulled away. John blinked as he tried to focus his eyes on the brunette.""Git,"" John said, pulling him down to kiss him, to taste his blood on his tongue, and he found that it mixed very well with the vampire's unique taste.Sherlock chuckled, thumbs rubbing along John's strong neck. He was about to lean down for another kiss when Maddox began to cry. John made a soft whine in the back of his throat, about to push Sherlock away so he could get up and check on the infant, but Sherlock shook his head. ""No, no. I'll check on him, my love.""""Thank you, Sherlock.""Sherlock stood and walked quietly up the stairs. His enhanced sense of smell caught the scent of a dirt diaper. He crinkled his nose and pushed the door open. He tsked as he picked up the infant. He carried him to the changing table, cleaned him up and replaced the dirty diaper with a clean one. He tossed it away into the kitchen trash can by the table. Once he opened that, the scent of lemons engulfed him and he groaned. With his son in his arms once again, he carried him downstairs where John was, still sprawled on the couch, now on his stomach, looking over a piece of paper. Sherlock settled Maddox on the carpet. The pup gurgled and babbled on, kicking in an attempt to roll over. The vampire straddled the werewolf's lower back, looking over his shoulder.""What is this, John?"" he asked as observant eyes darted quickly over the paper.John sighed softly. ""A grocery list.""""All of this is meat,"" Sherlock said, one long finger skimming along the paper as read.John nodded. ""I'm still a pup, Sherlock. I do require a heavy meat diet. A large part of this has to be raw."" He tapped the pen against his forehead. ""I've lost a lot of weight after having Maddox. I need to gain that weight back in order to stay healthy."" He looked back at the vampire. ""Healthy me equals healthy blood which equals--""""A sweet, rich surprise during our most....intimate of moments...."" He grinned, nosing John's neck.There was a knock on the door, Sherlock swiftly getting up to answer it. Sherlock studied over the man at the door, recognizing him as Gregory. He stepped aside. ""Come in,"" he said, lowering his head in respect. There were others with him, and upon meeting one of them, there was already a personality clash, but the vampire held himself in check. Two females, one a werewolf, the other a vampire, entered in after Gregory. After them was one more male-- the one Sherlock already didn't like.""Settled in yet?"" Gregory asked, looking around and noting changes. He kneeled down pick up the pup, who had extended his arms. He nuzzled the infant, giving him the attention he wanted. He smiled at the blue eyed baby. ""Hullo, little one. It's nice to meet you,"" he cooed, bouncing him lightly. Maddox giggled and clapped. ""Welcome to the pack, little one."" When Maddox began to squeal and kick is when he put him down on his stomach, the boy trying to lift his head to see what was going on, but eventually gave up and settled to finish out his nap on the floor. Greg straightened up and turned to John, who instantly shifted into a confident but submissive stance when he stood. He outstretched his hand, Greg studying him a for a moment before he accepted his hand. ""I've enrolled you in home schooling, staring from materials learned in sixth year. I'm all too familiar with the ways of your blood pack."" He scowled down at the floor.Sherlock cleared his throat lightly, motioning for Greg to take a step back. Maddox was fast asleep by his foot. The vampire picked up the pup and carried him back to his room. Greg watched him go with a small smile.""Are you hunted?"" Greg asked with a tilt of your head.John lifted and dropped his shoulder. ""I wasn't accepted anymore. Mum and Dad left me to fend for myself and my son. My older sister stepped in and helped me raise him for the a month....Then Sherlock came back, and now here we are.""Greg invaded his personal space, sniffing the pup. ""You're still a pup by old law,"" he said, tsking. ""We'll have to get you accustomed to new pack rules... As for the infamous Sherlock Holmes,"" he looked up the stairs. ""No killing an entire city. Rob the blood bank in town, if anything.""There will come a time when we will all take to the outskirts of London, near the boarder. We'll let loose and hunt as a pack of three. Seeing as vampires are primarily solo hunters. They indulge mostly on animal blood, which I'm fine with. That's less paperwork I gotta do when someone finds a body.""Sherlock seemed to appear at John's side, the pup not really used to it. He jumped when he felt an arm wrap around his waist. ""Maddox requires little human blood for now. I want to wean him off the animal blood.""Greg raised his eyebrow. ""Isn't that his mother's choice in what he is fed? Whatever he chooses to feed him is what he will be fed.""John looked up at Sherlock. ""I do want to mix animal blood with his formula, just be cause it respects the animal more. Remember, you drink the blood, I eat the meat. Let's not waist the animal.""Sherlock crinkled his nose, slightly embarrassed that he was put on the spot like that. He nodded his head towards the rest of the group, who had remained quiet.""Oh, let me introduce you to the rest of the pack."" He motion to small woman with bouncy, curly hair and sassy stance. ""This is Sally Donovan. Sassy. Keep your distance. She bites. Hybrid."" She bared her teeth at the two, but in a joking manner. He motioned to taller, slimmer brunette, who smiled at them. ""Molly Hooper. Very nice. Works in the morgue of all places. Werewolf. Soon to be in heat. My mate. Keep your motherfucking distance."" Molly blushed and hid behind the man. He motioned to the next person to step up. ""Anderson. First name, Unknown. Vampire. Old bastard. Not very bright, however. Very stroppy most of the time."" He motioned to himself. ""Gregory Lestrade. Detective Inspector. Alpha. Put yourself in your place amongst the pack. Don't make me put you there.""John nodded. Sherlock cleared his throat, smiling softly. ""Sherlock Holmes. Vampire. Much, much, much older than you,"" he said, pointed at Anderson. "" 'Killed' ten months ago. Father.""All the attention was turned to John, who shrank some under the scrutiny of his new back. ""John Watson. Sixteen. Werewolf. Mother.""Greg clapped his hands together. ""Now that everyone knows each other. We'll take our leave. I'll be back, however, in a week or two to talk to you and introduce you into our pack life. Sherlock, I can probably find you a job....The human, Mrs. Hudson can watch Maddox while you're gone and while you're being tutored, John.""John nodded. This time Greg held out his hand, John taking it. They shook hands and then once again, Greg was in John's personal space. He brought his hand to his mouth, lips parting to reveal two sets of canines that were coming to a point. He bit down hard, John yelping as he wasn't expecting that. Clearly, neither was Sherlock, because his first instinct was to growl, which Greg simply ignored and quieting him with a reassuring glance of dark eyes. He broke skin, lapping at the little drops of blood that he caused. He pulled away to allow the pup to wipe his hand on his jeans. John raised his brow, pouting.""That was so I can find you. Just a little blood so I can contact you telepathically if I needed too. I'll be testing it out later on,"" he said in a warning tone. ""We'll see you later. Take care of yourselves. Be nice to Mrs. Hudson. She's a lovely woman, just a bit overbearing at times when she's worried.""With that four of them exited the flat, leaving Sherlock and John standing in the living room, feeling a bit giddy, now after being formally accepted into the back without any if, ands, buts, or rejection from the other three. John sprawled back on the couch, knocking his list onto the floor.""That was utterly exhausting,"" John said, yawning.Sherlock wedged himself in between John and the back of the couch. ""I don't see why, but rest, John. You've been wide awake for forty-eight hours. I'll take care of Maddox, shall he wake during your nap.""""Mm, I love you, Sherlock.""""As I you, my love.""",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

So a werewolf wondering into his hunting grounds should warn him. Sherlock knew the pup would cause him nothing but trouble before allowed the young John to follow him back to his home.","John and Sherlock were finally getting into the swing of things. It had been three weeks since Greg had came to visit and meet John. The blonde had been wide open those entire three weeks. For majority of the day, he stayed in the empty flat below his own with his tutor, learning things he would have in a public school. After that he'd stop by and pick up Maddox from Mrs. Hudson's flat next door. He was starting to wean the pup off animal blood, seeing as he was no longer drinking his formula. He was two months old, still drinking formula, but it was now being mixed with Mummy's blood instead. The infant was laying in the floor in the kitchen sucking happily away at a pacifier. John picked up one of the many very sharp knives in the kitchen, and he cut into the palm of his hand, grunting as he flexed his hand every so often.Sherlock strutted into their flat, tossing his coat onto the coat rack by the door. ""Hello, my loves,"" he said, walking into the kitchen. He stepped over Maddox, the boy giggling and reaching up to try and catch his pant leg. He stood behind John, long arms grasping the counter top on either side of the werewolf, pinning him there.John turned his head to kiss him, turning his palm up right. He pressed his lips against Sherlock's briefly before turning back to what he was doing. ""Hello, darling.""""What's this?""""Maddox isn't drinking his formula. I assume it has something to do with the animal blood honestly, so I'm trying something different.""""Mm,"" Sherlock hummed, staring at the steady drip of blood.""I was counting on you to be home when I did this,"" John said, holding his bloody hand out to Sherlock. ""Will you close that?""""Most certainly, my love,"" he said.Sherlock took John by the wrist. He first started to lap up all the blood from the webbing between his fingers, long pink tongue stroking delicately across the warm flesh as John single handedly twisted on the top of the bottle and putting the cap on to shake it up.  He couldn't help the moan the slipped between his lips as that nimble tongue circled around each digit, sucking, teasing him. Sherlock took his time as he savor the sweet taste of John. He swiped his tongue slowly across the cut, the wound healing instantly. He continued to lap and suck until his palm was blood free.""Thank you, darling,"" John said, reaching down to pick up the infant. Maddox whined kicking. John tightened his hold on the pup. ""What, you want Daddy to feed you, you spoiled thing?"" he questioned, tilting his head.Sherlock smiled. ""May I?""John rolled his eyes, handing the pup over to his father. He gave him the bottle. Sherlock frowned as he studied the nipple. It had small holes in it.""Oh, yeah. His canines just pushed through his gums today,"" John said casually, leaning against the counter to snack on a sandwich he had made before he fixed Maddox's bottle. ""Mrs. Hudson nicked her finger over one.""Sherlock used his thumb to gently pry the pup's mouth open. Sure enough, his top canines were starting to poke through his gums. ""Interesting. At only two months?""John nodded. ""I wasn't expecting them until later on in the month. My canines didn't come until I was about two months. Give or take a few days.""""Canines are the first to develop.""""Mhm. Once the canines come in, the rest of the teeth fill in. It's weird, but that's just how it works. The rest of the teeth don't push through until a couple of months later. They're sharp, sharper than mine.""Sherlock wrestled with the infant to get his thumb back. He'd taken to chewing and sucking on the soft flesh. He chuckled and smiled at his son as he examined his slobbery thumb. He'd punctured it a couple of places, but it wasn't that big of a deal. He gave him his bottle and hummed softly as he drank. John went into the sitting room, stretching out on the couch.""How are you studies coming along, John?"" Sherlock asked, smoothing down Maddox's hair, the pup looking up at him wide, dark blue eyes.""They're coming,"" John replied, curving his back, hissing quietly when it popped. Oh, now that was better. ""I've a test coming up. I've studied for it before making his bottle. I plan to look over notes before bed.""Sherlock went to the couch, John lifting his legs so Sherlock could sit. Once Maddox finished his bottle, he burped him and laid him on John's chest. The infant yawned and laid his head down, wiggling until he was comfortable and settle for a nap. John put one leg on the floor, Sherlock sitting the bottle down and crawling up on top of the wolf as well. Maddox yawned cutely once again and settling, with some help by Sherlock, with his back to Sherlock's chest, gripping John's shirt, almost like he was trying to use it as a blanket. Sherlock draped his arm across his boys, nuzzling his head into John's shoulder, as their son began to snore softly. John mused his curls before inhaling sharply, his hand rubbing at his stomach.""Ngh...."" John turned his head as he rubbed his stomach.  That unfamiliar, but unforgettable warmth spread throughout his body. Sherlock inhaled deeply, moaning softly.John was in heat.(-_-)John wasn't sure how he felt in this situation. He, Sherlock and Maddox crammed into the back seat of Greg's car. The atmosphere was tense, the trapped air smelling of nothing but hormones. Molly was in the passenger's seat shifting uncomfortably. Maybe it was because of her heat, or maybe it was the tension. It was natural, two werewolves and their mates being highly protective of their wolves.""Goodness, calm down now,"" Mrs. Hudson scolded, looking more towards Greg than Sherlock. ""There's so much tension even I  can feel it."" She settle back in her seat, smoothing down Maddox's hair. He gurgled and pulled on her skirt, the old woman humming softly. She turned her attention to Sherlock, the she didn't look at him while she spoke, the vampire still knew she was addressing him. ""I don't know much about history of England and such,  are you the very same  Sherlock Holmes that slaughtered all those villages long ago?""Sherlock nodded. ""The very same.""The woman simply tsked. He look down when Maddox pulled on his pant leg. He used that as leverag and pulled himself into Sherloxk's lap.  John's hand wondered over to his leg as well, resting on his thigh. Soon, they arrived in front of a rather large house. Mrs. Hudson was the first out of the car. She stretched and groaned as joints protested against the movement. Sherlock got out after John, the pup shouldering the backpack they had for Maddox's things. John studied the house, sniffing lightly. Past the hormones that both he and Molly were giving off, there was a strong scent of both vampires and werewolves. The perimeter smelled heavily of Greg, letting any creature know that they were trespassing on his territory. John still didn't quite feel like he belong, and the scent sent a shiver down his spine. Sherlock put a comforting hand on his shoulder, urging him to follow Greg and Molly.""This is a rendezvous point for us. It's important you know how to get back here.""Sally and Anderson were sitting on top of  picnic table when they walked around the house. There was a large expanse of back yard before it became woods. It was fenced in, the gate that opened up to the woods just a few feet from the first row of trees.""Look who it is!"" Sally said, sliding off the old wooden table. ""It's the killer and his wolf.""""Please refrain from calling me that,"" Sherlock said, lightly bouncing Maddox in his arms. ""At least, in the presence of my son.""Greg mused the infant's hair. ""Yes. Let's not let him grow up hearing his father being called a killer. He doesn't need that.""""Well--""""Shut up, Anderson. We don't need any platitudes,"" Greg muttered.Mrs. Hudson took Maddox from Sherlock and his backpack from John. She sat down on the bench while the Alpha addressed the rest of his strange pack. ""We're doing a joint hunting trip today. We help each other,"" he said as he stripped off his jacket, folding it neatly and setting it on the table. His shirt and tie came off next. ""Nobody fights over a kill.""""I figure you would need these,"" Sally said to Sherlock and John, tossing the vampire an empty, clean milk jug and a knife. ""For the kid,"" she said, nodding towards Mrs. Hudson and Maddox.Greg was working open his pants when he spoke again. ""There are people who hunt us out there, though they shouldn't be this far north.""Molly grabbed John by his hand and pulled him to where he and Greg were standing. Sherlock took that as he cue to join up with Anderson and Sally. John was slightly uncomfortable when Molly shrugged off her shirt, but he decided to get over it and pulled his up over his head. He folded it and sat in a separate pile for Greg's and Molly's. Both Molly and Greg stared down at John, eyes darting directly to his stomach. The pup turned a light shade of red, biting his lips to hold back the whine that built up his throat. They were staring at the scar on his stomach from his C-section. He turned slightly to avoid their stares as he took his pants and boxers off and neatly folded them and put them on top of his folded shirt.""Please don't stare at it,"" John murmured, hands covering the scar.Molly smiled softly. ""Sorry, John,"" she said, touching his forehead. ""Just never seen--""John shrugged and rolled his shoulders, relaxing slightly as the other two wolves became naked. Shoes went on the bench beside Mrs. Hudson, tsked as she gathered the clothes. The blonde stretched, loosening himself up much like Greg and Molly did.""How many times have you shifted, John?"" Molly asked.""I want to say....five, maybe more, maybe less. It's not many. I tried to take time away from patrol in order to care for Maddox so my older sister could get her required hours in."" He tilted his head.""At age sixteen, I wouldn't expect you to be able to shift, let alone go on patrol with the pack. Hunting?""""Was never allowed to go. I couldn't during pregnancy, and even after. I was too weak to hunt when they put me on patrol. Even then, I was sent off by myself in a direction. I wasn't well liked in my pack afterwards. Kept to myself. Just me, Harry, and Maddox, really.""Greg gripped John's shoulder, a small smile playing across his gentle but stern features. ""Well, you don't have to worry about that. You're accepted into this pack, whether they (Anderson) like it or not (Anderson). When I first met Sherlock, my instant thought was to, ya know, kill because he did  wipe out an entire pack of wolves, and I'm a highly protective alpha, but when he mentioned his pregnant werewolf mate and the rather desperate plead for acceptance, it wasn't hard."" He nodded towards the woods. ""Come on, John. We'll need to teach you how to hunt with the pack, and get the milk jug filled for your boy.""The six of them filed out of the fence, Greg closing it behind him. The Alpha was the first to shift. He made it seem so easy, as did Molly. John took the longest. Once in wolf form though, he stretched out his limbs and shook his large head. Greg circled around him, John naturally lowering his head, but the large, grey wolf simply pushed his head up with his muzzle.Head up, lad, came the calm voice. As long as you know your place within the pack, there is no need to show your submission. You're a large wolf for your age. Look arrogant, kid. John sat down, lifted his head a little high, puffed out his chest a little more. A rumbled came from the Alpha's throat, approval.AThat's it!  ASherlock chuckled as looked at his mate. While the act looked childish, an act of defiance in a way, it also looked very menacing, giving John a few extra inches in height when sitting, made him look larger. Greg continued his inspection of John.You're relatively healthy. A little under weight, but I assume that's from pregnancy. You're fit enough to hunt. Greg's stern voice turned from John to Sally. Come one, ye lazy thing. Sally crossed her arms. ""Just because I didn't want to shift doesn't mean I'm lazy, thank you very much. It puts our numbers even.""Greg led the way into the woods. This was also something John needed to learn how to do, and the Alpha planned on making this hunting experience as educational and thrilling as he could possibly make it.(-_-)Alright. It could have been worse, John decided as he limped back to the gate. He could have been dead. He couldn't shift back into his human form, even if he had to. It was too painful. There had been hunters in the woods. John whined painfully. He'd been shot three times, twice in his right shoulder, once in hunch. Greg had been shot, too, in the shoulder. He'd shifted someone where close to the tree line, stumbling out into the open. Sally, Molly, and Anderson had darted off after the hunters that shot their Alpha and new packmate. ""I can see the bullet,"" Sherlock said as he forced John to sit down beside John, who had taken to lying on his left side. ""Hold still.""""I swear to God don't you dare--fuck!"" Sherlock pushed his finger into the bullet hole, digging out said item. Greg howled and gripped Sherlock's wrist, but when the silver bullet dropped from in between his fingers onto the ground, he let his wrist go. ""Ow!""""Shush, please, Gregory. It's not too bad."" To avoid actually having to put his tongue to the Alpha's skin, he swiped his thumb over his tongue towards the back. He smeared his saliva over the bullet hole, watching as it slowly closed up.Greg  whimpered as he rolled his shoulder, going over to kneel by John. John whined as he his shoulder was touched, leg twitching. ""Oh, John. I'm terribly sorry your first hunt didn't go too well.""AI'm....I'm fine. I should have sensed them close by. It's partly my fault.AGreg pushed sandy colored fur, stained red with blood, from the wound. ""Sherlock, come work your magic. These are deeper."" Sherlock kneeled in front of John, fingers combing through his matted fur. He tsked. He couldn't see the bullet.""Gregory, please hold him down. I don't want him squirming too much or I might hurt him even more.""The grey haired man nodded. He rolled his injured shoulder a few times before he shifted back into his wolf form. He placed a large paw on the pup's head, using his full body weight to keep John down. He was nearly the same size as Greg, but the Alpha had years more of experience, knew how to keep the pup down. Sherlock began to dig for one bullet. John yelped and naturally tried to jerk away, but Greg put pressure on his head, growling low.AStay down, John. Don't  move.ASherlock's free hand was petting behind his ear. He managed to get the first bullet out in a short amount of time. That second bullet is what gave him trouble, be he eventually got that one out as well, his mate writhing.""Good new, my love,"" Sherlock said as he studied his hunch. ""This was just a graze. Can you shift back?""The wolf huffed as he was let up. Greg went through the shift with him, encouraging him to fight through the pain. Both he and Greg were a bloody mess, John laughing a bit when he completed the shift.""Ugh, fuck me,"" John murmured to himself, Sherlock gripping him, going down to first stroke his tongue over the wound on his hip, standing to lick the wounds in his shoulder. Molly, Anderson, and Sally came back. Molly shifted and stretched. The three that returned were blood soaked, and neither of the other half was going to question what happened.""Here,"" Sally said, handing Sherlock the milk container full of blood. ""It's a mix of human and animal blood. See if he'll drink that."" Sherlock took the container. He nodded his thanks.""Let's get cleaned up. Someone go get Mrs. Hudson,"" Greg said. ""It's bath time.""""What are we, four?"" Anderson questioned, stretching. ""I don't appreciate it being called 'bath time'.""""Essentially, that's what it is though,"" Greg said. He turned to John, seeing as it didn't really apply to Sherlock today. ""There's a small kiddie pool over there. This is one of the old lady's contributions to the pack. Just go with it, or she'll man handle you into the pool and it isn't pleasant.""(-_-)John sat down on the large couch, bottle in one hand, his son in the other. Molly shyly say beside him. The pup looked over her with a soft smile. ""Would you like to?"" he asked, offering her the bottle.Her eyes lit up. ""You will?""""I don't have a problem with it,"" he said, handing Maddox to her. He helped her settle the infant into her arms.Molly hummed happily, cooing the hybrid as he greedily drank the bottle. When Greg came into the living room, John gave up his spot beside her, taking to the love seat opposite of the couch where Sherlock was sitting. He curled up by his side. Anderson and Sally sat on the couch facing the telly, Sally's feet in the vampire's lap. John studied them. There was clearly nothing going on between them, but Anderson was smitten by Sally, the curly brunette either ignoring the fact or oblivious to it.Maddox made a happy noise, the Alpha scowling down at the infant as he was being kicked, though he didn't seem too put off by it. ""Oh, you're going to be a trouble maker once you're in school, "" Greg said, running his fingers through the pup's curls. ""I'm curious to see who he'll grow up to look like. He's even mix between you two for now....Sherlock's curls, John's darker blue eyes.""""Certainly John's canines,"" Mrs. Hudson piped in, bringing in a tray of tea.Greg sat up. ""His canines are in?"" he asked, taking the infant out of Molly's arms, the woman scolding her mate. He gently pried open his mouth wide enough to see four very sharp teeth. ""Once the rest of his teeth come in, he'll be ready for meat!""John rolled his eyes at Greg's excitement and picked up a mug of tea. He curled up comfortably against Sherlock once more, sipping at his tea. Greg examined the infant. A knock on the door made him look back. He sat Maddox on the floor. Sherlock got up and picked up his son, returning with the baby in his lap. He grabbed the his bag, fishing out a few of his toys which he spread across his and John's legs. Greg awkwardly rubbed his hands on his thighs. Sherlock tilted his head as he studied the way he shifted from foot to foot, glanced at the door and back to him. Molly looked a bit put off. Anderson and Sally tensed, like they were ready to fight. John was confused. Sherlock, he was doing what he does best.""I assume it's someone I don't particularly care for, with how you keep looking at me. And if it's someone I don't particularly care for, I'd say it's my older brother at the door?""Greg nodded, lowering his head as said vampire entered the room. ""Yeah, also...Ahem....""""Mummyyy!"" came a little girl's voice, the sound of liquid being shook up and containers clacking together in a bag filled the room. A small girl, about three years old, came running into the room, Greg holding out his arms.Greg smiled as the girl ran into his arms. ""Hullo, Angel,"" he said, hugging the girl close.Mycroft strutted in, hands behind his back. Once Greg put the girl down, Mycroft glanced at Molly, who simply nodded to acknowledge his presence. He stepped towards the man, the two brushing their noses against one another. Greg turned to Sherlock, taking an awkward breath.""Your brother is my first mate, and this,"" he pointed towards the girl who was running to hug Molly, ""is my daughter, his daughter. Angel, aren't you going to introduce yourself?""The little girl huffed and threw her bag down, Mycroft scolding her lightly. She went to the coffee table, Mrs. Hudson picking up the tray as she stood up on the table. ""My name is Angela Elaine Holmes. I'm four--""""No, you're not,"" Greg said teasingly.She huffed again. ""I'm gonna be four in four,"" she held up three fingers, ""weeks! Mummy calls me Angel 'cause he wants to. All my one friend calls me Angel 'cause it short for Angela. Daddy says I have this uncle named William and he said it was time for to meets him so I chose the prettiest dress I own!""Greg smiled a bit as said vampire smiled a bit too. Sherlock passed Maddox along, who seem intrigued by Angel. ""I believe it is your lucky day, Angel,"" Sherlock said slowly. ""I just so happen to be this Uncle William of yours."" He lifted the little girl into his lap. ""Though why he said William beats me. Just call me Sherlock.""She reached up to tug on his curls. ""What's you're whole name then, Uncle Sherwock?""""Sher-lock. Not wock, lock."" Angel giggled. ""William Sherlock Scott Holmes. That's my full name, Angel.""""How old are you?""""Old.""Angel turned her attention to John. ""What's his whole entire name?""John shrugged. ""Maddox. He doesn't have a full name."" He looked at Sherlock, who gave him a questioning look. The blonde was serious.  ""It's just Maddox.""The infant looked up when his name was said, dropping the plastic keys he had in his mouth. Angel climbed out of Sherlock's lap and went back to Greg. ""Mummy, he doesn't have a full name! We have to give him one! We have to, we have to, we have to!"" she exclaimed as the Alpha picked her up.Greg smoothed down her hair. ""Well, sweetie, that's not really our place to say. It's all up to Sherlock and John. They're his parents. They get to decide.""John chuckled and put Maddox on the floor. Angel sniffed and pushed him back. ""Yuck! You smell weird!""Greg handed her back to Mycroft. ""It's not me. It's our dear Molly back here that smells weird!""Molly gasped and threw a pillow at Greg. ""You're horrible!""""It's not just you, Molly,"" Sherlock said casually. ""It's John as well.""""Git! Don't bring me into this!""Everyone in the room laughed. Mycroft put Angel down. ""I'm afraid I must be off. I can only stand so much.""""Oh, that is so  not what you said three years ago!"" Greg exclaimed, pushing the vampire out of the house, slamming the door behind him.Everyone looked back at Greg, who sighed and combed his fingers through his hair. Sherlock studied Greg before he got up. Angel shrugged off what happen apparently used to seeing things like this happen. Molly scooped down and picked up the three year old, carrying her off, the two of them giggling. Sherlock approached Greg, inhaling deeply, jumping back, tripping over the table and landing on his arse beside it, eyes wide. He shook his head, as if to clear his mind, but really, it was to get that smell out of his nose.""Jesus fuck!"" Sherlock exclaimed. ""I've never, in the thousands of years I've been alive, have ever, came across an Alpha wolf that smelled so strong!  You smell stronger than a bloody teenage female going through her first heat! Bloody hell!""The vampire made his way back to his mate, buried his nose in John's neck, inhaled the scent of his second heat, anything to get the scent of an Alpha in heat. John tilted his head back for Sherlock, lips curled up into a small smile. Anderson looked at Sherlock with amusement, while Sally rolled his eyes.""Oh, get over it. It's not that bad. Sure, it's pretty strong, but don't be so dramatic over it,"" Sally said.""It bloody well is that bad!""""John's not phase by it,"" she pointed out.The pup raised his eyebrow in agreement. The scent had no affect on him. He was mated for life and could care less about the Alpha being in heat. He had a mate...or mates. Whichever and what ever was going between Greg, Molly, and Mycroft.Greg rolled his eyes. ""This house. Anderson calls it a breeding ground.""""Oh, because it is, though. I've yet to see one pup come from it--""""When one of us is in heat, we all  come here. It started off with Molly about to be in heat. Mine is off by month for God knows what reason.""John began to put away Maddox's toys. ""Mine is a week off, but on time I guess you would say. This is my second heat.""Greg snapped his head to look at John, forgetting this small fact. John was still young. He could only imagine how the pup was really feeling in room full of hormones and his mate obviously so antsy beside him, uncomfortable. He nodded to a set of stairs. ""Follow me. Choose a bedroom to mark as yours.""(-_-)The room was small, cozy, John though, but big enough to have queen sized bed and still have room for a crib (which said would be going into Mrs. Hudson's room for various reasons that weren't too hard to figure out). John's body twitched. This was his bed, his  pillows. His, his, his. He began the task of scenting the piece of furniture, body rubbing against the mattress in a way that made Sherlock shudder as he watched him. He should have stopped him from scenting the whole  bed, seeing as though John claimed it as his and they were going to share it. Maddox was in Mrs. Hudson's care for the remainder of the time they were to be in this 'breeding ground'.""I swear if you growl at me when I get in...""The vampire shrugged off his shirt and his trousers, long form stretching. The night had crept up much faster than usual, and Sherlock found himself tired, tired from the hunt, tired from being around so many people at one, just tired. But oh good God  as soon as he laid down in bed, he was enveloped in the scent of his lover, his mate in heat. Oh, it was tempting, as he rolled over to face his young lover. He inhaled that sweet scent, bringing the pup closer, legs tangling together, John's breathing hitching.Sherlock's thumbs slid along John's cheeks. Even in the darkness of the room, his enhanced eyesight allowed him to see those beautiful pink lips part. He pushed his slender thumb into John's mouth, brushing across those four sharp teeth he still possessed. John's soft pink tongue darted to lick the invading digit, pulling it further into his mouth to suck on it. His mouth was innocent around his thumb, tongue giving little kitten licks to it, almost like he was shy, but his body, Jesus his body  was rubbing against Sherlock, scenting him, marking him as his. The vampire reached back with his free hand, grabbing at John's delectable arse, squeezing it.John looked up at that sharp face he loved so much. He moaned softly around Sherlock's thumb, taking it all the way in, bobbing just slightly. He was no longer give those skittish little kitten lick, but wrapping it around his thumb, stroking, fully licking him. It made the vampire groan. Sherlock's cock had very much come to life. There was nowhere he could escape John's raging hormones, not that he would want to. He shamelessly pressed his erection against John's hips, rutting carefully against him. He could probably get off like this, rutting against his mate while his thumb was seductively sucked.John groaned around Sherlock's slender thumb. ""Ngh, Sherlock,"" he whimpered softly. ""God, Sherlock I need you in me, but I-I want to-- Ngh-ah!""Sherlock had bit down into his shoulder on the bondmark, fangs piercing his skin. His shoulder exploded with a warmth. It could have been the blood flowing into the vampire's mouth, but John was oh-so confident that it was the chemical released that created that bondmark. It was as if he could feel the bond strengthen. He found Sherlock's weight on his waist, his rolling against his, and the pup responded with the rolling of his own hips once he found rhythm.The pup's vision was going blurry, couldn't see his mate, but he could feel his weight shift to his chest, felt something twitch against his bottom lip. His instinct was to open his mouth and so he did. The vampire dragged long fingers up John's neck, up to grip the headboard to help balance himself. A little shift from the werewolf beneath him, and his throbbing cock was enveloped his warm, wet heat.""Careful, my love,"" he said in a whisper, couldn't manage anything else, not with the way John was licking at the head. ""Don't let your canines into the equation.""John was careful. He worked Sherlock's thickness into his mouth, tongue lapping at him on each upward bob of his head. His eyes closed, enjoying the feel of that large cock dribbling on his tongue, twitching because of his actions. He took him even deeper, lifting himself up more. It was hard for him, but he wanted to impress him. He kept going until he felt his cock hit the back of his throat. He choked on him, but swallowed around him anyways. The blonde was gagging around him, and Jesus fuck  did it feel good. Sherlock pulled back, unable to hold back any longer. He jerked the wolf back flat against the bed, removed those lubricant-soaked red pants he loved so much. Legs spread for Sherlock, John let out a soft, needy whine ready for his mate. The vampire made quick, thorough and careful work of opening the younger. John's moans filled the room, joined by the soft squelching his fingers made inside of him. Sherlock eased his digits out, replacing them with the plump head of his twitching, eager cock. Their fingers intertwined together above John's head, Sherlock's long body laying on that small, compact body. With a slow and powerful roll of his hips, the vampire seated fully inside that body, that warm, willing body, pliant under his touch. John's back would have arched, but the weight of his lover kept him pinned to the bed. He lifted his hips, lowered them, rocked against that man devoted to taking him to the heavens. Sherlock began to move inside that tight warmth, cock stroking back inside him. John wrapped his legs around the slender form above him.Each stroke into his body was long, hard, made John's body shake and shiver with pleasure. John broke his hands free of Sherlock's grip, moved them to his back, scratched, clawed, nails biting into soft, pale skin.A""SherlockSherlockSherlock! Faster!""AJohn was shameless as he begged Sherlock faster, the vampire complying willingly. He sat up more, placing his hands on his shoulder, pulling the blonde into each one of his deep thrusts. John's face was screwed up in pure, unfiltered pleasure, toes curling, legs tightening around him.""Oh ssshhiii--Sh'lock! Fuck, I can't-- I can't hold--So close!"" John whimpered. His nails dug into Sherlock's skin, gripped tight as his orgasm rapidly built in his belly.""Don't hold back, my love. I want to feel you shudder around me as you climax,"" Sherlock growled, voice dropping from deep baritone to grumbling bass, making the pup shudder.John growled and bit Sherlock's shoulder freely as he spilled over his and Sherlock's chest.Sherlock growled, pushing the pup's legs back. One, two, three more thrusts and the vampire was filling John up. John collapsed on the bed, growling when Sherlock tried to pull out. Sherlock understood, and without pulling out, he managed to roll them both on their sides, Sherlock the big spoon to John's little spoon. The vampire ran his fingers through the mess on John's stomach, the muscles twitching beneath his feather light touch. He brought the hand to the pup's mouth, his tongue darting out to lick the fingers clean.""God...I love you, Sherlock,"" John groaned, Sherlock lightly rolling his hips. ""And I love you.""Sherlock's arms formed a protective cage around his mate. He eased himself out of John, ignoring the growl and the light feeling of his teeth on his arm. ""Oh, hush you. I'll get you a plug sooner or later.""John let out a soft noise from within his throat, sounded like he  thought the idea good, wiggled back against Sherlock to settle for sleep. He tucked his head under Sherlock's chin, tangling their fingers together, drifting off into a comfortable sleep.(-_-)The entire house woke up to Angel stomping through the kitchen downstairs, Maddox screaming like he'd been shot. John and Greg were the first two people downstairs, both half dressed in pajama pants.""What the bloody hell is going on down here?"" Greg demanded, rubbing sleep from his eyes.""Why can't Daddy come and eat with us?"" the little girl demanded, stomping her foot down.Mrs. Hudson was trying to shush Maddox but the boy wasn't having it. John gently took the boy, curled him against his chest, bounced him lightly.""Daddy has important business to do, sweetie. He can't simply drop everything to come here.""""Is that why he leaves me with Anthea during the day?"" she asked warily. ""I never see my Daddy! I want my Daddy! Give me my Daddy now!""Greg grabbed the girl by her arm. ""Calm it down Angela Elaine,"" he said in a stern voice. ""I can't just wave my hands and make Mycroft Holmes just appear. You know just as well as I do that he'll do whatever you want when he damn well is ready to. Don't you dare ever raise your voice at me again.""""I want my Daddy!"" She stamped her foot down once again.""Corner time. Go stand in the corner, right now. It's too early for all your screaming."" He went to the stove and put the timer on for fifteen minutes. ""You can come out when the time beeps.""She stomped off to her designated corner, arms crossed. She humphed and put her nose in the corner. Greg pinched the bridge of his nose and reached for his mobile. John looked between the Angel and the highly irritated Greg. Maddox was still crying in his arms. The tension in the room was high, and he was sure the infant could feel that.""Anthea, put me through to--He's in a--I don't care. Put him on the fucking phone."" There was a pause. ""Mycroft Holmes. Dinner. Seven on the dot. Your ass better be here on time. Not a minute late, or my bite will most definitely be worse then my bark....I wake up this morning to Angel screaming 'I want my Daddy to eat breakfast with us. I want my Daddy. I never see my Daddy. Give me my Daddy now.' It happens every time she's with me. Every time. I don't care what bullshit excuse you have to make to leave early, but you do it. You do it for your daughter.""With that Greg closed his phone and threw it on the counter, the device sliding across the counter top and landing on the floor. The Alpha didn't bother doing anything about it. He simply shoulder past John and Mrs. Hudson. He stormed up the stairs, John sighing and following him up. Anderson, Sally, and Sherlock had their heads poked out of their rooms as he stormed down the hallway, slamming the door shut to his and Molly's bedroom. John pushed on Sherlock's head, urging him back into the room, Maddox still pitching his own fit.""Shush you,"" John said, climbing into bed. ""You're not having parent issues. I don't want to hear it.""Sherlock climbed back into bed after putting on his pants. Maddox put his thumb in his mouth, sucking away as he rolled over, his back to John, his front to Sherlock. He closed his eyes. Sherlock pulled the comforter up.""Alright, so this pack is a little more complicated than I expected,"" Sherlock said casually, rubbing John's cheek.The pup shrugged. ""It's home now.""They had both closed their eyes when the three of them were startled by Greg's angry. ""Jesus fuck, who the fucking 'ell are you?!""This time, every being in the house went downstairs half dressed in the bare necessities. John gasped and took a step back behind Sherlock, the vampire tightening his hold on his son as a low, predatory growl came from within his gut, warning, threatening. The Alpha of the pack he ran away from stood in the doorway of the large house, John's parents and sister flanking him on both sides. Harry looked so uncomfortable as she shifted from foot to foot. His parents looked concerned, though it had to be fake, the Alpha, downright pissed off.""I've come for my pups,"" the Alpha said. ""I tracked his scent here and I know you've hidden him here!""Greg pinched the bridge of his nose. ""You have no business here in my territory. The pups are mine.""The grey haired Alpha took his stance protectively in front of his pack. The other stepped in a closed the door behind him. Harry made a mad dash to her brother, looking up at the tall me with serious eyes. Sherlock snapped at her instinctively, but, after a quick deduction, realized this is the sister John had mentioned helped him escape the den. Sherlock took his place in front of his mate and sister. Mrs. Hudson, slipped in the back behind John and Harry with Angel. Molly, Sally, and Anderson flanked Greg.""Give me a name,"" Greg said, eyes darting over the man.""Jack.""Greg kept his body language menacing, but he paced towards John, nudged him from behind the protection of his mate. John refused to go anywhere near them. ""This pup is mine,"" Greg snarled, pressing John close to his body. The blonde didn't know how to react at first when that lean body of his new Alpha began to rub against him. After a split second he realized he was scenting John as his, biting down on his bare shoulder to mark  John as his. He could hear Sherlock's low growling, but the sharp look Greg shot back shut him up quick. ""Mine. Maddox and any other pup born to John Watson and Sherlock Holmes is mine.""""Sherlock Holmes?"" snarled Jack. ""You dare protect a monster? One that slaughtered our own kind? What is this you protect?""""This is my pack, my coven. Mine. Each and every one.""John's mother took a step forward, beckoned Harry back. ""Come, Harry. Stay away from that monster!""Sherlock looked down at the woman. ""You are John's blood,"" he said simply. He handed her the infant in his arms, Maddox crying out at the shift, but settled once again.Harry bounced the infant. ""So you're the Sherlock Holmes? John talked about you a lot. Even though it was the typical 'I hate that man for getting me pregnant because agony', he did say you were rather pleasing to the eyes and quite a gentleman. Nice to finally meet you.""""As well,"" Sherlock said, eyes still on John. Greg was still circling around him. Oh, he was going to have to have a serious bath to get the scent off of him.""I want to stay with my little brother,"" she said, looking at John around Sherlock.Greg tsked, taking John back to Sherlock. Greg rubbed against his sister much like he did John, though he was a lot nice and didn't bite her, respect. There was a tension, air tightening, getting ready to snap at a moments notice. Greg had just claimed another member to his pack, stole three right in front of Jack's face, nothing Jack could do, nothing but fight. But Greg was much more possessive, much more protective of his pack--his family-- than Jack could ever be of a single mate. When Gregory Lestrade claimed something, it was his, and his alone. He did not play with the safety of his family. Jack knew this, but it was embarrassing to loose another packmate, but there was a sense of eminent death if they stayed any longer, posed as a death wasn't the same price as two pups and his sister.""John ran away to me,"" Greg said to Jack, hand on the doorknob, twisting and opening the door.""What you do to lure him to you?""Greg didn't answer, simply nodded at Anderson and Sally, who were all too happy to man handle their unwanted guests away. The silver haired man looked at Sherlock. ""Sorry about rubbing against him without asking. John you might want a bath....Actually, I think bath is what everyone needs. I  want everyone bathed and seated at the kitchen table while I start breakfast.""No one argued with the Alpha, and it was a mad dash to the bathrooms, lines forming outside both doors. The promise for a good breakfast was a motivator for his entire pack, even Mrs. Hudson.",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

He's done bad things in his long life. He's trapped, in an area just large enough to actually hunt for game. One foot outside the trap and he's dead. So a werewolf wondering into his hunting grounds should warn him. Sherlock knew the pup would cause him nothing but trouble before allowed the young John to follow him back to his home.","Maddox was throwing the biggest fit John had ever seen a pup throw over a bath. He bent his legs back so the infant could lay on his thighs, body just submerged in warm, soapy water. He wrestled with the infant while Sherlock, sitting on his knees outside of the tub, scrubbed the pup down. Outside, there was a knock on the door--Harry. Sherlock and John rolled their eyes, but they didn't blame her; it had been a while since she's seen her brother, her nephew, and she wanted to get to know Sherlock. Sherlock rinsed Maddox, dried him and wrapped him in the small Ninja Turtle towel Greg had so graciously provided them. He stood and opened the door, handed him to her and closed the door back.He kneeled down beside John, leaning in to inhale, his nose wrinkling as he smelled nothing but the hormone riddled Alpha on his mate's body. Sherlock picked up a clean flannel and soap, John willing himself not to cringe away from those hands that roughly grabbed him, sat him up.""Hey, hey, hey, hey! Be easy with me, Sherlock!"" John whimpered.Sherlock shook his head, as if he had been somewhere else in his head. ""I'm so sorry, my love. The fact that Greg rubbed against you like you were his mate instinctly angers me. You are mine, my love.""""Yours alone, darling,"" John hummed, closing his eyes as the grip on his arm loosened, allowing himself to relax into Sherlock's hand and let him bathe him. He was very, very thorough in bathing the pup. Every inch of skin was clean, rubbed raw, but he felt so calm afterwards. John climbed out of the tub while Sherlock let out the water. He helped his lover dry off and dress, cleaning up their mess as they made their way out, putting the towels and dirty clothes in the clothes hamper that was stationed in the middle of the hallways, seeing as both bathrooms where right there.Downstairs, Angel was running around completely starkers, giggling as Greg chased behind her with a towel. ""Come here you prat!"" he called out. It seemed the entire pack was trying to catch her. John and Sherlock watched.John joined in. He cornered her and scooped her up, putting her on top of his shoulder and carrying her back to Greg. The alpha, now breathless from the chase, nodded in appreciation.""How is it, little girl, that you manage to out run the vampire? You're not supposed to be able to outrun the vampire! Put your clothes on so we can all eat.""""Okay, Mummy!"" She ran off to the living room with Molly.Greg went to the kitchen. A long bar curved around, big enough for the entire family. He set out plates, cups, and forks. He set a large plate of pancakes in the middle beside a plate of bacon and biscuits. Molly sauntered in wearing one of Greg's shirts and long, fuzzy socks.""Morning, boys,"" she yawned, stretching.""Morning,"" John said, eyes naturally darting down to get a look at bright pink panties she had on. Sherlock hit him non too gently and rolled his eyes.John shrugged it off and made his way to the fridge for a glass of milk. The rest of the family made their way downstairs, the bar quickly filling up. Eventually, there was one spot left at the head of the table that was left clear. Mycroft's place. Breakfast was eaten in silence. Sherlock picked at his food while John just simply stared at the brunette.""Are you not going to eat that?"" John asked after clearing his throat.Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ""No,"" he said, his other eyebrow raising as well as John took his plate and began to happily devour another plate of food. ""Are you serious?"" he asked. ""John, you just ate an entire plate of food--where does it all go?""""To the bedroom,"" Molly said casually, grinning around the fork in her mouth. ""A wolf's appetite is very hard to satisfy.""Sherlock crossed his arms on top of the table and leaned forward, quick blue eyes narrowing. He pointed at the woman. ""I've seen two millenniums and I've yet to hear a sentence with more double meaning than that. Congratulations.""""Wait--so how old are you?"" Anderson asked, taking a sip from his tea.Sherlock turned a sharp, questioning glare at the vampire. ""One millennium is one thousand years. Two millennium is--""John swallowed his bite of pancake. ""Two thousand years. The third millennium started in 2001, so I'd say he's well over two thousand years, yes?""Sherlock smiled and pointed towards his mate. ""Precisely. And you, Anderson? How old are you? Judging by your lack of knowledge, I'd say three centuries? Maybe four.""Anderson shrank down in his chair, Sally rolling her eyes and hitting the back of his head. Sherlock rolled his eyes turning to his son when he began to wail and kick in Harry's arms.""Alright, alright,"" she cooed, putting the infant down on the floor. ""You're down, you're down. Prat.""""Prat indeed,"" John hummed, popping a bite of biscuit in his mouth.Maddox rolled around happily, giggling and making spit bubbles. His mother shook his head and chuckled. Greg put his plate in the sink, mused Angel's hair and got on the floor with Maddox. The boy squealed and slowly lifted his head to look up at the Alpha.""You'll be a troublemaker when you grow up, Maddox. I can see it now,"" Greg said, playing with brunette hair. He nosed the pup, then stood, his knees protesting the action. He clapped John on the back, making making the pup choke on bacon. ""Mrs. Hudson, we'll be hunting soon,"" he started, turning his attention to the woman cleaning Angel up.""So soon, dear?"" she questioned, tilting her head. ""It was just yesterday you went hunting.""""I know, but I feel some tension that should be relieved."" He eyed Sherlock and Anderson staring harshly at each other, Sherlock more so.""I don't like him,"".Anderson said without turning his attention away from Sherlock.""The feeling is very much mutual,"" Sherlock stated blatantly.""Behave,"" John muttered.Sherlock turned his attention away from the younger vampire, looked at John and nodded. He lowered his head, John raising his head higher as he steel blue locked on the other, the vampire submitting to the pup as well.Greg's lips parted slightly, curled up in a snarl. John instantly knew the sound was directed towards him before Greg touched his mind.ALower your head, pup.AJohn lowered his head as he was told, sliding into his place within the pack very quickly.AYou're just a pup. Stay in your place.AJohn grew silent, stood and put his plate in the sink and washed it. The entire table, save for Sherlock and Anderson, looked at the boy. Greg continued to watch until he took his seat beside Sherlock. He waited for a moment.""Go on. I'll be there shortly. John, you stay behind.""Anderson, Sherlock, Molly, and Sally put their plates in the sink and went outside. Mrs. Hudson scooping Maddox up and took Angel to the gaming room. John swallowed thickly, sitting back down. He scratched the inside of his thigh awkwardly. He whined softly, head lowered.""John. Know your place. You are not one to inflict your dominance over anyone but your mate, and even then, he is much, much, much,  older than you are. Don't make me have to put you in your place ever again like that. Not unless I put you in charge--which certainly is not going to happen any time soon until you've been in this pack at least a year,"" Greg said. He sat down beside John, who continued to stare forward at the wall. He turned John's chair so he was looking at him. The pup swallowed again. ""Did it just come naturally?""The pup nodded, the Alpha raising an eyebrow. ""All you do is keep your head down in my presence until you learn who is in charges this pack."" John nodded, steel blue eyes darting down towards their feet. Greg pressed his lips into a thin line. Greg nodded towards the door to the back yard. ""Shift. Your hunting with means Anderson.""John quickly got up from the table and made his way outside, stripping along the way to the fence. He folded his clothes and set them beside Harry's, Molly's, and Sally's. He shifted once he reached the fence, fighting through the pain. He sat back on his hunches beside Molly, who nosed him once. John huffed and turned his head. Sherlock walked up to John, scratched behind his large ears, the pup's body naturally relaxing and his tongue lolling out of his mouth as he lowered his head for the vampire to be able to scratch like he wanted him too.Greg finally came out of the house, his daughter latched onto his leg, an exasperated look on his face. He peeled the girl off his leg by removing his trousers. ""Angela Holmes, you can't come with us. You're not big enough yet. You have to be John's age to be able to come.""""How old is he then?!"" the child asked.""Much older than you.""""How old?!""Greg sighed. ""Sixteen, Angel, sixteen.""""You'll be back in time for dinner with Daddy, right?""Greg nodded, musing her hair. She officially let him go with that conformation. She ran back into the house with Mrs. Hudson. Greg stripped off his pants and shifted. He trotted out of the fence, bumped his nose against Molly's muzzle.Look who's shifted , Greg sent telepathically.Sally strutted circles around the Alpha playfully.  Gotta outrun you boys, she taunted.John watched the scene, settling down. His large head tilted as he watched what should have been a challenge. He huffed and put his head down on his large paws. How unfair! Sherlock was busy playing with the fur on top of his head. Molly pawed at him.What's the tension? she asked, sitting on her hunches beside John.John lifted his head. It's nothing, really. Thanks for asking.ADon't get snippy with me, John.ASorry... John lowered his head back onto his paws again.Greg ended up pinning Sally, which was well expected. John heard Sally's laughter ring in his head as he let her up. The Alpha then turned to John. Come on. You want to push your dominance. Let's see you try and pin me, Greg taunted, circling around the pup and his mate.John followed Greg's movements carefully. Im not much a fighter.And you were allowed to patrol with the pack? Greg asked incredulously.I never said they were smart about putting patrol. He sat up, tilting his head.Greg slowed to a stop in front of the sandy colored wolf. How do you expect to become an Alpha if you can't protect your pack, your child, your mate? John didn't answer. No, no, no, you can't go on without basic skills. I won't allow it! I'm going to teach you. Starting today. Greg opened up the link to the rest of his family. I've changed my mind about hunting. I've found more pressing matters to attend to. John...You're staying with me.Greg couldn't blame Sherlock's instinctual growl and shift forward, but Greg was the Alpha and he had to put the elder man in his place among the pack. He raised himself higher, showing his dominance, but the vampire held his ground. John intervened shortly after, sliding his large form between his mate and the Alpha. He motioned for him to go, nosed the lanky form. Sherlock reluctantly followed the rest of the pack, Harry sitting patiently until the vampire stood beside her.And then began a dreadful day of training.(-_-)John was sore. And there was just a mere three hours until Mycroft arrived for dinner. Mrs. Hudson chided Greg for not going easy on the pup. Both males had walked into the kitchen completely starker, covered dirt and mud, and John looked absolutely knackered. The pack was all helping the elder woman with preparing dinner. Sherlock looked up from the garlic he was chopping up, eyes darting over his form for any sign of injury. Deciding there was none to be concerned about, he continued on with chopping. He raked it into a bowl with the knife, putting the cutting board in the sink to be washed.Mrs. Hudson took the bowl from the vampire. ""Thank you, dearie! Go own. I know that look anywhere.""""Thanks, Mrs. Hudson,"" Sherlock said with a breath of relief, dropping a kiss on her forehead.""Just this once!"" she said, chuckling. ""Greg, do wash up and help, will you?""""Of course.""Sherlock walked with John to the bathroom closest to their room, Greg heading in the opposite direction. John dropped his clothes in floor, seeing as they were covered in dirt from him holding them. Sherlock neatly hung his own up, turned on the shower. John stepped in, his lover right behind him. He leaned back into the lean form behind him.""So what was today all about?"" Sherlock asked, arms tightening around him.John looked up into greyish-blue eyes before rolling his own steel blue. ""About me getting my arse kicked back in line,"" he grunted as large hands rested on his hips, squeezed and massaged. Those hands bent him forward, kneaded his back. The pup was horribly tense. ""Oh, that's amazing...Keep rubbing.""Sherlock chuckled, skilled hands loosening up tense muscles. The vampire took good care of his mate. He bathed him, relaxed him fully, letting the small, compact body depend on him for support. He turned off the water and dried him thoroughly, then dried himself. He redressed and wrapped the towel around his tired lover. With his arm around him, John's head lolling on his chest, he lead them back to their bedroom. He tsked as he sat him on the bed. An hour kip wouldn't hurt anyone too bad, he thought as he dressed him in a jeans and a yellow flannel and black sweater vest. He settled him onto his side of the bed carefully. He could barely keep his steel blue eyes open.""Sleep, John. You need it, my love. I'll come and wake you in an hour,"" he murmured, leaning down to kiss his cheek.""Uhhhh....."" came John's noise of acknowledgement.Sherlock went downstairs to finish helping with dinner. The kitchen was a smooth machine, everyone having a part to help with. Maddox was rolling around the kitchen floor, bumped his head on table. Sherlock said, counted to two before the waterworks came. He looked over the island at his son.""Hush up, boy, you're alright,"" he said as the pup continued to cry. Harry gave him a look, but he brushed it off. ""Honestly, he's not going to go far in life if we baby him--See? He's fine."" Maddox rolled over all the way into the work area. Sherlock nudged him with his foot. ""Shoo. Out with you, son!"" He continued to nudge him until the baby got the message and rolled on out.""I gots him!"" Angel cried out, running into the kitchen and trying to pick the pup up.""Angel, put him down. He's fine where he's at,"" Sherlock said.""But Uncle Sherlock!""""Don't 'but' me. Put him down.""Greg placed a few tomatoes in front of Sherlock. ""Where's John?""""Exhausted. He's asleep. He could barely keep his eyes open after a shower.""""Jesus, what did you do?"" Greg demanded, leaning against the counter.Sherlock put extra power behind the knife as he cut a tomato. ""Why do you assume I did something to him, hm? I'm fully aware that I do not have your complete trust. I've been around for a very, very long time, so if you think--thought--you could hide your distrust, throw it away. You can hide nothing from me. I can look into your eyes right now and see exactly why you don't trust me. I've killed, I've slaughtered many, many in which were werewolves. But to think I would do anything that would harm or induce anything unwillingly upon my mate, I can assure you your troubles can well be forgotten about John and my son.""Greg had shrunk down underneath Sherlock's sharp silver gaze as his tongue cut into the deep recesses of his fear. ""I-I-I wasn't assuming--"" he babbled on, definitely not becoming of an Alpha. ""I was just asking--""""Stop. You're making a fool out of yourself."" Sherlock continued to cut tomatoes. ""By the way, all I did was soothe tense muscles.""Greg was a bright shade of red. He pointed his finger at the elder man. ""This is the only time--""""Or what? You'll pin me? Try to get me to show my belly to you? I'll be fair to warn, I'm not one to submit easily. However I do respect my place within your pack, you will have to earn my submission."" Greg nodded. That was better than nothing he supposed. Maddox's cries made the vampire look up. Greg tsked. ""Angela,"" he said, watching the girl try to pick up Maddox. ""Didn't Uncle Sherlock tell you to leave him be?"" She nodded. Greg went to pick Maddox up. ""Then leave him be. Socks. Where are your socks? Go put them on. Daddy should be here soon. Sherlock, go wake John up, please.""Sherlock put his knife down, heading upstairs to get up the sleeping beast. Everyone helped set up the table. They turned to John as he walked down the steps, yawning, Sherlock behind him fixing his clothes much like a mother would. He tucked in his shirt and pulled down his vest, long fingers taming his massive bed head. John's eyes were yet to really open. The vampire guided him through the kitchen. Harry chuckled and passed a mug of hot coffee.""I took the liberty of saving your tired arse,"" she said.""Harry, I love you,"" John said, opening his eyes to look at his sister. He took a sip of coffee and shuddered. Black was not his preference, but he didn't complain. He took his mug and strutted out of the way of busy hands. ""Sorry I missed out on helping with dinner,"" he said as he sipped his coffee.""No worries,"" Greg said. ""You earned your kip. You did well today, John.""Greg glanced at the clock on the stove. 6:59. Mycroft should be knocking right about...now. A knock on the door came, Angel running to open it, Greg right on her tail. The pup threw the large doors open, squealing happily. Mycroft stood there, looking like the posh git he was, before a small, genuine smile spread across his lips and he opened his arms.""Hello, Angel,"" he said as she ran into his arms.""You came! You came! You really came!"" she squealed and she hugged him tightly.""Of course I did. I wouldn't miss dinner with you and Mummy--""""And Uncle John, and Uncle Sherlock, and Maddox, and Molly, and Mrs. Hudson, and Anderson, and Sally, and Aunt Harry!""Mycroft carried her into the house, frowning. ""Aunt Harry? Who the hell is that?"" he asked, narrow eyes darting over the child's face and then looking up into Greg's, who gave a cheeky smile.Angel gasp and pointed to a jar that sat on the table beside the door. ""Daddy! You have to put a pound in the jar for swearing!""Mycroft's eyes widened. ""A pound? I could have sworn the saying was nickel!"" Nonetheless he put a pound in the jar that was already half full.""Go on in the kitchen, Angel,"" Greg said, looking at Mycroft. ""Mummy needs to talk to Daddy for a little bit.""""Yes, sir!"" She gave a mock solute and ran off back into the kitchen screaming 'Uncle Sherwock!' and receiving and irritated 'Sherlock, child, Sherlock!' in return.Mycroft waited three beats later to speak. ""What, Gregory?""Greg crossed his arms. ""Be honest with me--for once in this partnership--how often do you even sit down and eat with her? How often do you see her?""Mycroft's eyes danced over Greg's face. He swallowed thickly. Chocolate eyes looked over him with the scrutiny he often gave when he studied others.""That's what I thought. From now on, every Saturday, seven on the dot. Make it a goddamn priority to eat your daughter. Until you can get some priorities straightened out, Angela is staying with me and Molly.""""You can't take my daughter--""""I can, and I will. I'm her mother, and I'm sure you're well aware of how protective a mother is of her or his pup, correct?""Mycroft shuddered, just slightly, and nodded once. With that, Greg turned on his heels and sauntered back into the kitchen, the vampire right behind him. There were two empty spots at the table. The head of the table and the seat to the right of it. Two plates were already made and waited. Greg took his seat at the head of the table, Mycroft to the right. He looked around the table until he spotted a new face on the left of John.""You are...""""Harry Watson. John's older sister,"" she said strongly.Mycroft gave a tight smile. ""Ah, well. Mycroft Holmes. Sherlock's older brother.""""Older moron,"" Sherlock muttered underneath his breath, earning a stern look from Greg and giggle from John. ""He's only seven years older. I don't know why he thinks he's that much better than me."" ""Brat.""""Boys you better dinner,"" Mrs. Hudson stated, pointing her fork at John, who was already on the last bite. ""He has an appetite.""Sherlock slid his plate over to the pup, but the human wacked him with a spoon. ""You eat what you have on your plate! Look at Anderson! He's almost done!""Sherlock pouted and picked at his food. He took his time to eat, glaring at his brother the entire time as the elder Holmes ate, paying close attention to both him and his daughter telling him the story of the alpha that had came after John and Maddox and how Harry taught her how to braid her own hair.""Daddy, I want to show you aaaaalllll of the stuff me and Mrs. Hudson, and Aunt Harry made!"" Angel said, taking a bite of mashed potatoes.""After you eat your carrots,"" both he and Greg said simultaneously.It wasn't the perfect family dinner, but the hybrid was happy. Sherlock studied his older brother. He wore a smile he had never seen so genuine. The man met Sherlock's eyes briefly before glancing down at the infant pulling on his trousers. He picked Maddox up, cradled him in his arms.""It's time for him to eat, isn't it Sherlock?""""Mm,"" Sherlock grunted in acknowledgement.""May I?"" Mycroft asked, looking at John expectedly.Sherlock was about to tell him 'no' but John nodded, and stood to go warm up a bottle. Greg tsked at Sherlock's reaction and rolled chocolate eyes. John came back a few minutes later with a heated bottle. He handed it to Mycroft, who simply say it on the table for it to cool off a bit. Maddox cooed and giggled, kicking the vampire in the chest until he sat him upright in his lap.""He's developing quickly,"" Mycroft said, humming as he mused his hair. ""He'll be crawling around in no time. Angel was about six months by the time her muscles were strong enough to try and walk. He'll be ready to crawl in a matter of months.""Greg leaned back in his chair. ""He'll be a trouble maker, that's for sure.""""Well of course,"" Sherlock said, looking at his son as Mycroft tapped his left cheek to get Maddox to turn towards his bottle. ""He's got Holmes' DNA in him.""""A scary thought,"" Mycroft hummed. ""We've gotten into some serious trouble before.""""It was all your fault.""""I admit, it was my fault.""""I was stoned when I was ten.""""I apologized.""""How about I put you in a hole and throw rocks the size of your lungs at your head? It wasn't pleasant.""""But you got away.""Sherlock rolled his eyes. Mycroft turned his attention back to his nephew.""I can't wait to see how you'll turn out to be,"" the eldest man said. ""You're an even mix between your parents. Fangs--canines-- are coming in sharp.""Mrs. Hudson cleared her throat. ""Is everyone done eating?"" There were multiple nods. ""Well, everyone helps clean up--even you, Mycroft Holmes!""""But Mrs. Hudson, I--""""Clean! You may be able to kill me easily, but don't think I don't have blackmail, on any of you!""There was a pause. Greg blinked. ""What?""""I didn't stutter, Gregory James.""Anderson bit back laughter. ""Mrs. Hudson, is that what you do in your free time?""""Says the one with his hand down his trousers every night~!"" she said in sing-song.""She's slaying tonight,"" Sally said. ""She's on fire!""Everyone laughed and helped out, Angel running off to play and Maddox being put on the floor to roll around. The table was cleared, dishes were washed, dried, and put up, the counters were wiped, and the floor was swept. Greg washed dishes while Molly dried. Mycroft would squeeze Greg's arse every so often. The first time, he squeaked, as well as the second and third time. After that, he turned red and scrubbed furiously. After the kitchen was clean, Mycroft took his leave, Greg giving him a harsh glare that the vampire seemed to understand, seeing as said vampire nodded once and closes the door. Greg sighed and headed into the sitting room where the rest of his pack was. He sat down on the couch beside Molly, taking her hand.""That wasn't a bad family dinner,"" he said, turning to put his legs in his mate's lap. He rubbed her shoulders. ""And now that the family matter is over, you're free to do whatever. Go on. Shoo! Angel, it's way past your bedtime. Time for you to go to bed.""""But Mummy!""""Bed.""Mrs. Hudson tsked. ""You mind your mother, you hear?"" She ushered the pup upstairs. ""Sherlock, be a dear and bring your boy up while he's not fussy?""Sherlock stood, carefully shifting his son in his arms, soothing him when he started to stir and whine. He hummed softly as he carried him up to Mrs. Hudson's room, laying him down in his crib. ""Sleep well, my son,"" he murmured, smoothing down his hair. He pulled his blanket over him before turning around and stepping aside for the woman. Down the hallway, John stood outside their bedroom door, arms crossed as he leaned against the frame.""Hello, my love,"" Sherlock said, putting an arm around the teen as he opened the door. He lead John in, flicked on the lights and shoved him into the door. ""You astound me every day, John. I got shivers down my back today, when you asserted dominance over me this morning. How I wanted to take you right there on that table.""John shuddered. He wrapped his arms around his lover's neck, jumped and wrapped his legs around his thin form. ""Gonna take me now?"" he murmured.""God yes,"" the vampire groaned, kissing the pup forcefully, John moaning as he let the vampire manhandle him for the night.",Mate Of The Vampire,20657

I found this AU on tumblr and started writing it a very long time ago. But somewhere along the way I supposed I lost interest and deleted it all, until I started thinking about it again and decided to go for it. The original fic was nowhere to be found, so I re-wrote it and voilá!Also, I'm a sucker for comments and I would really love getting some on this one ;)",2015-08-14, General Audiences," Sherlock Holmes/John Watson, Sherlock Holmes & John Watson, Mary Morstan/John Watson","In this world, there is only black and white. Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","Even in this world they say you have moments of clarity. A second when you're hit so hard with a realization that suddenly seems obvious that it waddles your beliefs and shakes your entire world. What was impossible one second is possible the next and what was once out of reach is suddenly in the palm of your hands.They say these moments changes everything. Suddenly your life is upside down. What was wrong is right, what was bad is good, someone who was nothing but a friend turns out to be everything you have ever wanted and more. The world is a different place than what it was before and the people in it have a different meaning to you. You never know when it will hit you, but when it does it does it hard and leaves nothing untouched and the same.But there is a world where these moments are if possible even more clear and changes a lot more. In this world, there are no colours, except for the very few privileged that have had this moment I've been speaking of. In this world, that moment is always the moment you first see your soulmate, your better half, the rest of your life. Call it whatever you want, it's that person. When you first set eyes on each other everything changes. The world is dark and cold no more, the grim black, grey and white are gone. Left is a bright and colourful world where everything is possible.You see, if a man has lived a life without ever seeing anything but black and white, colours are bound to be a huge spectacle. If you look closely, can't you see how beautiful absolutely everything is? Can't you see how gorgeous all colours are and what a miracle it is that we can see them? I don't think you can, no, just to a certain point. Because we see them everyday and we've grown used to them. They are ordinary to us when they shouldn't be. So imagine, imagine a man that has never seen colours before, imagine how wonderful it must be for him, what an absolute miracle it must feel like.Because the colours, they aren't there. It's merely light reflecting against objects, and we create the colours ourselves. Well, those of us who has that ability do. In this world almost everyone possesses that ability and we think no further of it, but in this other world you need help to do it. You need to see something as wonderful and fantastic as the colours in order to be able to see them too. This something is never an object, this something is always a someone.Of course, this is something rare that doesn't occur regularly. It's a one in a milion sort of thing, and you need to be pretty damn lucky to have it happen to you.ABut imagine seeing someone for the first time and seeing the entire world get colours in front of your very eyes. Imagine how it must feel to be able to be completely sure about something, to actually AknowA. You wouldn't have to lay awake at night and analyze your feelings, you wouldn't have to walk home wondering if you made the right call, you wouldn't have to doubt that you two could ever end happily. You would be certain, you would be sure, you would know.AUnless, of course, you wouldn't.***John Watson had an ordinary morning and was set on having an ordinary day. He woke up in his ordinary single bed after an ordinary nightmare about the war and drank an ordinary disgusting cup of coffee on his ordinary uncomfortable chair. His leg ached in its ordinary way and he jumped at any loud noises in his ordinary fashion. It was ordinary, and he didn't know that he would never have an ordinary day for the rest of his life.On the tube a woman gave up his seat for him but he declined where he stood with his cane and almost fell over every time they stopped or started moving again. But he was set on managing on his own, like he always had and always would, and refused to sit down. If she had been just a little more persistent he would had yelled at her.AWhen he walked through the park he had to sit down on a bench for a few minutes, so exhausted was he and so badly did his leg hurt. He tried to think about anything else but couldn't escape the throbbing pain and the way it sometimes shot out into his entire body. Putting any weight on that leg was like playing roulette as it could cave in under him any second and leave him falling flat on his face and looking like a complete loon. It was better to sit there for a while and gain some strenght than to risk that, even if it meant that he would be in a bit late.AEventually he took a deep breath and stood up again. His leg shook a little but didn't give up just yet. He would manage, probably.The snow had just melted and the sky was clear. A person that saw anything but black and white would had called it beautiful. John Watson called it nothing. It looked exactly the same as it had done the day before and he didn't yet know how different it would look the day after.He reached the hospital a few minutes after his shift had started but he didn't hurry, everyone knew he was always late, and what else could they expect from a man with a cane? He pushed the door open slowly and took his time walking up to the reception.”Good morning”, he mumbled.As he kept his eyes at the floor the entire time, afraid that he would step on something and be unable to regain his balance, he didn't see either of them at first. He managed to get all the way up to the desk before he looked up and saw them, and the world seemed to explode in front of him.It was as if lightning strook down at that very spot and for a second he was blinded by a fierce white light and stumbled backwards so that he almost fell over. And then when he could see again, everything looked different.It was bright and it was full of colours. He had never seen such diversity, had never seen things beside each other look so different. It was yellow, blue, pink, red, green, orange and different shades and variations of them all. He had to turn around and look at the entire room and it was so beautiful that he forgot to breathe. There were streaks of blue on the white walls, the couch was green and the plastic chairs were red. The table was dark brown and all the magazines on it had different colours for their the names. The cat on the poster was orange and the apples on the one next to it were a mix of red and yellow. It was strange to think that for so long he had passed through that very same waiting room without seeing all of that, that he had never taken notice of anything, and suddenly he just did.Still in awe he turned back, fully set to see even more beautiful things at and behind the desk, but only one thing caught his eye. She was his age, somewhere in her late 30's. Her hair was blonde and ended just where her neck started, her skin smooth and light, her lips were pink and full and her eyes big and blue. She was sat behind the counter and was by miles the most beautiful thing in there and John just knew, he just knew that this was all because of her. And judging by the large smile on her face, she knew it too.”Hello”, he said.”Hi”, she replied with a giggle.He reached out his hand for her.”Doctor John Watson.””Mary Morstan”, she said while shaking his hand. ”I'm the new receptionist. I started today.”She held it too long and they just stared at each other. There were so many colours. He could had looked at her all day.But then someone cleared his throat next to him, which cause him to pull his hand back and turn to find a man standing there. He was a few years younger than the both of them and much taller too, had dark brown curly hair and eyes that appeared to be every shade of blue possible all at once and was dressed in a dark, long coat and a blue scarf.”Yes?” John said, irritated over being interrupted and angry at this man for ruining what had to be the biggest moment of his life.”I couldn't help but overhear your name and it was you I came here looking for”, the man said with a deep voice.”What for?” John sneered.”I'm conducting an investigation of a crime-””So you're a police officer?”The man smiled as if he was both amused and appalled of the possibility.”God, no. I'm a-””Why are you here then?”John thought it good to make a habit of interrupting him, as he had done himself.”I think you-””Am I a suspect?”He knew it was getting ridicilous now, but he couldn't help it. All he wanted was to get rid off him and get to know this Mary Morstan, because he had waited his entire life to meet her.”Certainly not”, the man replied, now with an anger to his voice that told John that he was best to stay quiet this time. ”I thought you might have information about a case, but I see now that you are indeed not available.””Correct.”The other man frowned.”I shall return tomorrow, then. When you're not as preoccupied”, he added, with a look of disgust aimed at the receptionist.”Do so”, John replied, his focus already back at her.Her cheeks were a little blushed and she got tiny dimples when she smiled.”You have patients”, she said.”I do, don't I?”She laughed. He would rather had spent the entire day with her, but he couldn't go get himself fired now. He would have a wedding to pay for soon.”Dinner?” he asked.”Sure”, she replied.”Send them in in five”, he said before he went to his office.John Watson had never met a person that saw colours. Truth be told, he had often wondered if it even was possible. It had sounded very made up to a person who had seen a war. But he couldn't argue with the fact that now his office suddenly had green walls and his chair was a dark blue.He looked himself in the mirror and found that not only did he have darkblond hair but his clothes didn't match not one bit. And those shoes needed to be gotten rid off. They were black, and hideous. What was the point of having colors if he would walk around with black shoes?The first patient that came in had pink hair. It was absolutely gorgeous.***Mary Morstan was perfect. He took her to the nicest place he knew and she loved it. She ate the same thing as he and adored the wine he had chosen. She told him he looked very dapper in his suit. He told her she looked stunning in her dress. Purple, it was. And beautiful. But not quite as beautiful as her.She was an orphan – he was sorry – and had no siblings. She had spent many years abroad in the states and had only just returned. She loved cats and admitted under many giggles that she had a tattoo of a butterfly on her hip that no one knew about.They had decided to get married before the night was over. In this particular world there's never any confusion, there's never any uncertainty, there's never a 'let's wait and see what happens'. They were destined to be together forever, might as well make it official, might as well rub it in everyone's faces, and they couldn't do it fast enough. When you know, you know.He walked her home in the middle of the night and her hand fitted perfectly in his, as if they had been made for each other. He felt like it was supposed to be there and he had been waiting for it forever. He only let go because he had to go home and sleep before he would need to work again.They kissed outside her door. He had expected it to be big and different, but it was surprisingly ordinary. He was a little disappointment, but what had he expected? Seeing stars? Feeling like he had finally found home? He stopped thinking about it, because it was ridicilous, really. And then he walked home, supported on a cane that almost felt unnecessary now.For the first time in ages he slept through the entire night without a single nightmare.He had already forgotten about the man that was not a police officer and had said that he would come back. ",Life in colour,21241

Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","He didn't have to sit on the bench in the park that morning. He didn't want to either. He couldn't get to Mary fast enough. He even came in early, and there she was behind the desk, still a little of last night's makeup on her face.”Good morning”, she said.”Good morning”, he said.AHe reached over the desk and kissed her and didn't care that it was unprofessional. He'd gone an entire night, no, an entire AlifeA, without kissing her. Now he could, so now he would.A”If someone's early, just send them in anyway”, he said as he walked away.”Will do”, she replied.He was completely uninterested in anyone that stepped through the door until he was about to leave for lunch and in stepped the very same man he had met the day before.”I'm sorry”, he told him. ”It appears I'm preoccupied today as well. I'm just going out for lunch.””Why then I'll join you”, the stranger said as his eyes flew across the entire room in a rapid pace and seemed to take in absolutely everything in there.”I was actally going out with my fiancée-””The receptionist”, the man finished. ”So I noticed. But I promise you this is more important.”This man was arrogant, a little creepy and hadn't looked at him once since he had stepped in the room, yet John didn't want to say no.”How so?” he asked, because he couldn't help but be a little intrigued and very excited over the prospect of helping solving a crime.The stranger suddenly looked right at him and smirked.”There's this lovely little place on Torquay Terrace”, he said. ”Charpentier's. Will it do?”John had never heard of Charpentier's, but it did very well and before he knew it they were in a cab heading towards Torquay Terrace.”So, what is this case you're investigating?” John asked, as the odd fellow had been quiet the entire journey.”A murder”, he replied.”Do you mind me asking why you are investigating it, if you're not a police officer?”At this point the man turned to him with an odd look on his face.”As a matter of fact, I do mind”, he said. ”Do you mind being quiet until we get to the pub?”John didn't mind, if he was going to be that unpleasant every time he opened his mouth.And at the pub they arrived. It was dark and gloomy and smelled of smoke. The menus were rough around the edges and hard to read in the bad lightning, but John finally managed to make out that they had fish and chips and made his order.”I'm not having anything”, the other man told the waitress.John couldn't help but get irritated over being dragged halfway across town to eat at this dump with someone who didn't wish to talk to or eat with him when he could had had a pleasant meal with Mary instead.”Why did you join me for lunch if you didn't plan on eating?” he asked. ”And why did you drag me here, of all places?””I though it'd be nicer”, the man in the coat mumbled while looking out through the window.”You haven't been here?””No, I have not.”John laughed.”Could you at least tell me what this is all about?” he demanded. ”Because I'll get up and walk out of here any second now.”He saw a sudden desperation flash across the other man's eyes.”I will”, he said. ”Just stay.”John's food arrived so fast that they couldn't possibly have cooked it after he ordered it. Finally the man who had dragged him there started speaking.”Earlier this week an American named Enoch Drebber was murdered – stabbed to death, if you must – in an abandoned house at Lauriston Gardens”, he said. ”And I have every right to believe that his murderer is a patient of yours.””How so?” John asked, with his mouth full of fish that didn't really taste anything.”Because I've managed to point out which area he lives in and St Bart's is the closest hospital, and I have since questioned the other doctors there without finding him”, the stranger explained. ”Now will you let me continue or do you have any more questions?”John had a lot of questions. For example how he had managed to learn where this murderer lived, why he would be going to any hospital at all, and what the bloody hell he was doing, trying to solve a murder. But he had a feeling he would get his answers and shook his head.”Do you know who he is?” he asked. ”The murderer?”John stared at him in disbelief.”Excuse me?””Oh, right, sorry”, the man apologized. ”Do you need details? He's with all probability American. He would have military background, like you, he would be quiet and not like to talk about his past. He would be single and not very interested in relationships. Oh, and he is dying. Something that doesn't make him very sick, but can take him out any day. He would be indifferent to it though, not very emotional. Does it ring a bell?””I really shouldn't-””Please do.””I don't even have my files on me-””You would remember him.”John did remember him, but he did not feel comfortable giving one of his patients up like that to a man who wasn't even a police. But at the same time, he actually wanted to.”You know who it is, don't you?” the stranger said.John sighed.”Yes”, he said. ”I do know who it is.””Very well then”, the other man said. ”Do you happen to know his profession?””As a matter of fact, I do.”It had been a pure coinscidence that he had ever found out about it, because Jefferson Hope was just as the stranger had deduced not a very talkative person. But one day he had came in a bit late, talking about a client that had given him the wrong adress, and John had learned what he did for a living.”He's a cab driver, is he not?” the stranger asked.John's jaw dropped.”How on earth do you know that?”The stranger smirked.”Because when he died Enoch Drebber was so drunk that he couldn't possibly have walked from here to where he was found, and as he had no friends in town he couldn't have gotten there in anything but a cab”, he explained. ”Now, we can only assume that in that cab was the murderer, and no man would be dumb enough to take a cab with his victim to the scene of the crime. And as a witness has told us that a cab stopped at Lauriston gardens at the time of the murder and left some 20 minutes later, the murderer must then have been the driver of that cab.”It seemed so obvious when he said it like that, that John felt stupid for not realizing it himself.”But how do you know he's dying?” he asked instead.”All in good time”, the stranger said. ”Now, what is his name?”Before he could stop himself, John had blurted it out. The stranger smiled contently.”The food is on me”, he said.Then he paid at the bar and walked out. John saw him through the window, waiting for an empty cab to pass by and pick him up. He knew he really should be getting back to St Bart's before his lunch ended. But there was something about this man, maybe the way he talked, maybe the adventure he meant, maybe only the fact that John had just started seeing colours and everything was exciting to him. Whatever it was, he left his food only half-eaten and joined him.”Mind if I join?” he asked.”Not at all”, the stranger smiled down at him just as a cab pulled up beside them. ”I was hoping for it, actually.”They got in the car and the driver was ordered to drive to Scotland Yard. John assumed that he would give them the name he had just learned and thought no more of it. Either way, it was exciting, more exciting than anything had ever been after he had returned from Afghanistan.They stopped outside Scotland Yard and the other man was out in a second.”Will you wait here?” he asked the driver.John got out too, walked over to the other side of the car and leaned on it. He saw the man he had met just the other day practically run up the stairs like a child with a new toy and smiled to himself.He opened his mouth and turned to the driver, but in the sudden shock something completely different than he had intended to say escaped his mouth.”Mr Hope?!” he exclaimed.The suspected murderer looked back at him, equally as shocked.”Doctor Watson!” he cried. ”Why, I didn't realize it was you!””And I didn't realize it was you!”AHe started thinking immidately. What were the chances that Ahis Acab would pick them up? Slim, next to none. It could be a coincidence, sure, but-A”No one ever notices the driver!” his companion cried out as he came running down towards them, now with a tanned, grey-haired man around 50 right behind him. ”Mr Drebber certainly didn't!”The cab driver stared at him with his mouth open and his face completely stated, but didn't even try to make a run for it.”Would you please step out of the car, sir?” the man John's new friend had brought with him ordered.Jefferson Hope did so without hesitation.”I am detective inspector Lestrade of the Scotland Yard and you, Mr Jefferson Hope, are under arrest for the murder of Mr Enoch Webber”, the grey-haired man explained.John stood there unable to say anything as his patient was taken away.”What is it that he has?” the man who had caught him asked. ”Why is he dying?””An aneurysm”, John replied.”Of course, naturally.”John looked at him.”How'd you know he would pick us up?” he asked.”Well, considering the shifts cabbies have”, the stranger began, ”and the fact that he was working the evening of Drebber's murder, then his shift would had just begun at the time when I left that pub. And since the cab station is up the street and we were at the busiest road, he would come driving down it right about then. It was pure luck that no one stopped him before I did though.””You need to tell me all about this”, John demanded.”Shouldn't you be getting back to the hospital?” the stranger teased.John didn't even bother looking at his watch, he knew his lunch was already over.”It can wait.”***”Well, it was like this”, the stranger told him, as they were seated at a bench inside Scotland Yard. ”Drebber was found dead at Lauriston Gardens with a woman's wedding ring beside him and the name Rachel scrabbled onto the wall with his blood. Now I naturally started thinking about possible motives, but as he was a loner here in the country I couldn't find any. But then I looked into his police records from America and found that he had several times been arrested for domestic violence against his wife. Yes, you guess right, her name was indeed Rachel.ANow, this Rachel Drebber died over eight years ago. She was murdered, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. The couple lived in a small town in Ohio, so you can imagine how talk went. Everyone must have known that her husband was abusive, so they must also have known that he killed her. This is what must have made him flee the country seven and a half years ago and come here. ABut would anyone, several years later, fly to England to murder this man and make his wife justice? No, bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. There must have been a lover, and it was probably also why she was murdered. But why not kill him there and then, before he could get a chance to escape? Obviously this lover of hers must have been elsewhere at the time of her death, only to find out when he returned home. Because two years after she had died – note the time difference, it's important – her grave was robbed, of her wedding ring of all things. A witness said a man ran away from the scene. This could be a coinscidence, but another six years later her husband is found dead. Where does a man go away for two years, and why does he wait another six to get revenge on the man who ruined his life? Well, in America, enlisted soldiers must do two years of active duty in war and most often six more back in the country. So he must have enlisted after he met her, came back home to find her dead and as soon as he could, he followed the murderer over here to make him pay for it.The death sentence, you wonder? Why that was obvious. He wrote her name on the wall, he wanted to know why this man had been murdered and he wanted people to know that he had done it. It didn't matter to him. But most importantly, he left her ring there. He had opened up her grave to get that ring and he had kept it with him for six years, it was obviously very important and of great value to him. Why then, would he leave it there? If not because it wouldn't be of any use to him anyway, as he was already knocking on heaven's door, so to say? No, this was the final act of a dying man.”John stared at him in disbelief.”A little far fetched, is it not?” he said.”Is not a man under arrest right now?””Why yes, but-””Then I was successful”, he concluded. ”All these deductions brought me to Jefferson Hope.””But it can't all be correct”, John protested. ”You couldn't possibly have guessed everything correctly!””Oh, I never guess.”And with that he left, leaving John alone to try and wrap his head around everything he had just heard. It couldn't be true, it couldn't be! But he made it all sound so simple and obvious, as if the answer was clear as day.He returned a few minutes later and handed John a paper.”Here's the written version of his confession”, he said.AMy name is Jefferson Hope. A little over eight years ago I met and fell in love with Rachel Drebber. She was married, but to a cruel man she did not love and promised to divorce him as soon as I had gotten back, as I had just enlisted in the army and could not change my mind. AAI left with the knowledge that she was waiting for me and it was the only thing that kept my spirit up while I was at war, but when I came back for her she was nowhere to be found. I learned that she was dead, and everyone in town were just as certain as me that her husband was responsible. I swore vengeance on him but he had already fled to Europe and I was kept from following by my duty to the country. The only thing I could do was dig up her grave and take her wedding ring, so that she would not be bound to that awful man in the afterlife.AAJust before I was relieved of my duty I was diagnosed with an aneurysm. I knew then that I would have to worry about no consequences and could freely extract revenge on Enoch Drebber. I headed to England the first day I could, and to get to know the city and locate the man I was looking for I took work as a cab driver.AAOn the evening of last Thursday I set eyes on him outside a pub on Torquay Terrace and I picked him up. He was drunk as can be and didn't notice that I took him not to his apartment but to an abandoned building at Lauriston Gardens. I helped him into the building, told him why he would die, and stabbed him until I was satisfied and he had taken his last breath.AAI confess to the murder of Enoch Drebber.AUnder the machine written text, written with a pen, was; Your cane is still at Charpentier's and your limp is psycholosomatic.John looked up and found that the man who had written it was gone, and he had been so focused on reading that he hadn't noticed him go. He was awfully disappinted that he hadn't, because this really wasn't over to him. He wanted to get to know this mysterious man, whoever he might be. What he didn't know was that their paths would cross again, in a not so distant future.What he felt must have showed on his face, because when detective inspector Lestrade stepped into the corridor right beside him he directly took on a smug face and smirked.”I see you've met Sherlock Holmes.” ",Life in colour,21241

Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","The wedding was held that August in a lovely little church just outside London. Champagne was flowing and dances were danced. John and Mary Watson received many compliments and congratulations. She was beautiful and he was handsome.Harry didn't approve of her brother's new wife and the bride's side of the church was empty, as she didn't have any family and all her friends were on the other side of an ocean. At one point she spilled some Chardonnay on her gorgeous dress and the ring bearer dropped John's ring during the ceremony. But weddings can't be all merry and happy, can they?In the end they laughed at it and danced their waltz as if nothing had ever happened. It was a joyous occasion, the day the doctor got his secretary. The cake was delicious and many wonderful speeches were delivered. Mike Stamford was best man and one of the female doctors at St Bart's was a brides maid. The weather was wonderful, the sky was blue and the sun was shining. The newlyweds were driven away in a white limousine after the party.It was a perfect day for a perfect couple.John never did get back to that pub and retrieved his cane.***Mary had been looking for a new job since after the wedding. She had said that they shouldn't be working together now that they were married and he had agreed, even though he rather would've spent his entire days with her. She became secretary at a law firm called Small's in November of that year and a young woman named Sarah took her place at the hospital.His wife seemed content enough with married life, but John started getting restless. He felt like something was wrong, like he was missing out on something. He couldn't explain it, he just wanted something else, anything else. Not that he didn't want Mary, he would always want her, but he had found the cracks beneath her surface and he wasn't pleased with what he'd seen.She could be odd sometimes, to the point of scary. Her reflexes were unnaturally fast and she could get all dark in her eyes when she got angry. When John had found a wounded bird in the garden of the house they rented together in the suburbs he had given it some water before going to work, to see if it would had regained some strenght and flown away by the time he got back. When he did he found nothing but a small puddle of blood.”I put it out of it's misery”, Mary said without an ounce of emotion on her face.But every time he ever doubted her, he looked into her blue eyes and realized why he loved her so much. She was meant to be his and he was meant to be hers, and they brought colours into each other's lives. Every night he laid awake and thought about it, that's what he told himself.And he never did get that Sherlock Holmes bloke out of his mind. He had told Mary about him and the day they solved that crime together – well, that day Sherlock had solved a crime and John had watched him do it – over and over again. He couldn't stop talking about it, couldn't stop thinking about it. The smallest things would remind him of it, like fish and chips, an old man with a cane, or a cab passing by.ANo one ever notices the driver.AHe was so fascinated and intrigued by this Sherlock Holmes that solved crimes for the fun of it that he even appeared in his dreams sometimes, with his dark locks, infinite eyes and prominent cheekbones, talking quickly and making conclusions from everything.”I swear, for all this that I hear about him you could have a crush on this Holmes boy”, Mary would joke and hit him lightly with her elbow. ”Don't you dare go running off to solve crimes with him!”ABitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator.AOne day John found a small article in the paper that stated that convicted murderer Jefferson Hope had passed away in prison.”Look!” he said and showed it to Mary. ”It's that man I helped catch!”She didn't bother to look at it, so busy was she with breakfast.”No offense, John darling”, she said as she buttered her toast. ”But from what I've heard Sherlock Holmes would've caught him all by himself if you hadn't helped.”John had thought about that too, very often. A man with the mind of Sherlock Holmes could easily have solved that crime, with or without help. He had it practically solved himself and he would had gotten Hope's name within hours even if John hadn't given it to him, yet he had come to the hospital, walked into his office and dragged him with him to lunch. Why had he done that? What use could he possibly have had of John?”Well, he's dead now anyway”, he said and turned the page.***One grim January afternoon, a month which John had learned to hate now that he knew that he world could be so much more colorful than that, he had ran out of patients and decided to go pick up Mary from the Small's office, as her day would be ending soon too.He walked slowly through the city and the wet snow. Birds that hadn't left Britain over the winter were chirping in the trees around him and the sun was peeking through the clouds for the first time in what seemed like forever. Here and there someone said hello to him and he smiled and said hello back, and when no one did he hummed to himself on some old song. He was in a jolly mood for whatever reason, and the entire world seemed to be within his reach. He had often felt that way since he had first seen the colors. The world seemed a better place with them in it, or he just took notice of the good things now.The air was chilly but he was properly dressed. He didn't have a worry in the world.”Lovely day, isn't it?” he said as he came through the door at the office and found Mary at her usual place at the desk.”Give me a cheery husband and I'm satisfied”, she said as he leaned over and kissed her. ”Hello there, mister.””G'afternoon, mrs Watson”, he grinned.They pulled apart.”All set to go?””Just a few minutes more and Irene'll be in”, Mary replied.John didn't mind waiting. If he had waited almost 40 years to find her he could wait a few minutes to bring her home.Still with a smile on his face he went and sat down among the long-faced people waiting to meet a lawyer. He started looking through a magazine without really reading anything in it and was carelessly humming a little to himself when a breeze went by and someone sat down in the chair next to him.”Evening, doctor”, a low voice said.John looked up at the tall man beside him.”Why, who isn't it unless bloody Sherlock Holmes?” he said.Sherlock smirked.”So you know who I am.””Not because you told me though.””No”, Sherlock repeated. ”Not because I told you.”Well, what's he doing here?” John asked and put down the magazine, because it didn't interest him at all as much as Holmes did.”Investigating another case”, he replied.”But he's still not a police?””Nor will he ever be.”John laughed.”What is he then?” he asked. ”Because I can vaguely recall solving another one of these crimes with him a few months ago.””I'm a consulting detective”, Sherlock replied. ”The only one in the world. People come to me with their troubles and I usually help them.””But that's a private detective”, John chimed in. ”And there are quite a lot of those out there.””Why, yes”, Sherlock agreed. ”But the police don't consult private detectives, now do they?””Not usually, no.”Sherlock nodded contently.”But what's this case you're investigating now?” John asked.Even if he wouldn't be needed he wanted to hear about it, wanted to hear about anything that was more interesting and exciting than his ordinary, boring life with a wife and house out in the suburbs.”Oh, nothing special really”, Sherlock said with an indifferent voice. ”This fellow named Bartholomew Sholto has been found dead in his room in the apartment he shares with his brother. He appears to have been some sort a drug addict so there could be nothing more to it, except he died of an overdose of Potassium Chloride, and that is no drug one takes for pleasure. But all doors and windows were locked from the inside, so it's as always up to me to prove that the brother did it.””The brother?” John cried. ”But why would he have killed him?””Money, of course”, Sherlock replied. ”They've been quarrelling quite a bit about who's to inherit what from their recently deceased father. Bartholomew appears to have been the one with the right, but Thaddeus might not have agreed about that.””And what are you doing here?””Oh, just going to read through the old man's will and confirm my motive”, Sherlock said, as if it was all routine. ”It's supposed to be here.”At this point Mary came up to them, already dressed in her coat and with her bag on her arm.”Are you ready to leave, love?” she asked in her soft, sweet voice.”Mary!” John said, because he had already forgotten that it was her he was there for. ”This is Sherlock Holmes!””Oh”, she said. ”The Sherlock Holmes? I though I recognized you.”Sherlock stared her up and down with a light frown on his face.”I think I'd better go”, he said and stood up. ”Mr Small is probably waiting for me.””You don't have an appointment”, Mary protested.”He knows me”, Sherlock said, as he walked away from them with long, hurried steps.”Curious fellow, that one”, Mary said with a giggle.Her husband looked after said curious fellow with longing in his eyes. He wanted so badly to walk with him, to follow him on another adventure, to be there when he solved yet another case. He wanted so badly to do anything but sit next to Mary one more night and eat one more dinner in complete silence.”Mary”, he said. ”Would you mind if I waited here for him?”She looked surprised, perhaps a bit hurt.”Of course not”, she said. ”Do you think you'll be home for dinner?”John smiled at the prospect of blood pumping through his veins, the thrill of the chase, just he and Sherlock Holmes against the rest of the world.”I don't think so.”***He stood up the second Sherlock returned and grinned when he asaw the surprise he felt over seeing him there.”Where to?” he asked.”Pondicherry lodge”, Sherlock replied, a smile slowly forming on his lips.There's always a cab to catch in central London, and they were on their way within the minute.”Did you confirm your theory?” John asked as they headed towards their destination.”Very much so”, Sherlock replied. ”The father left it all for Bartholomew, but he left it all for Thaddeus.”The apartment building was located in a quiet neighbourhood with well cared for houses and a few children in school uniforms on the street. It didn't look like a place where a man would kill his own brother, but exteriors can misguide you.The Sholto apartment was at the top floor and Thaddeus greeted them at the door, seemingly unaware that he was Sherlock's prime suspect.”Thank God you're here!” he yelled with a high voice. ”You need to free me from these horrendous accusations!””We'll need to take a look around the place”, the consulting detective said.”Of course! Take all the time you need.”Sherlock walked through the messy kitchen and across the crowded lounge and didn't even look towards Thaddeus' bedroom or the bathroom. He had his eyes set on the room where Bartholomew Sholto had ended his days.”Do you see the roof?” he said, immediately as he and John stepped inside it.”It's a door to the attic!” John exclaimed.”Precisely”, Sherlock said. ”I've never seen such an obvious case!”He headed towards it, pulling it down and revealing a ladder. He pulled that down as well and had climbed up it in no time, while John stood in the room and waited for his return.”It's their part of the attic!” the detective shouted from above him. ”It's locked from the outside!”John laughed.”It's solved then, is it?” he said.”Quite so”, Sherlock said as he climbed down the ladder again. ”Thaddeus goes up the attic from the other way, climbs down to his brother's room, gives him some Potassium, locks all doors and windows and climbs back. He goes through the attic, comes down the stairs and walks right back into the apartment, and voilá; the money is his.”At the sudden sound of a gasp coming from the doorway both men turned around and saw the man in question stand there.”He was a junkie!” he screamed. ”All he would do was to shoot up the money, father never should've given it to him in the first place!””Well, whatever you think”, Sherlock said, stepping closer to him with a proud grin on his face. ”I'm turning you in for his murder.””I guess you can't run from the law”, Thaddeus found as he leaned against the doorway.”Oh!” Sherlock Holmes laughed. ”The law you can run from, from me you can not!””Very well”, the murderer said, still surprisingly calm and without attempting to escape or make them change their minds. ”But I just boiled us all tea.”Sherlock looked to John, as if he was actually contemplating the idea of tea with the man he was about to give up to the police.”We're not having tea!” John shouted, because for him it was clear as day.”I was just checking”, Sherlock muttered. ",Life in colour,21241

I'm thinking it's Mary that helped me got over it.”At this, Sherlock twitched almost unnoticeably and broke eye contact to look out the window.”You know”, John continued without noticing, ”I see the colours now.””Oh”, Sherlock said. ”You know, I never believed in them.””Well”, John said, ”they're very real.””I know they're real”, Sherlock hissed. ”I said believed, as in did.”Without thinking further of why he had suddenly turned so hostile, John changed the subject.”How do you know Angelo?””Got him off a murder charge.””Naturally.””For me it is.”John thought about how he had only met this man three days in total with a year apart, and he had during those days handed two different men in to the police for different crimes, and realized that it was indeed natural and regular to him. That was his life, and suddenly John realized something that was almost as big as the moment he had first seen the colours; it could be his life too.He could pack up his bags and leave, he could file for a divorce and quit his job. He didn't have to live the same old routine – the one he had gotten bored off a month after it had started – day after day, he didn't have to be bored out of his mind every bloody day. If he wanted to go he could. He could live the life Sherlock lived, and every day could be like that afternoon had been. He could solve crimes and achieve things on a regular basis if he wanted to. If he only dared to take that leap, if he only dared to take the step, if he could be brave enough to leap into infinity, if he-”Here you go”, Angelo interrupted his thoughts as he put down their plates in front of them.”Thank you”, John said.Sherlock didn't say a word, but gave him a small smile.He remained silent through the entire meal, even when John occasionally made a forced remark about something in the restaurant. Suddenly they had nothing to say each other, and it wasn't strange at all. Because without a case to solve they had nothing in common, they were too different and lived different lives. There was nothing they could have a casual conversation about. All John could do was say that his food tasted well and all Sherlock could reply was ”good”.It was first when they had finished that John realized that there was something he had been wondering about ever since they had first had Jefferson Hope arrested and convicted.”There's one thing I don't understand about the Drebber case”, he said. ”Why did Hope join the army in the first place when he had met Rachel, and why didn't she leave her husband even if her lover wasn't there anymore?”Sherlock bit his lip and looked out the window as he appeared to think about it.”I suppose that sometimes people are too afraid to take the step and do what they really want to”, he said after a while. ”Sometimes it's very complicated. Sometimes you might think it's for the best to stay away and forget about it altogether, and sometimes you end up stuck with the wrong person and there's really nothing you can do about it. Maybe they were going to run away, but they waited too long and missed the chance.”John frowned.”I still don't get it.””Trust me”, said Sherlock. ”Neither do I.”He waved for Angelo to come with the bill, and John insisted on paying as he was a doctor and one can't really make much money as a consulting detective. Sherlock didn't protest and they were soon out on the pavement, waiting for a cab.”This was fun”, John said. ”I think I would like to do it again.””Really?” Sherlock replied.”Really.”Sherlock smirked.”I suppose it's a little less responsibility to solve people's deaths than to save their lives”, he remarked.John didn't know if he should be offended, but decided to laugh instead.”You can be fun, you know”, he said. ”When no one is around, for me you are funny.””If that's the case, then you're funny for me too”, the detective said.He waved at a cab that only passed them by.”If you wouldn't mind”, John started, suddenly feeling nervous as if he was back in fourth grade asking that cute girl out on a date, ”I could take your adress and we might do this again.”The taller man by his side suddenly looked at him in surprise.”I wouldn't mind at all”, he said.”Put it in my phone”, John told him and handed it to him.As Sherlock wrote he managed to have a cab drive up next to them and stop.”Are you coming with?” he said as he opened the door.”No, I'm walking”, Sherlock replied while handing him the phone back.John looked down and read the adress. 221B Baker Street.”Hey, Sherlock”, he said as he looked up in confusion.The man in question was already several feet away and didn't hear him.”Sherlock!”He only raised a hand and didn't stop walking.John looked back at the phone just to make sure that he hadn't misread anything, only to see that he most certainly hadn't. Because the adress wasn't what had made him call out for Sherlock Holmes, but it was the thing that he had written below it, something that he couldn't wrap his head around.AGood luck with the little one.A***John rushed up the frontyard and slammed the door open, already catching his breath. Mary was in the kitchen, placed in front of the sink full of dirty dishes with one hand resting on her stomach. As soon as he saw that scene all the doubt he had felt was gone.”Are you pregnant?” he asked loudly, grabbing the closest chair as he started feeling dizzy and overwhelmed.She opened her mouth and looked down at the hand she had placed there subconsciously.”Are you pregnant?” her husband repeated.She looked back up at him, completely out of words.”I was going to tell you-” she started.”Am I going to be a father?” John interrupted.Her eyes watered slightly and a smile formed on her lips, then she nodded.John turned around, it was too much for him. Did he want a baby? Yes, he did, of course he did, don't everyone? He wanted a little version of himself, someone he would look out for and protect for the rest of his life, someone that would know every side of him and love him anyway. But in that moment, he didn't. Not after he had played with that thought at dinner, not when he had considered the possibility. Was a child really what he wanted? Wasn't it that other thing that he wanted, that other life?”I was going to tell you”, Mary said. ”I just wanted to find a good moment.”He turned to look at her, expecting to feel differently about her, to some how be aware of the fact that she was carrying his child inside her. He felt nothing, not even when she looked at him with those expectant eyes and smiled an unsure smile.”Aren't you happy?” she asked.AI don't know”, Ahe thought. AI really don't know.ABut he knew what he was supposed to say, what he had to say.”Of course I am”, he said.She stepped up to him and he embraced her. She laughed with her head at his shoulder as he stared at the wall with fear in his eyes.”We're going to have a baby”, she said.John stroked her on the back.ANoA, he realized. AThis isn't what I want.A***He told Mary he wanted to get to the hospital early. He told the cab driver to drive to Baker Street. He stared out the window, saw buildings pass by, couples and people without company, with or without children. It looked dreadfully boring, and he imagined himself like that. With a tiny little person in a stroller, staring out into the distance and wishing that he had taken the chance he had turned down.A short older woman opened the door marked 221B.”I'm John Watson”, he said. ”I'm here to see Mr Holmes.””Oh”, she said and broke out into a huge smile. ”So you're the famous doctor!”He blinked.”You know who I am?””Of course!” the woman said. ”He talks about you constantly!”John was instructed to go up the stairs and did so. Still in a daze he knocked on a door and a familiar voice told him to come in. He stepped directly into a lounge, that apart from a smaller couch, a table and a chair was overcrowded with all sorts of things.Sherlock Holmes was laying on that couch, dressed in a blue robe rather than the coat John was familiar with. At the sight of the doctor the detective flew up, but stayed by the couch instead of walking up to greet him.”John-” he exclaimed.”How did you know?” the man in question demanded.He too stayed put at his place by the door.”Simple really”, Sherlock said, because for him apparently everything was simple. ”Apart from a smaller weight gain and slightly enlarged breasts-””Did you look at my wife's breasts?!”Confused by the sudden interruption, Sherlock found himself at loss of words and gaped.”Well, I looked at every part of her, really-” he tried, without knowing that it was all in vain and that it only made things worse.”Oh, you did?” John laughed. ”Really?””I'm not interested in your wife”, Sherlock hissed.For a short time both men stood quietly and stared at each other. John wasn't mad at him because he had looked at his wife, nor because he had revealed something she should've gotten the chance to do herself. He was mad at him because he had just ruined everything, because he had just made what had been very possible the day before completely impossible for the rest of eternity. It was his own fault, really, but he was still mad at Sherlock, because Sherlock had crushed his dreams before he had even dared to dream them.”What now?” he asked, as much to himself as to Sherlock.The latter shrugged his shoulders.”There's not much you can do, is there?” he replied. ”And even if there was, why would you do it?”John bit his lip.”No”, he said. ”Of course not.”He looked around the room, noticed but thought no further of everything in there. Least of all a small painting that was still drying off on its stand. It was a simple landscape motive, only grass and a blue sky. It was tiny and unsignificant and nothing special at all, but it would had changed so much if he had only given it a second glance.Sherlock cleared his throat and John looked back at him.”How about doing it again?” he said, even though he already knew the answer.”That won't happen”, the taller man with the hypnotizing blue eyes confirmed.John was going to be a father now, his whole life would change again, of course there would be no time to chase after criminals in dark alley ways or wait for the cab with that particular shady driver. Of course it wouldn't happen, and he knew it.”Naturally”, he said.He felt down, he felt disappinted, he didn't know what he felt. Nothing ever went according to plan, and he should had know that by now. But he was still just as disappointed, still felt like he had lost something, but he hadn't really had it in the first place.Sherlock smiled a weak smile towards him.”Go home”, he said. ”Be with your wife.”And John did. ",Life in colour,21241

Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","AJohn was crouching in the back of an ambulance car travelling down a bumpy road. He held tight on the handle on the roof and had his head between his legs. He was going to throw up, he knew it. If they weren't there yet, he would throw up. Then all he could do was hope these wounded soldiers weren't conscious enough to notice it.AAAmir was singing in the front seat. John had given up on telling him to stop doing it around the same time he had given up on trying to get him to drive slower. Amir understood English, when he wanted to.AAA sudden turn almost had him slide down on the floor. Deep breaths, deep breaths and he wouldn't lose his breakfast. But it was easier said than done, out in the Afghan desert.AAHe didn't know how badly injured the soldiers he was sent out to take back to the hospital were. They could be pretty okay already, or they could be close to dying and there wasn't anything he would be able to do to help them. He hated when that happened, when he had to see their lives end and hear them take their last breath, without being able to do anything. He would never get used to it.AAHe didn't notice it when Amir first stopped singing. He directly felt the change in the atmosphere, but he couldn't tell what was different. Not until the car stopped. But not even then did he think any further of it or get worried. John Watson was an army doctor, but he hadn't been through so many awful things. He didn't know what that shiver in his bones or the cold in his chest meant.AAHe heard his driver open the door and get out. Amir would usually come back and open the back doors while he prepared stretcher, but the doors didn't open this time, so John got up and opened them himself.AAThe sight hit him as soon as he had done it. Masked rebels with rifles and machineguns resting on their shoulders were stood right before him. Amir was on his knees on the ground and someone had a gunpipe at his neck.AAJohn froze. He forgot all about his training and had no idea what to do. He was completely certain that this were his last minutes on earth, that he was going to die.AThe colours, he thought. I never saw the colours.AHe had lived in black and white and he would die in black and white. He would never know what the fuss was all about, he would never know the beauty of colours. He would die right there and then, all alone in the desert, shot like a dog.AAIt was as if he moved in slow motion. They shouted something at him that he didn't understand, and he got out of the car without making a noise. Someone hit him with a rifle and he got down on his knees. He looked to Amir on his side. He was young and had his whole life ahead of him. Tears were streaming down his face. He wouldn't see the colours either.AAHe looked down at the ground and closed his eyes when the shot rang out. The man beside him fell down as a lifeless corpse and stared up at the sky with dead eyes. Blood ran along the ground beneath him. How old had Amir been, 24, 25? Too young either way.AAJohn closed his eyes and bit his lip, preparing for the shot that would end it all. He felt the hard ground against his knees, blood was making his trousers wet and the wind was blowing in his face. This was it, this was the end. There would be nothing more after this, nothing would ever happen again. He heard a clicking noise, felt a single tear roll down his cheek, and-A”John”, he heard a panicked voice beside him say.He was awake again, very much alive and in Britain, not in Afghanistan. He had Mary beside him and not Amir's dead body, he was in a warm, soft bed and not on his knees on the ground in the middle of the desert. He was fine, he didn't have a gun pointed at him, he was fine.”John!” his wife yelled. ”My water just broke!”He was up on his feet in an instant, dressing in a military fashion and without once panicking. He had been in a bloody war, he could get his wife to the hospital without breaking down over it. He helped her put on clothes, as she panted and supported herself on him.Get off me,  he wanted to tell her. You're heavy, get off me.But he didn't say a word, because she was his pregnant wife and she was in labour and a few hours later she would give him a daughter. Then things would be alright again, then he wouldn't be so bored anymore. Then he could finally stop thinking about Sherlock Holmes and his silly crimes.”Are you alright?” he asked.”Do I look alright?!” she cried.She wanted to brush her hair before they went, but he pulled her with him to the car. He wasn't going to deliver that child on his own, no, he was taking her to a hospital even if she thought she looked awful.”Do you have the bag?” she asked.He didn't have the bag, but it wasn't because he was panicking but because she was stressing him. He ran into get it from where he'd put it on the kitchen table. And there he stopped.He had it over his shoulder and looked at the kitchen and it didn't feel real. It didn't feel like home. For so long had he watched Mary cook in it, so many times had he boiled tea water on that stove, so many nights had they spent sitting at that table. But it didn't feel like home.Why doesn't it feel like home?  he thought. This is home. Why doesn't it feel like home?He heard Mary scream his name from the car, and he ran out to her. Because how does home really feel? There's no definition of home, there's no way to tell where you belong. That house was lovely and had wonderful colours, and it was home. Whether he liked it or not.It was still dark outside, not many cars passed by them. He drove under the speed limit, had no rush. Even as she screamed beside him.”How far apart are the contraptions?” he asked her in his military voice.He didn't think it a big thing, for some reason. Saw it only as routine, not something life changing and earth shattering. They were just driving to the hospital, and she would give birth and they would drive home as parents. He had been prepared for that for months, so he never had a big moment of revelation as they sat in that car.He just wanted her to stop screaming, because he couldn't concentrate when she was that loud. But he couldn't ask her to stop, he knew he wasn't supposed to. So he only bit down hard and drove.***John was a doctor, but he wasn't worried. He wasn't worried when Mary stopped screaming entirely, when her grip around his arm loosened or her head started rolling at her shoulders and her eyelids started to close. He just stood by her side and held the bag, and wondered when the right time would be to put it down. It was heavy, but he didn't know when he was supposed to walk across the room and put it down in a chair. It never seemed appropiate.He wasn't worried when the doctor started getting stressed and screamed at the nurses. He wasn't worried when he shoved him out the door and told him that they needed to do a caesarean section. He didn't ask how long it would take or if they would both be alright, he didn't even wonder if his child or wife would survive. He just said okay, and then he asked which way the café was.John roamed the long halls and corridors with a coffee in his hand and the bag still on his shoulder. He looked at the babies through a window and smiled at the nurse taking care of them when she waved politely at him. He ate pretty decent eggs in the restaurant and read a magazine about male fashion with Robert Downey Jr on the cover without actually making sense of the words. He wasn't that interested in fashion. He bought a second coffee and walked around some more, like an aggitated, restless ghost without anywhere to go.He wished it would be over soon. Not because he was worried about his wife and not because he wanted to meet his first child, but because he was tired and he wanted to go back to the house and sleep a few hours. Because he was bored and all the sick and wounded people depressed him and he didn't want to be near them. Because the coffee didn't even taste that good. He wondered if Mary would be very angry if she woke up and he had gone home. He hadn't read any books about this, he didn't know what he was supposed to do or not.But he knew he was supposed to feel something. He knew he was supposed to be happy over becoming a faher and excited over finally having a child and that he should be bursting with anticipation and not be able to wait another second. He knew he was supposed to be really worried about Mary on the operating table and fear that she would die and what on earth he would do then. He knew it, but he didn't. Why aren't I? he wondered as he splashed cold water on his face inside a restroom in a half hearted attempt to stay awake.He knew this was supposed to be the biggest day of his life, but somehow he didn't feel it. For some reason he didn't really feel anything but tired and bored and irritated.”Mr Watson?” John looked up.”It's doctor Watson.”If he knew that doctor's name he would've called him mister and made him know what that felt like, but he had forgotten it.”She's just out of surgery”, the doctor said. ”It was touch and go for a while, but she pulled through. She's still asleep though.”John wanted to be angry that they hadn't told him that it was serious, that they hadn't told him that his wife could've died and he could've become a widow with a child. He wanted to be, but he wasn't.”Baby's doing alright as well”, the doctor continued. ”It's a girl.” It's a girl , John repeated in his head, hoping that it would mean something more the second time. It didn't. Maybe he just needed some time to take it all in and realize that it was real. Maybe he just needed some sleep.”Do you want to see her?”John was comfortable in his chair and he really didn't feel like doing any more walking with that bag on his shoulder after getting so little sleep, but he didn't think no would be a sufficient or appropiate answer in that situation. He nodded and followed the doctor. He still couldn't remember his name.”Have you thought about any names?” he asked as they walked.They had, hadn't they? Of course they had. Maybe they had even settled on something. John couldn't remember. He probably hadn't been listening at all.”Not really”, he said.He looked at her through the glass and tried to think of a name. But she didn't look like a Susan, Jane or Evelyn. She didn't look like anything, she looked like a baby. She didn't even look like his baby, like his daughter. She looked just like all the other babies. Her forehead was a little big, mind. But there was nothing special about her apart from that. Was there supposed to be? John wondered if he could ask the doctor that, if he was supposed to see something or feel something. If she was supposed to be more than just another baby, if he was supposed to love her unconditionally now even though he had never met her and didn't know her at all. Maybe he wouldn't even like her. He decided that he couldn't ask the doctor that, not after he had called him Mr Watson.He also decided that he couldn't ask him if it was normal to hallucinate when your wife is having a c-section. Because when he had sat at the café, just before the doctor came to get him, he had been certain he had seen someone. He had been certain he had seen a man with brown, curly hair and a dark, long coat turn around the corner. And before the doctor had called him Mr Watson he was going to stand up, leave the bag and run after him, and never come back. ",Life in colour,21241

Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","Amanda Watson was a year old. She could sit up without support, she could crawl, she could stand up and take a few waddling steps, she could make incoherent noises and she could laugh for five minutes straight at things that weren't even funny. When she was in the mood, that is. Because she could also become so furious that her entire face turned red, and she could scream loud enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood if she felt like it.What she could not do, was keep her father happy. She could not make him smile a genuine smile, she could not make him love her, she could not make him dream about her. Not that it is the child's responsibility to do all that, but it is something most tend to do anyway.John Watson was an exception. He didn't dislike his daughter, because who can dislike a baby? He thought she was very cute and when she was happy he was too. If he ever had to, he would probably die for her. If he had that option, that is. Then he probably would. But he would die before any child, and that was the problem. To him Amanda was like any other child. He still waited for that connection, that adoration, that love, that was bound to come one day. But it never did. She wasn't anything special, nothing special at all. Just another baby, a baby that screamed and pooped and laughed. One that admittedly lived in his home and had been taken out of his wife's uterus, but that was everything that separated her from the babies of friends or strangers on the street. Sometimes John looked at her, just looked at her, and waited for everything to change, for the penny to drop. She just gurgled and he smiled at her. The penny didn't drop, nothing ever changed.He had expected everything to change, he had expected everything to get better when she was born. But it never did. He was still as bored as he had been before. Every day was monotone and horrible, and he stared out the window and looked at all the people and wondered how they did it. They didn't look bored, not like him. He was restless and he could never decide if he wanted to run or stand up and scream out into nothing and never stop. Everything was the same, everything was boring. He wanted to do something, anything, anything. He was so bored, and it never changed.It took him months to stop looking through the papers, looking for his name. He never saw it. He saw Lestrade's every once in a while and wondered if Sherlock had helped him with that case. He wondered how it had happened, he tried to imagine how he had solved the crime. But he never saw as much as a mention of Sherlock Holmes, and soon enough Greg Lestrade couldn't be found either. And eventually John stopped. He stopped searching the papers, he stopped hoping that he would find him there, because he never did. He had never thought himself to be the type to give up easily, but then again, he had never thought himself to be the type to obsess over a consulting detective he had met a handful of times, not more than he had thought that he would dream about his cheekbones at night.Maybe that meant that if things doesn't change then at least people do. Maybe that would put his mind at ease at one point. But Mary hadn't changed. She was just as impeccably perfect as she had been when he had first set eyes on her behind the reception desk and the world had exploded in front of him. She still bored the hell out of him with her talk about playdates and a possible sibling to Amanda. (And John didn't want a sibling for Amanda. The night she was born had been one of the most boring in his life and he didn't want to repeat it again. He didn't think Mary would agree to let him stay home while she gave birth either, so that was out of question.) He tried to dodge her and stay at work for as long as possible every day, but it didn't always work.The best way for him to dodge her and at the same time relieve the worst boredom if only temporarily, would be to take the tube to Baker Street. He almost did too, several times. But he always stopped himself in the last minute. Because he had a feeling that if he did go there, if he did try it, then he wouldn't be able to get enough. Then he would never be able to go back to his normal boring life again, then he would never come back. And as much as he didn't want to go back, he didn't want to abandon his family either. Because boring or not, that was what Mary and Amanda was for him. He had made a commitment, he had signed up for that for life. He couldn't leave them like that, he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he did. He would have nightmares about that too, he knew it.He had a lot of nightmares at this point. They had been gone for months after he had met Mary and they had gotten married, but they had come back when she was pregnant. Slowly, first only glimpses and occasional screams, but gradually they had gotten longer and more detailed. They were always about the war, about people dying and bombs and gunshots and everything else. They were horrid, gruesome, violent and bloody, but that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was that they were all in black and white. The colours hadn't been there yet, and in the dreams they were gone. That made him panic more than anything else, that was the worst. He couldn't see any colours at all, but he could remember them. He knew they were out there and he knew how they looked, but he couldn't see them. He was aware of them, but they weren't there. He had had the colours and then he had lost them, and that was worse than everything.***They met again on the street by chance. Well, chance and chance. How many times is it chance? How many times can you call it chance before you need to face that it's something else? That, maybe, it's faith? John Watson didn't really believe in faith, but he hadn't believed in the colours either, and yet when he saw him he could see that Sherlock Holmes had dark brown hair and a dark blue coat.”Sherlock?” he called out through the crowd.He didn't speak loudly and he shouldn't have heard him, but he still turned around. They stared at each other as people passed them by. John couldn't say a word.AWhat is happening? Ahe thought. AWhat is happening?AIt felt like the world was still and the eath didn't spin, it felt like all the noise was muffled, everything except Sherlock was blurry and all the colours were suddenly clearer. They were clearer, so much clearer, so much more beautiful. They looked like they had done the first time he saw them, before they had gotten normal and everyday. They looked like they were still extraordinary, like they were still miracles. John forgot to breathe for a few seconds there.Sherlock opened his mouth, but it took a while before any sounds escaped it.”John”, he said eventually.His voice seemed deeper, more hoarse and almost threatened to break. John suddenly realized that it wasn't just his voice that was different. He didn't look at all like he had done the last time they met, when he had been dashingly handsome with high cheekbones, clear skin, healthy hair and lively eyes. He looked tired, almost drained. His skin had a yellowish tone to it, his face was a bit greasy and his hair even more, it was worn and torn and looked like he hadn't washed it in ages. He was thinner too, on the brink of alarmingly skinny. His cheeks were slumped and his skull was prominent. His eyes were watered and red and almost seemed dead, almost seemed to not see anything. He looked like he had gone through hell, he looked like he had lived for hundreds of years and was done.”What the hell happened to you?” John asked.Sherlock smiled lightly and chuckled but sounded more like he coughed or cleared his throat.”Are you sick?”Sherlock still smiled, but it was small and strained and there was no joy in his eyes, only sorrow.”In a way”, he replied.He sounded done as well, like he was just finished, like he had given up. He put both hands in his pockets and once again it strook John how different he was. When he had met him he had been vibrant, excited, confident and full of life. He had been strutting, waving his arms and signing with his hands. Now, he was still. He didn't move at all except for when he tried to smile or his face twitched. His back had been straight but was now crooked, and he looked smaller. He looked like a little boy more than a grown man, like a lost little boy without any idea where to go next. John just wanted to wrap his arms around him and guide him and make everything okay, but he didn't know how. He didn't know. He just didn't know.”Are you on a case?” he asked instead.”No”, Sherlock said. ”I haven't had any cases in a while.”John thought that was weird. What else did he do, if he didn't have cases? He couldn't imagine Sherlock Holmes as anything but a consulting detective, couldn't believe that he would be pleased doing anything else. If John could have that life and those cases, then he would never stop, he would never be pleased with something else, everything would be inferior. He couldn't understand why he would stop taking cases, because he was so good at it too. Unless...John shuddered. Because what if he hadn't given it up willingly? What if he had been forced to stop?”Why?” he asked, because he needed to know. He couldn't take not knowing anymore, he needed to know exactly why Sherlock wasn't doing what he usually did.For a moment the other man was silent and completely still. He didn't make any movements – John could swear he didn't even blink – and he didn't show any facial expressions. John thought he hadn't heard him at all, until he finally spoke.”I've been away”, he said.That wasn't enough for John.”Where?” he asked. ”A hospital?”Sherlock breathed out.”Sort of”, he mumbled, and lowered his eyes.John looked down too, and he noticed how Sherlock's hands were shaking even through the pockets. He thought about how bad he looked and how his face twitched. Sort of, he had said. He looked down at the ground like he was ashamed. John took a few seconds, then it suddenly hit him.”Jesus”, he exclaimed, before he had thought it through, before he had realized that he shouldn't have.Sherlock immediately tensed up entirely and John could see how he closed every possibility of further conversation.”I-I should go”, he stuttered under his breath.He refused to look up at him as he hurried away, and John couldn't think fast enough to say anything to him.He looked as the detective disappeared into the crowd and tried to make sense of it, tried to understand what it meant. It was obvious now, but he didn't know what to do with it.ARehab, Ahe thought. ASherlock Holmes has been to rehab.AHe never would have guessed that he was a junkie. No, not him. Not Sherlock Holmes. He had been so perfect, so bloody perfect. He hadn't had any flaws or weaknesses, none at all. But then he was a drug addict. Then he didn't wash his hair for weeks and his fingers shook. Then he probably had an arm full of holes after a syringe.It was hard for John to think of him like that, high and passed out in a corner, both blind and deaf to the outside world. It was even harder to imagine him at rehab, dressed all in white and dragging his slipper-clad feet behind him through white and neutral corridors. It was impossible to see him on a therapist's couch, pouring his heart out and saying things John couldn't even fathom.To him that wasn't Sherlock Holmes. To him Sherlock Holmes was strong and confident and caught the bad guys and saved the day. To him Sherlock Holmes' entire life was a giant adventure and he did more good for the world every week than John had done in his entire life. To him Sherlock Holmes was anything but weak, tired and addicted to drugs. But whether he liked it or not, that was Sherlock Holmes. The real one, the one he had just met. Without the cases and the deductions and the smartass comments he wasn't a consulting detective. He was just a lonely scared little boy without anywhere to go or anywhere to turn to, lost in life and desperately in need of an anchar. Because without it he would drift off to sea and no one would ever see him again. ",Life in colour,21241

Unless you're lucky enough to meet your soulmate, that is.<br />John Watson is one of the lucky ones, apart from the fact that his wife isn't who she says she is. And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","John didn't have a plan. He didn't plan to call in sick, and he never meant to make his way to Baker Street. It was weird, because it just sort of happened. He didn't plan to do any of that, he just did.He hadn't slept a wink. He had been tired, close to exhausted, but he hadn't been able to stop thinking about Sherlock. He hadn't been able to get the image of his face out of his head or stop hearing his weak voice.AI've been away.AHe had to do it. He had to go. He had to save him, or at least try. Try until his fingers bled and there was nothing left to do if it got that far. He had to. He stopped outside of 221B and stared at the door. He had to, but he knew that if he did there was no going back. There would be no more regular, boring evening dinners, there would be no diaper changes. Everything would change. He wouldn't be able to go back. Mary wouldn't understand it, but she would have to accept it. Because he had to do it, whatever it meant.His hand was shaking by the time he had gathered enough strength to reach forward and press the button for the doorbell. He could hear it ring inside, but no one came to the door.John stood there. He didn't have a plan. He had really thought that Sherlock would open, he had been certain that he would get further than to the goddamn door. Instead he was left out on the street looking like a complete doofus. He had called in sick. He hissed. But he pressed the button again, just in case. Because there was really nothing else to do.Suddenly he heard banging inside, someone rushing down the stairs. The door was unlocked and flung open, almost in his face. He had to take a step back and almost fell backwards.”Christ!” he yelled.Sherlock looked like a different person. He had washed his hair and he was dressed in a black suit. He appeared to be vibrant and full of life again. He was absolutely fine. John couldn't help but feel a little angry. There he was, trying to save him. He had called in sick from work and he never did that. To save him, when he didn't even need saving.”I'm so sorry!” Sherlock exclaimed. ”I was expecting a client, I- would you like to come upstairs?”That was what he needed. Not John. A client, a case. Not John. That would save him. Not John.But it wasn't about saving Sherlock anymore. It wasn't about that, maybe it had never been. Maybe it had been just a little about it, maybe not at all. Because it was about John. He wanted to save himself. Sherlock didn't need him, he could see that, but he needed him. He needed the cases and the criminals, the thrill, the blood pumping through his veins. Maybe it had been about that all along. But he wanted to come upstairs.”Sure”, he said.He was actually being selfish. He actually didn't care.He followed Sherlock up the stairs. It was as if he was trying to walk slower than he wanted to, as if he actually wanted to take two steps at a time but tried his hardest to hold back so he wouldn't run away from John. But if he had been alone or if it had been anyone else, he would have rushed up those stairs, taken it all in a big giant leap and be done with it.Just as he stopped outside the door to his flat and signed for John to go in first, the doorbell rang again. For a second Sherlock looked confused, almost close to panic, so unprepared was he and so clueless as to what he should do. But then collected himself, told John that he wouldn't be long and practically jumped down the stairs like a child excited for Christmas.AClient, AJohn thought. AThat's what he needs.AHe went inside, and for the first time he actually looked at the flat. It was crowded, but not because it was too small but because it was filled with stuff. Not normal stuff normal people had in their normal apartments, but John hadn't expected that either. He wasn't surprised over all the rubbish there was. A robe thrown over the armrest on the couch, too many pillows in a chair that looked otherwise comfortable, a skull – which John thought might very well be real, knowing Sherlock Holmes – over the fireplace, a violin on top of all the paper and documents on the coffee table, a sword on the wall, a letter opener and an actual pipe. John wanted to ask him if he actually smoked it, because it didn't look like it was for decoration. Nothing looked like it was for decoration, not even the half-finished painting in a corner. John would never had guessed that Sherlock painted, but it was quite nice. It was a tree in the middle of a glade or meadow. That seemed like a very boring and surprising motive for a man like Sherlock, maybe that's why he had never finished it. John couldn't see any paint or paintbrushes anywhere either. What he could see was a jar containing what appeared to be eyes. Not that it shocked him.Footsteps were coming back up the stairs, Sherlock's long and fast ones followed by some that were slow and quiet, almost dragging across the floor and only lifting when absolutely necessary. They belonged to a young woman, early to mid twenties, it was hard to tell. She wasn't pretty. Her hair was greasy and thin and of a boring colour, like someone in the sky hadn't managed to decide whether to make it blonde or brown. She had a pale complexion, sharp cheek, pointy nose, thin lips and an overbite. Her eyes were grey, small and pointed downwards. And then there was the way she moved, like a timid, grey mouse, her hands clutched together and her steps small and quiet. She had poor posture too, and a strange look on her face. Her entire being looked like she would much rather sink into the ground or blend in with the wall than be noticed or heard.”Please, sit”, Sherlock said and signed towards a kitchen chair he had placed by the coffee table, probably for that very occasion and purpose.He threw some of the pillows from the other chair into the kitchen and John sat down in it, while he himself positioned himself in the couch. Seconds earlier he had been all over the place, shaking with excitement and almost bursting of anticipation. But now he slumped together, placed one leg carelessly over the other and looked bored. John thought it odd, but then that was the case with a lot of things that had to do with Sherlock.”So”, the detective said. ”Tell us the story. From the beginning.”ANo introductions here, AJohn thought.AAThe young woman seemed to think the same thing, because she looked confused at him and squeezed her hands together even harder.A”Well”, she started, and her voice was as weak and insignificant as the rest of her but she didn't look down at the ground but held eye contact with Sherlock. ”It all started a few months ago, when I met this guy. I'm at the hospital quite a lot, I have diagnoses.”AShe twisted in her chair and blushed a bit.A”So I know a lot of people there”, she continued. ”And one of them, she introduced me to a friend of hers. Friend or relative- I can't remember. But he was handsome, and he laughed at my jokes. He seemed interested, and not a lot of men are interested in me. Well, not in that way at least.”AShe laughed awkwardly, and John smiled so she wouldn't feel bad.A”Not going into details”, she said. ”But we spent a lot of time together. Went on dates, stuff like that. We had- we had fun. He made me happy, I really liked him.””How about colours?” Sherlock suddenly interrupted. ”Did you see the colours?””No?” the woman said. ”I don't- I've heard people say they don't always happen, or not always direct. If-””But no colours?” Sherlock asked again.”No”, she replied.”Go on then”, he said.AShe took a deep breath.A”Then he disappeared”, she said. ”He didn't say anything, didn't leave anything, nothing. He was just gone. His phone had been disconnected, his lease had been terminated. He was just gone.”AJohn didn't want to have to break it to her that she had been dumped. She didn't look like she had had many boyfriends and she talked about this guy as if he was the most important thing in her life, but she just didn't see the facts. He had left her. And John couldn't blame him, because he would had gone mad within a week with that woman.A”No trace at all?” Sherlock asked.AHe started looking interested again, leaning forward slightly and putting a hand under his cheek.A”None”, the woman said. ”I've- I've checked death notices. He's not there either.””The picture?”AShe reached into a pocket of the expensive looking coat she hadn't taken off and took out a picture that she laid down on the coffee table in front of her. The man on it was not what John had expected. He was closer to them than her in age, and he was Ahandsome. ABlond and blue eyed with a striking smile. He looked fit and all features worked well with each other, not at all like hers. A”That's him”, she said and smiled lightly. ”Sebastian Moran.”ASherlock stared at his face, bent forward and with his cheek in his hands. He didn't say a word for a long time, so John eventually felt forced to say something, anything.A”Do you think there is any chance he's gone-” he tried to say it as gently as possible, ”away by his own accord?”AShe shook her head frantically.A”Never!” she exclaimed. ”He would say, he would tell me!””Did you pay something for him?” John suggested. ”Or did he take something before he went?””No!” she protested. ”Nothing at all.””I'm keeping this”, Sherlock said and simply took the picture before its owner could protest. ”I think that's all I need.”AHe stood up and reached out his hand. She looked around confused, but got up too and shook it. A”So you're taking my case?” she asked.”I already have”, he replied.AJohn got up and shook her hand as well, and then she walked out the door and down the stairs by herself. Sherlock was done with being polite and acting as a host.A”Why are we taking her case?” John asked, once he had heard the front door slam and knew that she was out on the street and couldn't possibly hear it. ”He's obviously left her, he's not disappeared or anything.”AFor a few seconds, Sherlock just stared at him. John couldn't read him at all, he just stared at him.A”We”, he said quietly, almost too quietly for John to hear.”What?” he asked and furrowed a brow.”We?” Sherlock said and cleared his throat. ”You said we.”AJohn tried to smile, but he got scared. Scared that Sherlock wouldn't let him help, that he wouldn't want him on the case. That he would have to get back to Mary and Amanda and live the rest of his life the exactly same way, boring and predictable.A”I suppose I did”, he said.AThen Sherlock smiled. He didn't smirk, he actually smiled. Not a large one, but one that was a lot more sincere and honest than anyone John had ever seen him smile before.A”Does this mean that you're in?” he asked.”If you allow it”, John replied, and he couldn't help but feel a smile of his own starting to grow.”There's more to the story”, Sherlock suddenly said. ”That woman we just met, her name is Abigail Windsor.”AJohn had to take a moment to think out a reply after the sudden change of conversation, but quickly found that he recognized the name.A”As in, Alastair Windsor?””Exactly!””Banker of sorts?””Close”, Sherlock said. ”He owns a bank.”AA light bulb lit up in John's head.A”She's rich”, he stated. ”But she never paid for anything for him, and he didn't steal anything.””That's because he didn't have to.”ASuddenly he understood.A”It hasn't been robbed, has it?” he asked.AA bank robbery! Ahe thought.AAThat was even more exciting than a murder, and not many things were.A”Not yet”, Sherlock said with a smirk. ”But I think it might be soon.”AJohn was in. He was so in.AA***AAMary peeled potatoes. She was good at it, he could give her that. She was fast at peeling potatoes, but it was still Apeeling potatoes. AIt was still boring. And what he did was even more boring. He stirred the sauce. That was so boring that he wanted to stick his head in it and cook himself alive.A”Something happened today”, he said.AHe didn't want to tell her. He didn't know why, but he really didn't want to. Still he had to, he knew he did. She was his wife so she had to know. He couldn't call in sick every day, he would have to be with Sherlock after work and stay out late. So he really didn't have an option.A”Oh?” she said.AShe didn't sound interested at all. She was good at faking interest, but he knew her now.AAHe took a deep breath. He had to do it.A”I met Sherlock Holmes”, he said.AShe stopped for a second, stared straight ahead of her and blinked twice.A”Really?” she said.”Yeah”, John said. ”I'm-”AWas it even that bad? He didn't feel like it was, so he had no idea why he felt that it was so horrible to tell her. Did he expect her to be angry or lash out? Did he expect her to suddenly decide to peel off his skin instead? He didn't. He didn't expect anything, but the words wouldn't come to him.A”I'm going to help him with another case”, he said.AShe kept peeling the potatoes. There was something strange about her, something that made him think that he should expect Asomething Aafter all.A”Why?” she asked.”I dunno”, he said. ”I suppose I could be helpful.””No offence, John”, she said. ”But you're a doctor. What could you be helpful for?”AHe sighed. AThat's Awhat he should have expected.A”I dunno”, he said again. ”I'm just gonna help him, that's all.””Is that so wise?” she asked. ”You've got work, we've got Amanda.”AI know, he thought. And both those things makes me want to kill myself.”I won't be out all day”, he sneered. ”I'll just lend him a hand from time to time.”He planned on doing a lot more than that, he wanted to do a lot more than that, he needed to do a lot more than that. But if that's what he had to say, then he would say it.”Alright then”, she said. ”Can I at least know what it's about?”That felt even worse to tell her, and he didn't have to. He wouldn't. He wouldn't say anything. He didn't know why, but he could definitely not say a word.”No”, he said, and tried a smile to make it into a joke and not so serious. ”It's a secret.”Amanda started crying in the room on the other side of the wall. For the first time ever, John was grateful for her.”I'll get her”, he said.He left the sauce to care for itself and ran off the fastest he could, before she could protest any further. He hoped that when he got back she would have forgotten all about it and that they would never have to talk about it again, and the problem would be solved.As he left the room Mary stopped peeling and stared at him. There was something dark in her eyes and her grip around the peeler tightened.But he didn't notice, because he held his daughter and looked into her eyes. For the first time, he felt something. Within those blue eyes there was something. He smiled. ",Life in colour,21241

And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","The only reason John went home after work was that Sherlock didn't expect him yet and he didn't want to seem clingy or eager. But he would much rather had been there than at his own place, and it almost physically hurt him to open the door.”Hello?” he shouted.No one replied because Mary was painting the walls in Amanda's room, that she had began to call the nursery after she had started talking about that second child.”Wow”, John said. ”It's very... green.”Mary stared down at her brush for a few seconds, as if the paint had been a completely different colour when she had used it.”You don't like it?” she asked and looked at him.”It's not bad”, he said, and he wasn't lying. He liked all colours, after all he hadn't seen them for the biggest part of his life. ”I just thought we settled on yellow.”He was actually sure they had. Colours were the only thing he really payed attention to and he had taken part in the planning. Well, he had pointed at the yellow and almost shouted at her that it was the one.”Oh, right”, Mary said and squeezed the paintbrush a little. ”They were out.”John looked at the wall she was finished with.”I didn't want to wait for the delivery.”Green wasn't all that bad.”It's okay though,” she stated more than asked. ”Isn't it?””Yeah”, John said. ”It's fine.”He put an arm her waist and kissed her on the cheek. She groaned slightly. She was like that when she was busy, didn't want him to interrupt.”I need to go see Sherlock.””Really?” Mary said. ”I thought you said it wasn't every day?””It's not”, John sighed. ”But it's this day.”He said both hello and goodbye to his daughter who was sleeping in her crib and then he rushed off to get the tube to Baker Street and solve a bank robbery.***Sherlock opened the door before he had even rang the bell. He poked out his head and looked to both sides before turning around and running up the stairs.”I need to show you something!” he shouted, and John followed him up.Two and a half years earlier he would not have gotten up those stairs that fast, not with his limp and his cane. Now he was practically bouncing up, after Sherlock, after adventures.”What is it?” he asked eagerly.Sherlock turned a laptop on the coffee table towards John and he sat down in the same chair where he had sat the day before. On the screen was an ID – a driver's license – for the man they were looking for, Sebastian Moran.”Where'd you get this?” John asked.”Brother in the government”, Sherlock said and waved it off with his right hand. ”I've got more too.”John stared at Moran's piercing blue eyes and wondered why he felt like he recognized him, while Sherlock paced the room and rubbed his hands together.”He's an orphan”, he explained. ”Parents died in a car crash when he was eight, he grew up at an orphanage. Might have been a victim of sexual assault, I don't know, but I don't want to rule out the possibility just yet.”Moran's eyes were staring right at John, right into his soul.”How ghastly”, he said.”Indeed”, Sherlock agreed with a neutral voice. ”He dropped out of school when he was 16, took some odd jobs. Joined the army eventually, and this is where it gets exciting.”He looked positively delighted, but John felt a bit cold. He rubbed a hand against his arm and continued to look at Sebastian Moran, continued to try and see him as a poor little orphan boy without anything or anyone. But it was hard, as soulless and cruel he looked. His eyes had no compassion in them at all.”He became a sniper”, Sherlock continued. ”A bloody good one too. He shipped off to Afghanistan as the best in his platoon, a few years before you got there. He was still there when you came, and by then he was the absolute best, no one could compete with him.”AThat's it, AJohn thought. AThat's why I know him, I must have met him in Afghanistan.A”But there was a slight problem. The men from his platoon were scared of him. They said he was too careless, too emotionless and not enough compassionate.”He scoffed as if it was ridicilous to think of those traits as bad qualities. John wasn't surprised though. He was a bit scared himself just looking at his picture.”Of course those with the power didn't take notice, they thought it was good even, I would assume. That is, until he killed a boy.””He did what?” John asked.Sherlock stared at him with an amused smirk on his face.”Killed a boy”, he replied. ”He was ten, Moran shot him right in the head when he was going home from school. No one could believe it was an accident, there wasn't a battle and he was the best. He never missed.”John realized what the thing in his eyes was. It was the complete lack of compassion and respect for human life. Those were the eyes of a man that had shot a ten year old boy in the head and killed him.”Why'd he do it?””He said he freed him.””From what?”Sherlock shrugged his shoulders.”From life, I suppose.”John shuddered.”Anyway”, the detective continued. ”They sent him home. He hasn't had a legal source of income since, but I didn't think this was a first either.””What do you think he's been doing?” John asked and looked into the eyes of the killer.”Nothing nice”, Sherlock said.He was looking out the window now, the palms of his hands against each other and his fingers against his chin. He was nowhere near as bad as he had been when John had ran into him on the street two days earlier, he didn't need to be fixed anymore. But it was John's turn to be fixed now.”What do we do now?” he asked.”What do you think we should do now?” Sherlock counter asked.John furrowed his brows and tried to think, tried to reason like the master detective even though he knew he could never do it half as good. At first it seemed like there were no options at all, nothing to do whatsoever. Then suddenly there were lots of options, way too many, and he couldn't for his life figure out which ones were bad and which ones were good, which ones to try and which ones to dismiss completely. It was hard, solving probable bank robberies. But still not as hard as painting the nursery green with Mary.”We could talk some more to Abigail Windsor”, he suggested after a few moments of careful consideration.He didn't exactly want to meet that bleak, grey mouse with weak voice again, but it was a logical move to make and could gain them more information.”Yes”, Sherlock said and hummed. ”That is a good idea. But unforunately not a possibility.””Why not?” John asked.He had screwed up again. He wasn't good at being a detective and solving crimes.”Because Abigail was killed last night”, Sherlock said.”What?””Technically she died from a heroin overdose, but she didn't use and it's a too big of a coincidence that she would suddenly decide to the day she meets with me, don't you think?”John nodded. It did seem unlikely.”So, you're thinking-” he started.”I'm thinkin that our friend Moran paid his old beau a visit and convinced her to 'have a good time',” Sherlock said.Sebastian Moran had killed a ten year old boy in Afghanistan, of course he could have killed Abigail Windsor in her fancy apartment. John should have felt scared, but he didn't. He only felt exhillerated, excited, ready to go, willing to do anything. He certainly wasn't bored.”Then what?” he asked. ”The bank?””Hm”, Sherlock mumbled, got back from his place by the window and started digging in his couch for something. ”Not yet.”He fished up a black, unnoticeable wallet that appeared strikinly dull to belong to him, and waved it in front of John with a smile.”First we're going to the hospital.””Hospital?” John asked.”Abigail's hospital”, Sherlock explained. ”Where she met the woman that introduced her to Moran.””You think she's got anything to do with this?””I think”, the detective smirked, ”that they didn't meet by chance.”John smiled.”You're awfully sure.””Nothing ever happens by chance”, Sherlock said, ”does it?”John thought about it. He supposed he was right.”So he's not alone in this?” John asked. ”You think there are more people involved.”Sherlock sneered.”No one robs a bank on their own, John.”John didn't know much about bank robberies, but when he thought about it he hadn't ever read about one that someone had performed on their own. It made it all the more exciting, that there were more people like Moran out there. Complicated, but exciting.”You're coming with, aren't you?” Sherlock asked as he grabbed his coat from the hanger by the door.John stared at Sebastian Moran one last time and tried to remember when he could have possibly met him. He knew he recognized those eyes, but he couldn't place them anywhere.”Of course I am”, he replied.***They got a cab and Sherlock gave the driver an address that John didn't catch. The radio was on, but it was too quiet for them to actually hear the song. All John could hear was the rhythm and humming, not enough to make out what song it was.”If Abigail's dead”, he began. ”Then who are you doing it for?”Sherlock furrowed a brow as he looked out the window.”Well, for me”, he replied. ”Something to do, a case. I don't do it for the money.””Of course not”, John said. ”But, I mean, why not take on a new case and help another client? One that is actually alive?”Sherlock chuckled as if the idea was absolutely ridicilous.”There's still a bank out to get robbed”, he explained. ”I suppose my client is Alistair Windsor now, then.”John nodded in understanding even though he wasn't looking his way. He tried to listen to what the song was. You're in my... Veins? He listened even harder, just because he had nothing else to do.AAnd I can not get you outAThe cab stopped. Sherlock payed while John got out and saw what hospital they were outside of.”It's my hospital”, he said. ”Why didn't you say we were going to St Bart's?””Didn't I?”Sherlock walked past him and pulled up his collar.”You might want to stay outside”, he spoke as he walked towards the entrance. ”I'm going to be questioning your colleagues.””So this was Abigail's hospital?” John asked. ”This is where she met that woman that introduced her to Moran?””Obviously.”John sighed. But he didn't really mind waiting outside, it would be difficult to explain to everyone the day after. Why he had been going around with an amateur detective that suspected them of shady businesses. So he parked himself at a bench and waited.The sun started to disappear and it the world got darker, it was autumn. Leaves were blowing in the wind and John started freezing.”Christ”, he said after half an hour.Sherlock was probably not coming back out anytime soon.John suddenly found himself very aware that inside that very building, Abigail had met the person that would seal her faith, and because of her she was dead all too young. And inside that same building John had met Sherlock, wearing the same coat he was wearing that day. In there he had seen his first colours, in there he had met M-”Oh no”, he said out loud to no one in particular, because the street was empty and he was alone.He had met Mary there, when she had been the receptionist, when she had worked there.AIs that so wise? Ashe had asked.AABut that couldn't be. It couldn't possibly be.AABefore John could think any more of it, Sherlock burst out the door and John flew up on his feet.A”Aren't you cold?” Sherlock asked and started waving for a cab.”Did you find her?” John asked.AHe hoped and prayed that he had, that it was someone else. He would give anything for it to be someone else, and that Sherlock had found her.AABut Sherlock hadn't found her.A”I think she quit long ago”, he said as a cab pulled up beside them. ”But I had expected that.”AShe had quit long ago. John was cold down to his bones and his arm was stiff when he opened the cab door.AAReally?AAJohn tried to breathe but it was hard, suddenly everything was hard. It started blurring before his eyes.AAGod no, Ahe thought. AIt can't be.ABut it could be, and he knew it. He could feel it. He hoped he wasn't right, he hoped it wasn't true. But deep down...”Where to?” said the cab driver.He sounded too jolly for John. He wasn't supposed to be happy, not when something like that was happening.He thought about Mary when she had killed that bird, and he thought about her frozen and silent at the kitchen counter with the potato peeler in her hand.ACan I at least know what it's about?ABefore Sherlock could say anything John had given the driver his address.Because nothing ever happens by chance. ",Life in colour,21241

And the mysterious man that he just can't get out his head, or his life.","Sherlock was waiting outside, he leaned against the wall and looked at John when he walked up the steps to the front door. As if he understood, like he understood anything at all. He couldn't possibly know what it felt like.John could hear his own heart beating, steady and calm even though he wasn't. He tried to contain himself and breathe, but it was hard. Everything was hard. The world had a tone of grey to it, he was moving in slow motion and there was a pounding in his head.Mary was standing in the kithen, rocking Amanda against her chest and humming quietly.”John?” she said.She could see that something was wrong, she was a lot of things but stupid wasn't one of them. John clenched and unclenched his fists and stared at her, to see if he could see anything there. Sometimes he had seen it, the darkness in her eyes and the aggressiveness in her movements. But he couldn't see it at all now, when she was rocking their baby girl to sleep and humming her a lullaby.”Tell me”, he said.Her careful smile didn't fade at all, she only tilted her head a little in confusion.”Tell you what?” ske asked.Her voice was so soft. He had fallen asleep to that voice, with his head on that chest and those hands in his hair. Something was wrong, something is very wrong with a world where that can happen.”Everything”, he said. ”Everything.”He wasn't even scared of her. He was married to her, she had given birth to his child. It was hard to be scared of her, to think of the things she could be capable of. Not after he had seen her jump around the kitchen in only her pants, singing a show tune while cooking him pancakes.”What are you talking about?” she asked.Now she stopped smiling, now she looked angry and irritated. And tired. Like he had asked her stuff like that every day and she was sick of it, like it was only nagging.”I'm talking about the Windsor bank!” he shouted and banged his fist at the table. ”I'm talking about Abigail Windsor who's bloody dead now!”She sighed. Who was she even? Who only sighed when he confronted her about a dead girl? Who was just aggitated and tired that he was asking questions?”So”, she said, still rocking the baby in her arms. ”What do you want to know?”John wanted to know a lot of things. He wanted to know if she had known, when she had introduced her to Moran. He wanted to know if she would have been able to stop it if she had wanted to. He wanted to know how she could sleep at night with that on her conscience and how she could rock their one year old baby with all that blood on her hands.”Did you introduce her to Moran?” he asked.She looked at him for a second.”Yes”, she replied.She sounded too neutral, too indifferent. Like she didn't care at all.”And that's why you worked at the hospital?” John continued.His wife rolled her eyes at him.”Yes”, she repeated.He stared at her. She stared back. Something was starting to show in her eyes. A bit of understanding, a little compassion, perhaps some humanity.”It was part of the plan”, she said. ”But you were never part of the plan, okay? I wasn't supposed to date you, but I fell in love with you.”Amanda started moving in her arms.”That's true, John. I love you.”He heard her loud and clear, even though his heart was beating so loudly. He remembered her smile on their wedding day, the faint sound of her soft voice when she said 'I do'. But he also remembered the darkness in her eyes, he remembered the day when she had killed that bird.AI put it out of it's misery, Ashe had said.AAI freed him, ASebastian Moran had said.ABut not about a wounded and probably dying bird, but about a boy. A living, breathing, feeling boy with an entire life ahead of him, that he had shot in the head and killed. John couldn't help but wonder what she had done, if she had ever done anything like that. If she had done anything worse.”Please forgive me”, she begged him.Tears started escaping her eyes and rolling down her cheeks.”Please, John. I love you.”He exhaled. He exhaled again. His head was pounding, he couldn't think. It was empty up there, no emotions or thoughts. Just emptiness.”Sherlock's outside”, he said.She nodded. Her lips were shaking.”You have to help us with this.”She nodded again.”Anything”, she said. ”I'll do anything if you give me another chance, anything.”But John didn't want anything from her now. Nothing at all.***They sat down around the kitchen table, Sherlock positioned beside John and Mary on the other side. Amanda was still over her shoulder and she was patting her back gently.”So”, she said.”So”, Sherlock repeated.She looked at him, even though John was staring right at her. Trying to figure out who she was, trying to find out if he knew her. He wasn't sure he did, wasn't sure at all.”The bank”, Sherlock said. ”The Windsor bank. It will get robbed, won't it?”Mary nodded her head slowly. Amanda started crying.”Yes”, Mary answered. ”Yes, it will.”She turned her head and looked at her daughter with tears in her eyes. John still couldn't see the motherly love in them.APoor child, Ahe thought. AA father that doesn't love you and a mother like that.AA mother that had killed the wounded bird without flinching. A mother that had sighed when he had asked her about a murder that she was involved in. The death of a young girl who was bleak and grey but had done nothing wrong in her short life.APoor child, AJohn thought.AAHe didn't even know if he meant Amanda or Abigail anymore.A”How does Moran and Abigail fit into all this?” Sherlock asked. ”How do you?”AHe was calm and relaxed, cool and professional. John wanted to punch him right in his smug face and sharp cheekbones.A”Abigail was just one way in, to get close”, Mary said as she placed her forehead on her daughter's and tried to smile at her. ”But we found another, easier one, and we let her go.”ASherlock snickered.A”Do you want me to believe that for 'just one way in' you took on a new job and Moran dated a girl for months?” he said with an amused smile at his lips. ”Do you think I'm that stupid?”AMary sighed. She looked at John for half a second, before she directed her attention towards the detective again and stared at him in a way John thought not many had dared to do.A”You don't understand”, she said. ”This is big, bigger than you think. He has hundreds of people, everywhere, doing everything, covering all possibilities. The bank isn't even all he's got going on right now, it's just a small part of it.”ASuddenly the detective tensed up and straightened his back.A”You said he”, he said. ”Who's he?”AJohn didn't care who he was, didn't want to solve the crime anymore. He didn't give a shit about the bank robbery, he didn't even give a shit about Abigail Windsor or Sebastian Moran. All he cared about in that moment was Mary, his wife, the mother of his child, the colours of his world. Who had lied to him every day he had known her. If he ever actually had known her.A”Jim Moriarty”, she said. ”He's a lot like you really, except people pay him to commit crimes and not solve them.””A consulting criminal”, Sherlock said.AMary shrugged her shoulders.A”In a way.”AShe looked at John again.A”John, I-””Shut up”, he said.AShe shut up and looked down at the table. Amanda's crying was getting louder.A”How do you link to all this?” Sherlock asked.AMary looked up at him.A”I've been part of his organisation since I was 20”, she explained, close to tears at this point. ”I've done all sorts of things for him, and I've never been able to escape. Until John.”AJohn rolled his eyes. He wanted to, but he couldn't believe her, not when every word she had said up until that moment had been a lie.A”Do you know how to contact him?” Sherlock asked.”I haven't been part of it in forever”, Mary cried. ”I swear, I have-””That's not the point”, Sherlock calmly interrupted her. ”The point is, can you get in touch with Moriarty?”AThe tears finally came, they escaped her eyes and started rolling down her cheeks. A”Yes”, she said with a shaking voice. ”I have a phone number.””Call him”, Sherlock commanded. ”Set up a meeting.”AShe stood up slowly.A”I need to do it in the other room”, she said. ”I need to do it alone.”AWith Amanda crying on her shoulder it seemed like a sensible thing to do.A”Go on”, Sherlock told her.AMary handed him her baby without saying a word, and he took it without protesting. He held her like something thin and fragile, made of glass, like he had never held a child in his entire life. It didn't seem unlikely that he never had.AAMary excited the room. John stared at the wall where she had sat and Sherlock looked into Amanda's eyes as if all the secrets of the universe were hidden in her baby blues.A”Oh”, he said.”What?” John asked without looking their way.AThe baby stopped crying. On the other side of the wall they could hear the muffled sound of Mary's voice but not make out any words.A”Nothing”, Sherlock replied.A***AAMary had it scribbled down with a sloppy handwriting on the back of a crumpled receipt. She swapped it for her child and Sherlock looked at it.A”I think I'm done here then”, he said.AHe showed the paper to John. An address and a time.A”It's for tomorrow”, Mary said. ”Does anyone want tea?”AJohn didn't want tea.A”No thank you”, Sherlock said and gave her a thankful smile. ”I'll be leaving now.””I'll see you out”, John said.AHe wanted to go outside and breath fresh air, because he was suffocating inside that house and the walls were closing in on him. They heard Amanda start crying again before they opened the door, but John only closed it behind them when they were outside.”I'll pick you up tomorrow then”, Sherlock said. ”If you're still in, that is.”AAHis voice was softer than it usually was, and he spoke slower, like he was choosing every word. It didn't matter much to John, because he felt numb, dazed and like he was dreaming, all at once.A”Of course I am”, he said. ”I'll be in for the rest of my life.”ASherlock smiled, the biggest and most genuine smile John had ever seen on his face. It was almost a grinny, a silly, childish grin, all happy and soppy. But John couldn't help but to smile back. He didn't feel like smiling, he didn't plan to, it just happened. His mouth had a mind of its own and had decided to smile, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.AAAnd as it turned out, Sherlock's mouth had a mind of its own too. Quickly, before John could even react, Sherlock leaned forwards and tilted his head down. And then his lips were on his.AAIt wasn't a deep kiss, it wasn't long. It was soft and only on the lips and it lasted for two seconds at the most, but it felt like an eternity. A glorious, wonderful eternity.AAAnd there the stars were. They had been hidden in Sherlock's lips all along, and suddenly they were everywhere and nowhere and John didn't know what to do with himself.AASo he kissed him back.A ",Life in colour,21241

No native speaker, not beta'd, not britpicked. I loved the idea of  them coming together like magnets. there is just nothing either of them can do. Force of nature.I do have some ideas how they'll meet again and want to write them down. :-)",2015-08-15, Mature," Sherlock Holmes/John Watson, Sherlock Holmes & John Watson",John - Sherlock...in a park. They see each other and are drawn to each other.,"John Watson was out of shape. He used to run 15 miles on a semi daily basis without much effort, but now he was out of breath and starting to have a stitch. He stopped at a park bench and put his right foot up. Maybe a little bit of stretching would help. Confident that no one was around to see or hear him (he liked to run in the early hours) he swore: ""Buggering fuck, Watson, you sound like an old man. All the panting!"" He started to massage his left calf and looked up at the slightly cloudy sky. He considered sitting down but decided against it. He would never get up again. He put down his right and got his left foot up to repeat the massaging when he caught a movement in the corners of his right eye. He turned his head around. Next to the benches, close in front of the trees were a few scattered rocks. On it lay a boy on his back, his upper body supported by his elbows. Between his fingers of his right hand dangled a lit cigarette. He was watching him, John realized. He turned slightly red and turned his head back, away from that boy.Great. What a great sight he must be: small, panting, swearing guy, incredibly unfit.Whereas the boy on the stones was tall, slim and…John tried to loook without really turning his head…a bit smug. He was clearl scrutinizing John. John got his foot down, jumped a few times up and down and was about to start running again. When he turned he saw that the boy had set up. They both looked at each other. John saw that the boy was likely the same age as him. There was a mob of unkempt hair on his head, some strains had fallen over his eyes what gave him a dashing, kind of adventurous look. And those eyes. Unusually shaped, like almonds and very bright in color and…staring at him! John blushed again.Look away, Watson, he scolded himself.He couldn’t. They were both gazing at each other. What a picture this must be: Two teenagers, one short, sandy-haired in sports gear, one tall, lanky dark-haired in holey black jeans and a white t-shirt, looking each other down, not saying a word. Then the tall boy moved. He flung away his cigarette. Down the rocks he came towards John. Long elegant steps. Like a leopard.One step. Two. Three.John was frozen to the spot. Only one thought crossed his mind: Oh my god. Oh My God! OH MY GOD!!!Then he was standing in front of John, looking into his eyes, a little smile on his face. Only a second later there were hands on John’s shoulders and lips on John’s lips. It was just a mere peck but John was so shocked, he raised a hand to his lips, touching them, trying to find traces of that kiss. The other boys’ smile widened, he tilted his head, searching for John’s eyes as if asking for permission to proceed. John looked up at him and, clearly being possessed by an unknown supernatural force, he cupped the dark-haired boys cheek and caressed it.What was he doing?He’d went out for a run in the park and now HERE he was, about to kiss a complete stranger! Never in his 16 years has he even dreamt of a situation like this. This wasn’t him. He was not one who was easily and fast making out with people. Hell, he only ever kissed twice, really. And one time he was only eleven on a dare and he’d hated it. The other time, with Sarah, a couple of weeks ago was fine. No, it had been great. Why had they not repeated it?“Focus, Watson!,” John thought. And yes, here he was.The follow-up kiss. Christ, that felt amazing. John could taste the cigarette and to his wonder, wasn’t repulsed by it.AWhen had his other hand decided to wind up in that guys hair? God, it felt soft. He was still only at the receiving end of that kiss or rather: of the constant stream of kisses the tall boy gave him. When John started to reciprocate immediately the kissing grew more frantically.They were absolutely, really, unmistakably, heatedly kissing. And fucking hell did it feel good!John sank into those lips that tried to touch each and every corner of his own. Sure, it was clumsy and awkward, but mostly John felt bliss. He was taken aback by the sheer surreality of it all that he forgot everything around him. Around them. He could stay like this forever. Standing in front of a boy he knew nothing about: age, name, origin. Blimey, would they even speak the same language? Other than the language of love? John sniggered at this, laughing about his own ridiculous thought.AThat broke the kiss.AJohn was met by confuses grey-greenish-blue eyes. The owner of those eyes slowly took down the hands from John’s shoulders. John’s hand stayed exactly where they were: wound around the other boys head, runung through hair and along neck.A“It’s just…”, John started. He wanted to make clear that he was laughing about the situation not about the boy or their kissing technique.AThe dark-haired teen just put his index finger on John’s lips before he bent down to give him another very soft kiss. Then he turned and went away with large steps.AA“Wait…!!”, John called. But the boy didn’t so much as turn around.",Power of Attraction,2852

They see each other and are drawn to each other.,"I kissed a boy and I liked it...damn that song buzzed in his head.“Don’t you like it son?” his mother asked. John didn’t listen. He was back in the park. Back kissing the soft lips of a stranger. How ridiculous! How crazy. Had that even happened? The hands on his shoulders, the finger on his lips. Shhhhh...“John?”“Huh?”“I asked if you don’t want to eat?” What were you thinking of, you were miles away?”“Nothing. Not hungry.”He’s been acting like a zombie for four days now, since “the event”. He just couldn’t get his head around what happened. He was struggling with the impulse of going to the park again, looking for that dude who seemed to have no problem to push John’s life into mayhem. He wasn’t paying attention at school, he missed his rugby practice and his coach gave him a good telling-off. He wasn’t eating. He just...drifted through the days. Mind always wandering through a certain park searching for a dark-haired teen with almond-shaped eyes. John realized he had a serious crush and argued with himself: How can I be smitten with someone I do not even know? Whom I haven’t spoken a word with? How can I just be here...like swooning...like a stupid Austen heroine or something? Crikey, what am I turning into? This needs to stop. I won’t see him again anyway. Or will I?His feet acted on their own accord. As did his hands. Combined they got him off the table, mumbling a silly excuse, got him into his running clothes, out of the door and in the direction of Regent’s Park. His heart hammered like crazy the closer he got. He wondered if people could see it nervously beating like you see it in a cartoon. The heart bursting through your shirt and you’d have to push it back into your body.The closer he came to the spot where “it” happened, the slower he got. He was afraid the other one might not be there. Terrified if he was. He got to the bench and the rocks. There was an elderly couple walking by, otherwise the place was empty. Disappointment crept through John’s whole organism. What was he thinking? What would be the odds to meet that guy again? There were over 7 million people living in this city and a gazillion tourists every day. He was about to get home when he heard the rustling of leaves and twigs. Dividing the leaves-curtain of one of the weeping willows was – him! John’s kissing stranger appeared and smiled at him. The smile said “Finally, I’ve been waiting here forever!” Well, that was how John interpreted it.“Uhm. Hi.”, he started.But the boy put a finger over his mouth, telling John to be silent. Then he waved John nearer before he disappeared behind the leaves again, clearly expecting John to follow him. Like a moth into a flame John did.The boy leant against the trunk, his hands behind his head. Apparently he had yet again lit another cigarette. It dangled between his fingers, very close to his left temple. His posture was so clearly an act to appear cool, John almost laughed. But actually he liked that the other one was putting on a bit of a show to...impress him?“Uh, you know that’s careless. The smoking I mean...uh...you shouldn’t do it anyway. Least of all in the woods...I’ve seen pictures of a smoker’s leg in biology class lately, it ain’t pretty”, John stammered.The taller boy just smirked, took his arms down and took a long smoke before he flipped the butt away. He smiled and beckoned him over. This time to come closer. When they stood opposite each other so close they breathed the same air, there was only a very short moment of hesitation before they were kissing again. The taller one flung his arms around John’s middle. John mirrored his action. They stood there, entwined and kissing very softly. “Finally” John sighed into the kiss and it sounded like “fnly”. When he felt the other boy’s tongue seeking way into his mouth, he drew back. Only when he was pulled back and even closer to the other one did John give in and opened his lips to welcome his kissing companion fully. It felt strange but – oh- so wonderful. They kissed and kissed. Heads tilted this way and that way. John felt hands kneading his buttocks. OMG!!!Then the lips on his mouth were gone. As were the hands on his bum. Instead they were now fumbling with his fly. What?The dark-haired was kneeling in front of him, unzipping him and putting his lips against his pants. Feather light kisses on his cock.“Whoa! Wait! What! How? Hnng!”, John gasped. God, everything with this guy happened so fast.The other one’s mouth took the tip of John’s still clothed cock in his mouth. Then the dampened piece of fabric got pulled down and John’s hardening cock sprang free. When he looked down and saw his penis vanish inside the boys’ mouth, he slumped forward and put his hands against the tree for support. Fuck, that was the sexiest, filthiest thing he’d ever seen. With one hand the boy played with his foreskin. Up and down. Up and down. The other one was back on John’s arse. Every time his cock left the boys’ mouth there was the most obscene sound.“This...this is...aah....compl...this...crazy...OH GOD!!””His penis was stroked and sucked and John’s mind went completely blank. His hips bucked forward. Wanting more. More pleasure.“This...I...God...I’m...I’m...oh...oooooh...hngaaah.”That was all the warning John could give. Seconds later he came. The first pulses landed in the taller boys’ mouth before he drew back and turned sideways. Still a bit of come landed on his shoulders before it dropped on the grass. While John came down from his orgasm the other one sat down in front of him and spat out John’s release. John put up his pants and trousers and zipped himself up again. Then he sat down in front of this wild boy.“So sorry. About that.”He pointed vaguely at the signs of his body fluids.His kissing stranger looked at him. His lips deep red and his cheeks flushed. A cum stain on his shoulder. He looked utterly debauched. John felt equally ashamed and proud. They both got up.“Do you want me to...uh...I never...I would, if you like...”The skinny teen just shook his head, lit a cigarette and kissed John’s left ear.“Next time”, he hissed into it. And then he went away.“Wait! When is ‘next time’? Give me your name? Your number!”But with his long strides, the stranger was soon gone.",Power of Attraction,2852

All the French ladies are nicer than our pale hags…It’s the law!”AWhen John didn’t answer Mike looked over to his mate who was scribbling something. “What’s this? You drawing birds or something? I was talking about some other kind of birds, man. The ones with some fine knockers.”AHe bopped John’s side. John wasn’t drawing birds. His drawings were the outlines of some specific boy’s upper lips. That damned Cupid ’s bow.AThe bell rang. Class was over. They packed their stuff and got out. They met their friends outside of school. Greg was smoking and wrapping an arm around Molly who beamed at everyone she saw. She was so in love, it was ridiculous.A“So, are we actually going to that theatre thing or what?”, Greg asked.A“Well we have to”, Molly said.A“Nah, we could skip it. There are soooo many things better we could do, right?”AMolly blushed and giggled a bit. Mike rolled his eyes: “I was actually thinking about breaking my foot or something. Maybe jump in front of a car. Hey, Anderson – you’re an awful enough driver. Fancy knocking me down in a jiffy?”A“You know I’d do anything for you man!” came the reply.A“No honestly, I really don’t wanna go. See some fags in tights running across the stage, ramming their sock stuffed panties in our faces. No thank you.”, Greg complained.A“What’s the point of Music classes anyway?”, Mike asked. “John can you tell me? Since you’re the one with the good grades here.”A“Yeah and I need those to compensate my other numerous failings so I’ll definitely go. “, John said.A“What’s the name of the shit again?” Greg asked.A“Onegin”, Molly said. “Some Russian thing, terribly depressing I bet.”AThey arranged to meet up at 7pm.ABallet did not interest John. So his little protest was not to get dressed up for a night at the ballet. They met with their music teacher in the theatres entrance hall. He gave a short lecture about the play and the dance company: “their awfully good. About your age. See, what you can achieve if you actually put a bit of effort in what you do!” He gave them all a stern look. But his students only yawned or were making mock pirouettes as an answer.AWhen they set down, Greg got himself into sleeping position immediately. He crawled up into the seat and started a false snore. His friends laughed, but his teacher told him off. Soon the curtain rose and…John almost fell of his chair. It was him! His…his…it was his stranger. And oh fucking hell was he ever so graceful. He wore black tights and a black t-shirt. He looked…cool. He played an arrogant aristocrat and John could not take his eyes of him. He was mesmerized. His long legs seemed to fly easily across the stage. He stood on his toes. He bent his body into the most incredible poses. He was magnificent. The way he expressed Onegins feelings made John tremble. He wished his class was gone. He wished everyone gone and just to be here. Alone in the audience with that boy. WAIT! There’s a programme. There was his name? He’d finally have a name. It was too dark to read, but John had to know. Now. He took out his smartphone and put it on. With the light of its phone he could make out the name: “Onegin – Sherlock Holmes”. Sherlock Holmes…Sherlock…A”Watson!!”, hissed his teacher. Put that thing away. Right now!” His mates giggled and Greg gave him the thumbs up.ADuring the break almost everybody was making fun of the dancers and the boring music, but John was silent. He desperately wanted to go back and watch Sherlock.AWhen the ballet was over after 2,5 hours, Greg said: “Well, we survived it. Let’s be proud about that. Grab something to eat, yeah?”AMolly, Mike and Anderson agreed, but John couldn’t leave this place. Not without meeting with Sherlock.A“I think I am exhausted”, John said, “almost 3 hours in the dark watching that stuff and listening to that music (which I absolutely loved every second of)…I’m knackered.”AWhen his mates remained unsuccessful to convince him to join them they left. John left too. He was trying to find a way to the dressing rooms.",Power of Attraction,2852

A travers leurs lettres, cette fois. SEQUEL de I'll Find You Again, deuxième partie de la série It's To You I'll Always Belong.","A A ALa lettre arriva alors que John patrouillait à l'extérieur.ATrois mois s'étaient écoulés depuis qu'il était retourné en Afghanistan. Trois mois depuis Noël. Trois mois depuis qu'il avait entendu parler de Sherlock pour la dernière fois. John avait laissé l'adresse postale de sa base sur le site internet de Sherlock, 'Science de la Déduction,' comme ce dernier l'avait exigé, et avait osé espérer qu'il lui écrirait. Mais à mesure que les jours passaient, la tornade de ces vingt-quatre heures à échanger par portable ressemblait de plus en plus à une scène tiré d'un film romantique – scriptée, et non réelle. Plus John y pensait, plus il était convaincu qu'il était stupide d'y croire. Bien sûr que Sherlock ne lui écrirait pas, pourquoi le ferait-il ? Qui prendrait la peine d'envoyer une lettre à l'autre bout du monde à une entité sans visage ? Sherlock était talentueux, intéressant et probablement riche aussi, alors que John n'était qu'un médecin de l'armée avec un ticket pour la mort collé sur le front. Même si Sherlock ne lui avait pas menti au moment où il lui avait promis de rester en contact avec lui, il avait sûrement changé d'avis par la suite. John ne lui en voulait pas, ne le pouvait pas. Tout cet épisode avait été bien trop étrange et trop beau à la fois pour être vrai.ALe premier mois avait été le plus dur. John se réveillait tous les matins en espérant que la lettre arriverait. Quand il avait été déployé deux ans plus tôt, Harry lui avait écrit quelques fois, puis avait cessé. Il ne recevait plus de lettre. La plupart de ses amis de l'armée en avaient assez régulièrement. Ils avaient une famille, des amis, des partenaires de qui se soucier. C'était une foutue belle vue, quand leurs visages étaient éclairés par le bonheur que leur transmettaient ceux qu'ils aimaient à travers leurs lettres. Alors, quand Sherlock lui avait demandé de laisser son adresse, John n'avait pas seulement été emballé par l'idée de garder contact avec lui. Il avait aussi aimé l'idée de recevoir des lettres. Mais il aurait dû savoir qu'il ne fallait pas espérer.A AAO-O-OAA A''Eh, Watson, t'as du courrier !''AJohn était sur le point d'entrer dans sa tente et s'arrêta net. Il avait reçu une lettre. Instantanément, son esprit se précipita sur Sherlock. Un espoir depuis longtemps abandonné pointa le bout de son nez mais il le rejeta immédiatement. Ca devait être Harry, forcément, et il se sentit nerveux à cette pensée. Sa sœur était imprudente, au bas mot, et avec son alcoolisme, sa vie prenait une spirale descendante de tous les instants. John entra finalement et se tint devant son lit soigneusement fait. Une enveloppe légèrement froissée y reposait. John la fixa pendant un long moment, puis s'en détourna pour enlever son casque et ses vêtements de protection. Du sable mêlé à sa transpiration lui collait au corps, il se sentait sale, fatigué et, par dessus tout, il avait peur.A AAO-O-OAA ACher John,AJe ne te demanderai pas si tu te rappelles de moi parce que je sais que c'est le cas. Ce que je ferai, par contre, sera de te présenter mes excuses pour ne pas avoir écrit plus tôt. Je ne te donnerai aucune justification, parce que seuls les mensonges nécessitent qu'on les détaille. Pour ma défense, je déclarerai seulement que je travaillais au redressement de ma vie. Vois-tu, John, je ne m'engage jamais à moitié dans quoi que ce soit et, si je décidais de tenir ma promesse, alors je savais que je devrais le faire jusqu'au bout. Cela requérait que je sois suffisamment fort pour récupérer des mains de mon frère les responsabilités de ma propre vie. Cela m'a pris trois mois pour y parvenir finalement. Accepteras-tu mes excuses ? Je l'espère.AMaintenant, dis-m'en un peu plus sur toi. Comment vas-tu, physiquement tant que mentalement ? Comment fut ta veillée de Noël ? As-tu retrouvé ton ami, ce Mike ? Quelle est la situation autour de ta base ? Parle-moi de tout et n'importe quoi. Dans un de tes messages, tu disais vouloir mieux me connaître. Est-ce toujours ton souhait ou as-tu changé d'avis ? Parce que je veux en apprendre autant que je le peux à ton propos, John.AJ'ai fini par rentrer à Londres. Mon frère était réticent mais ma grand-mère a insisté pour qu'il me reprenne. J'ai menacé d'empoisonner ses chats, vois-tu ? Je ne l'aurais pas fait cependant. Je ne maltraite pas les animaux, quand ils sont vivants du moins. Elle a pris tellement peur que même Mycroft n'a pu la convaincre de me garder plus longtemps. Elle joue un peu dans le drama, mais le plan a fonctionné, en tout cas. Londres m'a tellement manqué, cette ville me maintient en vie. Tu me manques aussi, John. Je ne savais même pas qu'il était possible que quelqu'un qu'on ne 'connaît' pas vraiment de façon conventionnelle puisse manquer par son absence. Et cela prouve une fois de plus que la norme est un concept surfait.AJ'ai des nouvelles à t'annoncer, bonnes ou mauvaises, ce sera à toi de voir. J'ai commencé à travailler avec le Yard. L'inspecteur de police, qui est le moins stupide du lot, m'a enfin laissé jeter un coup d'œil à quelques affaires classées. La plupart des cas étaient sans intérêt, ce qui pose encore une fois question sur la compétence de notre département de Police. J'aimerais avoir ton avis sur ce sujet quand tu m'écriras. Tu vas m'écrire, n'est-ce pas, John ? J'espère que trois mois ne sont pas trop longs pour tenir une promesse. Ai-je tort de penser ainsi ? Je voudrais que ce ne soit pas le cas mais si jamais ça l'était, je voudrais juste que tu saches que tu fais maintenant partie des rares moments heureux de ma vie.AJ'attends avec impatience de voir ton écriture manuscrite.ACordialement,ASherlock Holmes.A AAO-O-OAA ALes yeux de John le brûlaient alors qu'il lisait la lettre. Il ne pleurerais pas, cependant, non. Il était un putain de soldat, bordel de merde. Il n'avait pas le droit de pleurer. Trois mois d'attente, trois mois à espérer contre toutes probabilités que Sherlock tiendrait sa promesse et le voilà qui tenait sa récompense entre ses doigts. Il n'avait plus à prétendre que ça n'avait pas d'importance, il n'avait plus à essayer d'oublier ces vingt-quatre heures, plus maintenant. Aujourd'hui, un nouvel espoir était né.A AAO-O-OAA AJohn n'avait pas ouvert la lettre jusqu'à être dans son lit, ce soir-là. Il n'était pas sûr qu'il était prêt à la lire après avoir vu le nom de l'expéditeur. Il était alors tellement excité qu'il s'était senti l'esprit cotonneux. Entre le moment où il avait vu la lettre et celui où il l'avait finalement lue, il avait joué à un jeu de devinettes sur ce qu'elle contenait, mais rien n'aurait pu le préparer à ce que Sherlock avait écrit. La lettre était brute et pas franchement ordinaire, c'était le moins qu'on puisse dire, mais John n'attendait rien de commun venant de ce cinglé de génie. Il avait deviné que Sherlock n'avait pas eu l'occasion de beaucoup se sociabiliser dans sa vie. Il n'aurait pas non plus été surpris d'apprendre que cette lettre était la première informelle que Sherlock ait jamais écrite. Et il l'appréciait tellement, il l'aimait tellement, cette lettre. Elle avait une saveur un peu brute – dépouillée de toute mondanité, intense, précise et honnête. Elle était définitivement comme Sherlock, et John l'adorait absolument.ACette nuit-là, John tomba endormi en essayant de composer sa propre lettre. Il avait une missive à laquelle il devait répondre, après tout.A AA ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

A travers leurs lettres, cette fois. SEQUEL de I'll Find You Again, deuxième partie de la série It's To You I'll Always Belong.","  Ca faisait plus de deux semaines que Sherlock avait envoyé sa lettre à John et toujours aucune réponse ne lui était parvenue. Il était conscient qu'envoyer une lettre à l'autre bout du monde serait une activité coûteuse en temps, surtout en zone de guerre, mais Sherlock Holmes n'était pas un homme patient. Et dans ce cas spécifique, son agitation était double car il ne savait même pas si John lui répondrait ou pas. Et si John l'avait oublié et était déjà passé à autre chose ? Passé à autre chose ? Pourquoi cette expression lui venait-elle à l'esprit, exactement ? Ils n'avaient que fait d'échanger des messages, nom de Dieu ! Sherlock se gifla mentalement. Mais il ne parvint toujours pas à raisonner son malaise.Il était dans un taxi. New Scottland Yard l'avait convoqué plus tôt pour un débriefing à propos d'une affaire qu'il avait résolue la nuit précédente. Après avoir travaillé sur une enquête intéressante, une sensation grisante de calme absolu l'envahissait habituellement pendant au moins une journée. Mais plus l'intervalle croissait entre l'envoi de sa lettre à John et le moment présent, plus Sherlock s'agitait. Il se haïssait pour ça, mais il ne pouvait oublier le sentiment qu'il avait expérimenté quand John avait voulu créer une connexion avec lui. Cette envie d'être nécessaire à un autre être humain, pas pour une affaire, pas pour une quelconque raison égoïste mais juste pour lui-même, lui était tellement étrangère qu'il voulait l'expérimenter encore une fois. Cependant, après dix-sept jours, Sherlock commençait à penser que ces vingt-quatre heures n'avaient été qu'un feu de paille.Il arrivait chez lui. Enfin, chez Mycroft plutôt. Il détestait être en permanence sous le nez de son frère mais même Sherlock savait qu'il serait vain voire stupide de demander à Mycroft s'il pouvait vivre seul. Il ne le permettrait pas. Pas après l'avoir découvert dans un repère de camés seulement une semaine après avoir décidé de le laisser vivre dans son propre appartement, la première fois.Nestor lui ouvrit la porte. C'était le majordome de Mycroft (l'enfoiré avait un foutu majordome!) et son vrai nom était quelque chose comme Roger ou Robert ou quelque chose en 'R' mais il ressemblait à un Nestor, alors Sherlock l'appelait ainsi. Quoi qu'il en soit, après lui avoir ouvert, Nestor l'informa qu'une lettre avait été déposée pour lui dans la journée et qu'elle était actuellement dans sa chambre. Sherlock le harcelait tous les jours à propos d'une lettre, le majordome avait donc pensé avisé de le prévenir immédiatement plutôt que d'attendre qu'il l'agace une nouvelle fois. Sherlock courut presque jusqu'à sa chambre. AO-O-OA Cher Sherlock,Je dois avoir regardé cette feuille pendant dix bonnes minutes, au moins. Je ne sais ni comment ni par où commencer. Le fait que tu aies laissé de côté les politesses d'usage me donne encore moins d'options. Pas que je veuille que tu sois formel avec moi ou quoi que ce soit. En fait, je suis content que tu n'aies pas donné dans la politesse, comme ça je n'ai pas à être formel non plus. Oh là, je jacasse là ! Génial... Mais je suis tellement fébrile, merde ! Pas parce que je ne m'attendais plus à ce que tu m'écrives, mais justement parce que j'ai attendu cette lettre pendant ces trois derniers mois.J'imagine que je devrais te remercier de m'écrire et prétendre que ça n'a pas la moindre importance pour moi que ça ait mis trois putains de mois à arriver, mais je ne peux pas, Sherlock. Je ne suis pas du genre déballe-tout-ce-qu'il-a-sur-le-coeur, mais j'ai décidé de ne rien te cacher. Parfois dans la vie, on rencontre des personnes qui nous donnent envie de relâcher le contrôle de soi, avec qui on veut être soi-même, sans prétention, ni masque. Tu es 'cette' personne pour moi, avec qui je veux n'être que John. Pas un soldat, pas un docteur responsable, pas le compréhensif et compliant John Watson, juste John. Alors, je dois t'avouer que j'ai été littéralement misérable ces derniers mois. Tu ne peux pas rendre la vue à un aveugle dans le seul objectif de la lui reprendre ensuite, car c'est rendre son obscurité encore plus vide qu'elle ne l'était déjà. Je sais que tu avais des obligations, des contraintes mais je te dis seulement ce que j'ai ressenti, c'est tout. Et ça ne signifie pas que je t'en veux ni rien. Tu ne peux pas imaginer combien je suis heureux d'avoir ta lettre entre les mains. Tu n'avais même pas besoin de t'excuser, Sherlock, pas quand cette lettre me rend incroyablement heureux. Et, eh ! Pas de désolé ni de merci entre amis, ok ? Bon, fin de la partie angoisse de ma lettre.Qu'est-ce que tu as fait, génie furieux, qui a obligé ton frère à exercer tant de contrôle sur ta vie ? Tu n'as jamais été serial killer, hein ? Ou un fabriquant d'armes nucléaires ? Je ne serais même pas surpris que ce soit le cas. Oui oui, je sais, une autre tentative stupide d'être 'drôle'. Enfin, tu as dit que ta Mamie 'donnait un peu dans le drama', maintenant je sais de qui tu tiens. La menacer d'empoisonner ses chats ?! Je sais que je ne suis pas censé dire ça, mais en fait c'était une idée ingénieuse. J'en ai presque pleuré de rire.Comment vas-tu ? Comment va Londres ? Oh, comme il me manque, ce chez moi. Est-ce toujours vraiment chez moi ? Je ne sais pas. Comment s'est passé ton voyage en France ? Tu as eu l'occasion de rouler une pelle bien française à quelqu'un sous la Tour Eiffel ? J'ai entendu dire que c'était magnifique, de nuit. Tout va bien, ici, du moins aussi bien que peut aller une base militaire. Il y a eu un peu d'agitations mineures le mois dernier, mais c'est calme, maintenant, en comparaison. Ca fait cinq jours qu'un soldat blessé n'est plus passé par la tente médical. C'est plutôt tranquille pour l'instant, peut-être le genre de calme avant la tempête. Mais ne t'inquiète pas : nous sommes toujours sur nos gardes. Noël s'est passé correctement. J'ai rencontré Mike dans un pub et on a discuté quelques heures. C'était sympa de le voir. C'est un de mes plus vieux amis. C'était une soirée agréable. Mais tu m'as manqué tout le long. Ca me manque, nos messages.Alors tu es Détective Consultant maintenant, hein ? Et le seul au monde, puisque tu as inventé le métier ! Wow, putain, c'est génial, Sherlock ! Le monde va enfin savoir à quel point tu es brillant. C'est incroyable ! Je me sens tellement fier ! Est-ce que tu as fait des déductions sur quelqu'un du Yard ? Est-ce que tu bosses sur une affaire en ce moment ? Si ça te pose pas de problème, j'aimerais bien en savoir un peu plus. Je suis content que tu fasses ce que tu voulais faire depuis si longtemps.Il fait nuit ici et je devrais dormir, puisque je ne suis pas de patrouille ce soir, mais j'ai plutôt envie de continuer à t'écrire encore et encore. La longueur de ma lettre te le prouve. Je suis naze pour écrire des lettres, je n'en ai pas vraiment la pratique et je me rate à chaque fois que j'essaie d'exprimer mes émotions. Je suis désolé si tu meurs d'ennui en lisant celle-ci. Je suis sûr que les prochaines seront mieux.Merci Sherlock d'avoir tenu ta promesse et de m'avoir donné quelque chose en quoi espérer. Ecris-moi vite, d'accord ? Prends soin de toi et sois brillant.Avec tous mes bons vœux pour ta nouvelle carrière,John Watson. AO-O-OA Sherlock n'avait jamais reçu de lettre informelle de la part de quelqu'un d'autre qu'un membre de sa famille. Il ne savait donc pas du tout à quoi s'attendre mais s'il y avait une chose de laquelle il était sûr, c'était que celle de John le laissait surpris, choqué, et incroyablement heureux. Il savait que John était un type ouvert mais il ne s'était jamais attendu à autant de franchise de la part de qui que ce soit et ça le laissait bouleversé. John avait attendu sa lettre chaque jour ? John s'était senti misérable de ne pas la voir venir ? Sherlock lui manquait ? John avait choisi Sherlock pour être 'cette' personne, avec qui il pourrait être... juste lui-même ? Il le voyait comme son... son ami !? Sherlock était la cause de la bonne humeur d'un autre être humain ? Quelqu'un qui était heureux grâce à lui ? Grâce à Sherlock, le type bizarre et effrayant ? Et, surtout, John était fier de lui... L'esprit hypersensible de Sherlock se vida rapidement alors qu'il se réfugiait dans le seul endroit réconfortant qu'il connaissait – son Palais Mental. Il se sentait dispersé aux quatre vents et avait besoin de se rassembler. Et il avait intérêt à y parvenir rapidement, parce que John Watson attendait.  ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

A travers leurs lettres, cette fois. SEQUEL de I'll Find You Again, deuxième partie de la série It's To You I'll Always Belong.","A A ALa semaine suivante fut agitée pour John. La base 3, voisine de la leur, avait essuyé une attaque ; il y avait eu des explosions, du sang, des blessés et des morts – scène habituelle sur un champ de bataille actif. Un des deux médecins de la base 3 avait lui aussi été blessé et John avait dû, accompagné d'une équipe de soutien de sa propre base, la 4, se rendre sur le site de l'explosion. Il était maintenant un soldat aguerri, mais être témoin de la vie s'échappant d'un corps l'affectait chaque fois comme si c'était la première. Il avait sauvé la plupart de ses camarades d'armes blessés dans l'explosion, et il pleurerait à sa façon ceux pour lesquels il n'avait rien pu faire. Alors quand la lettre de Sherlock arriva au milieu de cette pagaille, il choisit de prendre son temps avant d'écrire sa propre réponse. Il doutait de sa capacité à offrir une réponse adaptée à une lettre d'une intensité si peu commune.AEt en attendant, quand alterner entre ses rôles de docteur et de soldat l'épuisait trop et qu'il se sentait totalement vidé, John relisait encore et encore la lettre de Sherlock, pour se souvenir de cet espoir que son auteur représentait.A AAO-O-OAA ACher John,AJe dois admettre que j'ai été quelque peu surpris par ta lettre. J'abhorre reconnaître que je n'ai pas vraiment beaucoup d'expérience pour ce qui est de la lecture de correspondances personnelles ou amicales, mais je peux déterminer que cette sorte de franchise peu habituelle est rare entre deux personnes qui ne se 'connaissent' même pas de façon conventionnelle. Ceci étant dit, je me dois de clarifier ma réaction, dans l'intérêt de ton cerveau plutôt stupide qui, bien entendu, est déjà en train de formuler toute sorte de conclusions erronées : 'peu habituelle' a ici un sens positif. J'ai énormément apprécié ta lettre.AIl n'est pas dans ma nature de présenter des excuses de façon général, et les présenter deux fois pour la même cause ne m'est certainement jamais arrivé de toute ma vie, mais me voici, te demandant de me pardonner une fois encore d'avoir mis tant de temps à t'envoyer ma première lettre et de t'avoir causé tant d'agitation de par ce délai. D'autre part, je suis heureux que tu aies choisi d'exprimer tes ressentis à ce sujet. Cela m'a offert un aperçu de ta pensée, ce que j'ai grandement apprécié. Mais John, ton sens de la métaphore est affligeant. Un homme aveugle, vraiment ? Ne cesse pas d'essayer d'être poétique, cependant, c'est assez amusant. Et je ne compte pas arrêter cette correspondance ; je ne commence jamais quelque chose que je ne suis pas en mesure d'achever.AJe ne vais pas pouvoir t'expliquer de façon détaillée les raisons pour lesquelles j'ai été forcé de céder à mon frère la direction de ma propre vie, disons seulement que prendre de bonnes décisions sur un coup de tête n'est pas mon fort. J'ai mes démons et pour le dire encore plus simplement (pour le bien de ton esprit plutôt simplet) l'expression ''tout ce qui ne me tue pas me rend plus vivant'' est très appropriée, dans ma situation. Et non, John, jamais tuer en série ni fabriquer des armes nucléaires n'ont été/ne sont/ne seront mes choix de carrière.APourquoi donc voudrais-je contaminer ma bouche avec la salive d'une autre personne ? Je suis vraiment choqué que tu aies pu imaginer que je puisse perdre mon temps à quelque chose d'aussi naïf ! Et en quoi s'embrasser sous la Tour Eiffel pourrait être intéressant ? Est-ce que cette activité permet de mieux apprécier l'architecture complexe de cet édifice ? Ceci dit, jeter quelqu'un du sommet de la Tour et observer le schéma d'écrasement de ses os pourrait être assez édifiant. Il faut que je songe sérieusement à cette expérience. Et oui, John, voir la Tour Eiffel de nuit est une chose à faire. J'espère que nous en aurons l'occasion un jour. J'ai essentiellement passé mes journées en France à comploter pour m'évader de la maison de ma grand-mère, tu peux donc imaginer comme c'était un séjour plaisant.AJe suis content de savoir que tu trouves ma nouvelle carrière intéressante. Je te remercie également pour les compliments que tu m'as adressés. Je n'en reçois pas souvent. En fait, ma mère était la dernière et seule personne à m'avoir dit qu'elle était 'fière' de moi. Je sais qu'il n'est pas vraiment possible pour toi d'être réellement fier de moi sans me connaître mais tes mots m'ont néanmoins touché.AEs-tu sûr de vouloir entendre parler de mes affaires ? Tu fais la guerre, tu vois sang et morts plus souvent qu'une personne normale ne le devrait. Veux-tu vraiment entendre des détails sanglants d'assassinats et de revanches ? Si tu es toujours intéressé, je serai plus que disposé à partager mes observations sur ces affaires. Vois-tu, un cerveau vierge et encore peu utilisé est toujours apte à émettre des idées que le spécialiste peut manier par la suite.AEst-ce que tu es souvent en patrouille de nuit ? Les médecins doivent-il aussi patrouiller ? Quelle est la situation, chez toi ? Nous n'avons pas souvent des nouvelles de la guerre, sauf événement majeur. Ta dernière lettre était longue, peu conventionnelle et horriblement sentimentale mais elle était loin d'être ennuyeuse. Et j'espère que celle-ci t'apportera la preuve de la continuité de mon existence : je ne suis pas mort d'ennui en te lisant.AJohn, j'apprécie ton honnêteté et ta franchise. Tu mérites tout autant d'honnêteté en retour et je ferai de mon mieux pour te les rendre, mais sache que ce ne sera pas facile pour moi. Tout ma vie, on m'a appris la réserve et la maîtrise de soi ; comme je suis souvent contraint de le rappeler, je suis un sociopathe (je préfère l'appellation Sociopathe Hautement Fonctionnel), alors j'espère que tu m'excuseras si je ne parviens pas à t'exprimer autant de franchise que tu as su le faire. Mais ne doute jamais, John, que je suis honoré que tu m'aies choisi pour être 'cette personne'. Je ne suis pas quelqu'un qui a des amis, mais maintenant je pense en avoir un.ALe jour où tu m'as envoyé un message pour la première fois, j'ai enregistré ton numéro sous le nom Strange John. Je n'avais pas tort. Tu es Etrange, d'une façon très positive. Tes messages stupides me manquent aussi. Essaie de m'écrire plus vite.ACordialement,ASherlock Holmes.A AAO-O-OAA AQuand John la lut pour la première fois, son cerveau n'enregistra pas tout que cette lettre transmettait à la fois. Il venait alors de rentrer à sa propre base. La portée des mots ne se révéla pleinement à lui qu'à la seconde lecture, après laquelle il se demanda comment une simple lettre pouvait faire naître autant d'émotions contradictoires en lui. C'était tout à la fois adorable, étrange, hilarant, amer et incroyable avec une nuance de tristesse. Il découvrait à travers ces mots une facette de Sherlock entièrement nouvelle qui le laissa abasourdi. Il était sidéré de voir comme Sherlock parlait si facilement d'eux en utilisant 'nous'. Il n'avait pas la moindre idée de comment il était censé réagir à ça ; il n'avait même pas la certitude que Sherlock était conscient de la portée de ce 'nous'. Ca avait été dur pour John de véritablement ouvrir son cœur et son esprit avec autant de franchise mais il décida qu'il continuerait malgré tout à le faire, car il voulait montrer à ce génie solitaire combien il était important pour lui, combien chacun de ses mots lui était précieux. Il décida d'offrir à Sherlock toutes les miettes de joie qu'il pouvait lui transmettre en étant à des milliers de kilomètres de lui. Parce que Sherlock méritait d'être heureux.A AA ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

Non, ne néglige pas cette question comme si ce n'était qu'une formalité. Réponds-moi honnêtement parce que j'ai besoin de le savoir. J'ai besoin de savoir que tu vas bien. J'ai aussi envoyé une lettre à Harry mais je ne vais certainement pas avoir de réponse d'elle. Dis-moi juste comment toi tu vas, ok ?AJ'avais raison, tu sais. C'était en effet le calme avant la tempête. Il y a eu des explosions dans la base militaire voisine et on a dû envoyer une équipe de renfort. J'en étais. Mort, sang, membres mutilés – c'était l'enfer Sherlock, l'enfer. Peu importe combien de fois je les vois mourir, c'est toujours comme si c'était la première. Je veux dire...Comment on s'habitue à la mort ? Moi, je ne peux pas. Il y avait ce jeune, Reggie, j'ai essayé de le sauver, tu sais. J'ai vraiment essayé mais je n'ai pas réussi. Il avait le nom de sa toute petite sœur tatoué sur le bras. Il n'avait que 22 ans. Notre âge. Il me faisait penser à toi. Je l'ai abandonné. J'ai fait de mon mieux mais non. Je tenais sa vie entre mes doigts et je l'ai laissé échapper. Et tu sais ce que j'ai fait après ? Je me suis noyé dans l'alcool. Et j'ai pensé à toi. Est-ce que tu as des tatouages, Sherlock ?ATu dis que je suis un idiot mais c'est toi qui es stupide et irréfléchi, en vrai. Comment peux-tu, avec ton niveau d'intelligence, t'abîmer ainsi ? Tu as un cerveau hors du commun et tu ne peux pas contrôler de simples addictions ? Je remercie ton frère pour son intervention. Ta vie n'appartiens pas qu'à toi, Sherlock. Tu es trop brillant et trop précieux pour te laisser t'échouer dans un abîme. Ne le fais plus, s'il te plaît. Qui va me rappeler vers la maison, si tu n'y es plus ?ATu dis qu'on verra la Tour Eiffel de nuit un jour. Tu le penses vraiment ? Quand on a la tête sous l'eau, on planifie notre futur : quand est-ce qu'on va enfin rentrer, combien d'enfants on aura ou à quel point nos partenaires seront magnifiques, les palissades de nos maisons, le jardin – des choses futiles comme ça, rien de fantaisiste. C'est notre façon de voler des moments d'insouciance, on se laisse bercer par ces paroles sans importance parce qu'on sait que demain il n'y aura que le sable et le Soleil brûlant pour nous accueillir. Je parie que Reggie avait des rêves comme ça, lui aussi. J'aimerais bien visiter Paris avec toi. Et on s'éclatera, hein ?ALes nuits sont froides ici. Pas froides-comme-à-Londres, mais froides-comme-du-vide. Elles me laissent sec et creux. Pas toujours quand même. Je suis une loque, là, et tout me paraît morbide. Ce n'est pas que les médecins doivent toujours patrouiller, mais des fois il faut. Des fois je suis volontaire. Plonger dans l'inconnu, le danger qui rampe autour de moi. J'aime cette montée d'adrénaline.AIl n'y a rien de nouveau dans ma vie, à part la lutte quotidienne pour survivre. Les périodes comme celle-ci ébranlent notre détermination, des fois. On s'est mis à recevoir des lettres de résidents d'un centre de désintoxication. J'ai reçue celle d'un gars, un gamin plutôt. Seulement 17 ans. Le gosse est un toxico en sevrage. J'espère qu'il tiendra. Il a toute la vie devant lui. Se droguer pour surmonter la douleur, ce n'est pas seulement stupide mais lâche. Je veux dire, combien de temps espère-t-il échapper à la réalité ? Il faut y faire face et l'affronter. Je ne lui ai pas dit ça mais s'il continue à m'écrire, je le ferai. Je déteste faire des sermons mais ces personnes ont plus besoin d'amis que de médocs. Ils ont besoin d'une fenêtre pour pouvoir respirer. Mais il ne va pas m'écrire très longtemps, c'est sûr. Qui voudrait écrire à un soldat insipide ? Je sais que tu vas finir par te lasser de moi, toi aussi. Il n'y a rien d'intéressant chez moi, de captivant dans ma vie et je sais que tu détestes t'ennuyer. Tu vas vite te lasser et je finirai par relire tes vieilles lettres tous les jours. Mais d'ici là, on peut quand même prévoir nos vacances à Paris, hein ? Pas mal comme futur pour un homme avec un billet pour la mort, hein ?''ACeux qui ne veulent pas se lier avec toi, qu'ils aillent se faire foutre (pas par toi). Je suis sûr qu'ils ne méritent pas de t'avoir toi, Sherlock Holmes, comme ami. Et tu as un charmant et pimpant John Watson à ton service donc ne te préoccupe pas des autres. Je suis sûr que tu as toujours rencontré les mauvaises personnes toute au long de ta vie. Mais tu es à présent sauf grâce à ton humble Doc de l'armée. Blagues à part, tu es le génie le plus brillant que j'aie rencontré de ma vie, Sherlock ! Ouais, t'es peut-être pas la tasse de thé de tout le monde mais c'est une perte pour EUX de ne pas apprendre à te connaître.AUn de mes potes est devenu papa récemment. C'est un petit garçon, un petit truc dans une couche avec une tête toute rouge et ridée. Sa famille a envoyé des photos. On a célébré ça, un peu. C'est toujours incroyable de voir une nouvelle vie. Je n'ai pas grand chose de neuf dans ma vie, du coup j'ai pensé que je pouvais partager ça avec toi.ABien sûr que je suis toujours intéressé par tes affaires. S'il te plaît, écris à propos de ça. C'est bien d'attraper des ennemis connus plutôt que de tenir un fusil face à des entités sans visages. Et parler de tes affaires maintiendra ton intérêt à m'écrire, avec un peu d'espoir. Sinon je suis coincé avec un morveux qui m'explique que le programme de désintox est merdique ou combien je suis encore plus un raté que ce que je pourrais penser. Dieu sait combien j'attends ta lettre avec impatience. Prends soin de toi Sherlock, et s'il te plaît, ne sois pas imprudent avec ta vie. Ecris-moi vite, d'accord ?AAmicalement,AStrange JohnAAO-O-OAAAprès avoir lu la lettre entière, Sherlock ressentit deux choses – une faible panique en pensant à la déprime de John (mais il était sûr que ce n'était que de l'inquiétude et absolument rien d'autre), et une irrationnelle poussée de jalousie de savoir que John écrivait aussi à quelqu'un d'autre (bien sûr, Sherlock ne l'admettrait pas plus). Il voulait trouver le gamin et le virer de son centre à coups de pied, mais il se raisonna en se disant qu'il était juste énervé que ce glandu ait insulté John de raté. Sherlock réfléchissait à comment rendre ses lettres plus intéressantes pour John de façon à ce qu'il ait encore moins envie d'écrire à ce con. Il voulait faire comprendre à John combien lui aussi appréciait ses lettres, combien il comptait pour lui. John ne pourrait jamais décevoir ni abandonner qui que ce soit. Il y avait aussi ce petit flottement bizarre qu'il avait ressenti quand il avait lu que John voulait planifier quelque chose avec lui, mais il décida de ne pas s'appesantir là-dessus pour le moment.ASherlock se fit aussi une note mentale pour se souvenir de dire à John de ne jamais remercier Mycroft – jamais.A AA ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

C'est un corps carbonisé !''''Hem...''''Ce type est mort ?''''Hem...''''Doc, pourquoi tu reçois ces... euh... ces... m... ?''''Hem...''''Qui te les envoie, Watson ?''''Hem...'' AO-O-OA Cher John,Mon existence se poursuit sans interruption fatale. Je vais aussi bien qu'il est possible d'aller au milieu de ces idiots incompétents qui cernent ma vie (il existe, bien entendu, quelques exceptions).Je suis désolé d'apprendre la mort regrettable de ce jeune soldat que tu as mentionné dans ta dernière lettre. Je déteste la politique de la guerre : je ne comprends pas la motivation qui pousse des personnes à s'enrôler pour combattre dans une guerre qui est panifiée dans des pièces froides par des dirigeants politiques tout aussi froids et égoïstes qui ne le font que pour leur bénéfice personnel. Je ne dénigre pas le courage dont font preuve les soldat, je n'ai ni la légitimité ni la volonté de le faire, mais je doute franchement que la Cause justifie leur mort. Quoi qu'il en soit, je suis extrêmement soulagé de savoir que tu es relativement sauf. Tu apporteras bien plus à la société vivant que tué en contrée étrangère.Je ne peux pas changer ce passé où j'ai pris des décisions impulsives et néfastes pour ma vie, mais je peux t'assurer, John, que je me suis ressaisi. Voir la façon dont tu gères ton existence et les choix que tu fais me fait prendre conscience de mes folies passées et essayer de les rectifier. Mais s'il te plaît, ne remercie jamais mon frère pour quoi que ce soit. Ce n'est qu'un homme aspirant au maximum de pouvoir, arrogant et intrusif, rien d'autre.J'ai résolu une affaire juste hier. C'était insipide et ennuyeux. Je ne sais même pas pourquoi Lestrade m'a appelé pour celle-là. C'est une véritable insulte à mon intellect. Cette vieille femme de Croydon a reçu un colis envoyé de Belfast par un inconnu. Une boîte en carton enveloppée dans du papier brun et de la ficelle, avec deux oreilles coupées à l'intérieur. Il était clair de par leur structure que l'une appartenait à une femme et l'autre à un homme. La destinataire a d'abord cru à une blague cruelle d'un des étudiants en médecine qui la logeaient quand elle habitait à Belfast. Mais ce n'était bien sûr pas le cas et les oreilles avaient été prélevées sur des corps frais avec un objet émoussé et ne contenaient aucune trace des conservateurs chimiques habituellement utilisés en médecine et dans les morgues. Sa théorie d'un ex-logeur meurtrier a ainsi été écarté par mes déductions. La police s'agitait à propos des oreilles mais c'étaient la boîte et son emballage qui m'intéressaient. La boîte était commune et du genre de celles qu'on utilise souvent dans les entreprises de pêche. La ficelle était du même acabit et la façon dont notre expéditeur mystère avait fait les nœuds m'a mené à la conclusion que cette personne travaillait sur un bateau de commerce. Cela établi, j'ai été interroger la femme qui a reçu ce paquet et j'ai découvert trois faits – Mme Susan Cushing a deux autres sœurs dont une qui partageait les mêmes initiales qu'elle (seul S. Cushing était mentionnée sur l'adresse de réception), le mari de sa plus jeune sœur travaillait sur un navire marchand, et enfin, l'oreille de Madame Cushing montrait des ressemblances frappantes avec celle qui avait été prélevée sur une femme. L'affaire était alors immédiatement claire, mais je manquais toujours d'information sur le motif. J'ai été interroger l'autre sœur Cushing qui partageait ses initiales avec Susan puisqu'il devenait évident que ce colis était destiné à cette Sarah qui avait partagé un appartement avec sa sœur aînée quelques mois plus tôt. Lorsque j'arrivai chez elle, j'appris qu'elle ne pourrait pas me recevoir en raison d'une soudaine maladie. J'avais en main toutes les informations nécessaires. J'informai alors Lestrade qu'il devait prévenir le département de police de Belfast de rechercher un certain M. Browning, le mari de la plus jeune des sœurs, Mary. Il fut rapidement arrêté et confessa son crime – sa femme avait une liaison avec un autre homme et cette Sarah Cushing l'en avait informé (parce qu'elle était amoureuse de ce Browning et qu'elle n'a jamais approuvé le mariage de sa sœur avec lui). Il a tué Mary et son amant, ivre de rage, un soir, et a coupé leurs oreilles pour les envoyer à Sarah, qu'il haïssait tout autant pour avoir aidé sa sœur à maintenir cette liaison pour mettre fin à son mariage.C'était ennuyeux et totalement stéréotypique du cas de liaison extraconjugale menant à un meurtre. Arrives-tu à croire qu'il n'y a pas un cerveau suffisamment brillant au Yard pour résoudre ce crime ? Je te le relate uniquement parce que tu as dit que tu voulais connaître les affaires sur lesquelles je travaille. Maintenant tu sais combien les criminels d'aujourd'hui sont insipides ! Oh, John, pourquoi n'existe-t-il pas un criminel assez malin pour représenter un véritable défi intellectuel ? Je m'ennuie, et c'est la faute de Mycroft.Je pense que je dois te féliciter pour ton succès à trouver un imbécile suffisamment bête pour dire de quelqu'un à qui il n'a encore jamais parlé qu'il est un raté. Je m'ébahis devant son niveau intellectuel qui l'a amené à tirer cette conclusion à ton propos alors qu'il ne possédait aucune donnée. J'imagine que vous êtes tous les deux liés par votre idiotie mutuelle. Mais méfie-toi, John, ou il pourrait bien te battre sur le plan de la stupidité. Et ne sois pas pénible, John, je n'ai peut-être pas le génie de ta nouvelle connaissance, mais tu ne parviendras pas à te débarrasser de moi si facilement. Je continuerai à t'honorer de mes lettres aussi longtemps que ton adresse postale sera valable.John, je sais que les gens ont tendance à porter le deuil de leurs morts mais ne penses-tu pas que tu ferais mieux de compter les vies que tu as sauvées plutôt que de garder le compte de celles que tu as perdues sur ta table ? Je pense que ça vaudrait le coup d'essayer, si tu veux mon avis.La haine de soi est pour les faibles, John, et tu n'en es pas un. Essaie de prendre soin de toi. Ta vie n'appartient pas qu'à toi non plus. Je détesterais que notre visite de Paris tombe à l'eau à cause de ton incapacité à rester vivant. Réponds vite.Bien à toi,Sherlock.PS : il semblerait que tu aimes les photos, raison pour laquelle je t'envoie des images de mes affaires (la dernière comprise). J'espère que tu les apprécieras. AO-O-OA John n'avait à aucun moment voulu montrer les photos à ses compagnons d'armes. Mais ceux-ci les lui avaient fauchées et John ne voulait pas se souvenir de ce qui s'était passé ensuite. Ca avait été le pur chaos, dans le bon sens du terme. Les collègues de John l'adoraient tout autant que lui-même les adorait, et ils avaient leur propre comptant de trucs bizarres, mais l'idée d'envoyer à quelqu'un des photos de gens morts allait un peu trop loin, même pour eux. Certains des plus jeunes étaient complètement mortifiés et d'autres taquinèrent John jusqu'aux larmes. John en vint à leur expliquer Sherlock, mais ça ne lui attira que plus de piques moqueuses, clins d'œil et sifflets. Seul Murr ne s'y joignit pas, et John savait qu'il devrait affronter une discussion avec lui plus tôt qu'il ne le voudrait. Mais, pour l'instant, il repoussait toutes ces pensées pour lire la lettre de Sherlock une nouvelle fois.Un millier de questions lui traversaient l'esprit, à présent. Cette lettre était légèrement différente des autres. Bien sûr, il y avait l'affaire qui y était intéressante, mais dans cette lettre, Sherlock paraissait plus ouvert, plus... quelque chose. Et peut-être un peu jaloux ? John laissa son doigt courir sur les mots ''bien à toi, Sherlock'' et sentit une vague de désir pressant d'être aux côtés de l'auteur. Il ferma les yeux et essaya d'imaginer toutes les émotions qui avaient mené Sherlock à écrire toutes ces petites choses qui rendaient John irrationnellement heureux. Ces photos n'étaient peut-être pas appropriées mais la raison pour laquelle Sherlock les lui avait envoyées était suffisante pour rendre John fébrile. Il ne se souvenait pas de la dernière fois où quelqu'un faisait un effort conscient pour le faire sourire. La tendresse qu'il ressentait alors envers cet homme cinglé intensifia le désir ardent de voir Sherlock et il décida d'enfin lui demander quelque chose qu'il souhaitait depuis sa première lettre. ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

C'est un compliment, tu sais. On dirait que les petits cons sont mon genre aussi, surtout quand ils sont snobs en plus.Je ne vais pas te dire que je comprends et que je suis d'accord avec toutes les notions que tu as de la guerre mais ça me fait plaisir de savoir que tu ne nous vois pas juste comme une bande d'allumés avec un complexe du martyre (tu te souviens de ce SMS?). Personnellement, ma motivation pour rejoindre l'armée était égoïste. Je voulais être médecin depuis mon enfance et je savais que je ne pourrais pas payer les dépenses nécessaires pour ces études. Je me suis donc enrôlé pour obtenir mon diplôme. Mais ce n'est pas la seule raison. Je savais aussi que je ne suis pas fait pour une vie calme comme je pourrais en avoir une à l'hôpital ou en clinique. Je voulais utiliser mes compétences au maximum, et quoi de mieux qu'un champ de bataille pour ça ?Je ne connais pas ton passé Sherlock, mais ça n'a pas d'importance. Enfin, ça en a clairement d'une façon globale, mais je ne juge pas les gens sur leur passé. C'est la façon dont ils construisent leur présent qui compte le plus. Moi aussi je voudrais effacer des choses de mon passé, effacer chacune de mes erreurs. J'imagine qu'on est nombreux à le vouloir mais ces erreurs nous apprennent aussi ce qu'on souhaite réellement, non ? Quelqu'un qui ne fait jamais que les bons choix ne vit PAS sa vie de la bonne manière, voire ne la vit pas du tout. Faire des erreurs fait partie de la vie, c'est un processus naturel qui permet de gagner de l'expérience. Cependant, répéter les mêmes erreurs est absolument stupide. Sache donc que si jamais tu essayais de commettre de nouveau toutes ces choses qui t'ont déjà mis en danger dans le passé, je te promets que je te tirerai par la peau du cul jusqu'ici et cognerai sur le cerveau hypertrophié qui te sert à réfléchir. Tu n'as encore jamais testé la puissance de la colère divine d'un Watson.Tu te souviens du gamin en désintox dont je t'ai parlé ? Il s'avère qu'il n'est pas si inintéressant que ça, finalement. Dans sa deuxième lettre, il m'appelle 'type relativement correct.'' Ha ! Il me fait penser à toi. On dirait que je suis un aimant à sales mômes.Cette affaire n'était pas si mal, Sherlock. Je veux dire, tuer sa femme et son amant puis envoyer leurs oreilles coupées dans une boîte, c'est perturbant, même pour quelqu'un comme moi ! Et ce n'est pas la faute des criminels si leurs compétences ne parviennent pas à te satisfaire ! Tu es Sherlock Holmes, après tout, le seul au monde. Et je t'en supplie, ne décide pas de devenir prof pour apprendre aux graines de criminels à être créatifs. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai bien aimé cette histoire (même si ta façon de raconter est nulle) et j'attends d'en entendre d'autres. Je suis ravi que tu puisses faire ce que tu fais le mieux, Sherlock, et peu importe combien tu te plains, je sais que tu es content. Et je me sens content aussi, du coup.Les photos que tu m'as envoyées sont intéressantes, très intrigantes, oui. C'est quoi l'histoire qui va avec le corps calciné ? Un de mes potes a vraiment flippé ; c'est un jeune, il n'a encore jamais vu la guerre pour de vrai. Mais tu sais ce que j'ai le plus aimé ? Tes efforts pour me donner le sourire. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de monde dans ma vie qui essaie de faire ça. J'apprécie tellement, Sherlock. Plus que tu ne peux l'imaginer. Et enlève cet air renfrogné de ton visage.Je me demandais si on pouvait peut-être s'envoyer d'autres photos, aussi ? Tu sais, un peu plus personnelles ? Comme ta maison ou ton frère, ou toi ? Oh, puis merde : le truc, c'est que j'ai vraiment envie de savoir à quoi tu ressembles. Je voulais te voir dès le premier jour où on s'est parlé par SMS. Et si quelque chose devait m'arriver, je mourrai fièrement en sachant que je suis plus séduisant que toi. Alors, qu'en dis-tu, Sherlock ? Est-ce que j'aurai un aperçu du seul Détective Consultant de l'Univers ? Ou est-ce que je devrai me contenter de t'imaginer en Chat porte-bonheur boudeur ?Dis-moi plus à propos de toi. Ta vie, tes intérêts, les choses que tu fais quand tu n'es pas sur une affaire, les gens que tu aimes – tout et n'importe quoi. Je voudrais qu'on ait eu l'occasion de se rencontrer à Noël dernier, Sherlock. Londres me manque, tu sais. C'est ta faute, quelque part. J'ai perpétuellement une envie viscérale d'y être, alors qu'avant je n'avais le mal du pays que de temps à autre. La pluie me manque, les nuits pleines de brouillards me manquent, bordel, même les matins nuageux et moroses de Londres me manquent ! Ici c'est le désert, le soleil sans pitié, il n'y a pas la moindre tiédeur dans cette chaleur suffocante. Mais je suis toujours content. J'ai ces débiles qui sont comme des frères pour moi, et un ami brillant qui adore me faire des compliments cachés en pensant que je suis trop stupide pour les entendre. C'est un petit con désobligeant, mais je ne voudrais surtout pas qu'il soit autrement.Je sais que tu as un penchant pour l'imprudence mais essaie de rester en vie jusqu'à ce que je rentre à la maison, d'accord ? Ecris vite. Prends soin de toi.Bien à toi,John.PS : je t'envoie quelques photos de groupe sur lesquelles j'apparais. Je ne te dis pas où je suis ; déduis-le. J'espère que tu ne m'en veux pas. AO-O-OA Il pleuvait. Une de ces nuits humides et typiques de Londres. Pourtant, savoir que quelqu'un les regrettait de tout son cœur, loin là-bas, rendait cette nuit spéciale, quelque part. C'était surprenant de voir comme un simple changement de perspective pouvait transformer quelque chose d'indésirable en un manque. Sherlock se leva lentement de sa chaise et se tint devant la fenêtre. Il était en congé, cette nuit. Lestrade lui avait téléphoné plus tôt, mais il avait estimé que l'affaire était trop ennuyeuse pour être digne de son attention. Et maintenant, il était là, dans l'obscurité, regardant les gouttes de pluie glisser sur la vitre et pensant à une certaine personne.Emotions, sentiments – des concepts totalement étrangers à Sherlock. Il s'entraînait à mettre à distance de lui toutes ces choses qui ne pouvaient que provoquer la douleur, au final. Il ne parvenait pas à se souvenir de la dernière fois où il s'était volontairement tenu devant un appareil photo. Pas après Maman. Mais le voilà qui jouait le jeu d'une requête stupide et sentimentale posée par quelqu'un qui voyait clair à travers le mur que Sherlock avait bâti autour de lui. Quelqu'un qui n'avait pas que fait ami-ami avec lui, mais qui, au delà de ça, affirmait qu'il ne voudrait pas que Sherlock soit autrement. ''Idiot.'' Un murmure plein de tendresse. Sherlock posa la paume de sa main sur la vitre, absorbant sa fraîcheur. Il la retira au bout de quelques secondes. Les lumières de l'extérieur soulignaient ses empreintes sur le verre. Sherlock se demanda à quoi les empreintes digitales de John ressemblaient. John lui avait demandé de l'identifier sur ses photos de groupes, mais il ne savait pas que le détective savait déjà à quoi il ressemblait. Peu après avoir connu John, Sherlock avait hacké l'ordinateur de Mycroft et accédé au dossier de carrière de John H. Watson. Mais de toute façon, même si Sherlock ne l'avait pas su, il aurait trouvé John sur ces photos. Ce visage honnête et franc, ce sourire brillant ne pouvaient qu'appartenir au soldat gentil et courageux qui demandait à Sherlock de rester en vie jusqu'à ce qu'il rentre chez lui. C'était un promesse, n'est-ce pas ? La pensée que les compliments de quelqu'un d'autre aient pu faire sourire John hérissa Sherlock, mais bon, c'était à lui que John avait pensé quand il les avait lus. John ne se lasserait pas de lui, John ne l'abandonnerait pas, n'est-ce pas ? Sherlock ne pouvait qu'espérer et attendre le jour où John tiendrait sa promesse.Il resta debout longtemps, perdu dans des pensées de ces jours passés, et de ceux à venir. Et sur la table, la photo d'un jeune soldat à la peau hâlée par le soleil et au sourire chaleureux illuminait la pièce plongée dans l'obscurité, de ce halo semblable à un feu perçant de sa chaleur les nuits froides comme celle-ci. ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

Je suis donc heureux de te savoir en pleine santé.AJohn, j'ai tiré des enseignements de mes erreurs et je peux par conséquent t'assurer que je ne fais rien qui puisse mettre ma vie en danger plus que nécessaire. Mais je dois admettre que tu as un vocabulaire très coloré. Quoi qu'il en soit, n'épuise pas ton petit cerveau en t'inquiétant pour moi, tu as d'autres choses plus importantes qui reposent sur toi, surtout maintenant que tu as quelqu'un d'autre pour satisfaire ton besoin de materner. J'imagine que ses compliments te plaisent aussi. Toutefois, je dois te faire savoir que je n'aime pas qu'on me compare à quelqu'un d'autre. Je ne suis peut-être pas la personne idéale, mais intellectuellement parlant, je suis supérieur à la plupart, et il est certain que je n'ai rien en commun avec un crétin de dix-sept ans piégé en désintox. Si j'étais toi, je ne prendrais même pas la peine de gaspiller du papier et de l'encre pour lui. J'imagine que tu n'es pas moi. Mais, ''type relativement correct'', vraiment, John ? Je ne pensais pas qu'il était si facile de te faire plaisir.ATu as le sourire le plus franc et idiot qui existe, tu savais ça ? Tu es un livre ouvert, John. Si tu m'avais envoyé une photo d'un groupe de cinquante personnes au lieu de seulement cinq, je t'aurais quand même trouvé, et sans aucun effort. Et tu as le logo de la Royal Army Medical College imprimé sur l'uniforme de ta chemise, aussi, ce que les autres n'ont pas. Sur la photographie sur laquelle vous êtes cinq, debout devant une tente, le gars derrière toi éprouve une sorte d'intérêt romantique envers toi. Oui, John, je t'ai déduit et je sais que tu es le deuxième type en partant de la gauche. Depuis le début de mon existence, je vis à la recherche de mystères, et voilà que je me retrouve coincé avec quelqu'un qui ressemble exactement à ses lettres et qui sourit à l'appareil photo comme s'il était dans un élevage de chatons à adopter et non à la guerre. Ma vie est misérable.AJe ne vois pas comment connaître des détails fastidieux de ma vie pourra t'être bénéfique, mais comme je suis un homme plutôt généreux, je vais exaucer ton vœu. En voici quelques uns :AJ'ai grandi dans le Sussex, nous avons notre maison là-bas.AJ'ai suivi l'école à la maison suite à mon échec à réduire mon QI de façon à l'adapter aux stratégies pédagogiques atroces de l'école.AJ'ai été reçu à Cambridge pour y étudier la Chimie mais j'ai dû arrêter pour divers raisons.AJ'ai plus de connaissances en Chimie Organique que la plupart des professeurs de l'Université. (A vrai dire, j'ai plus de connaissances sur presque tout que la plupart des gens)AJe fais des expériences quand je ne suis pas sur une affaire. J'ai un approvisionnement constant en membres humains grâce à l'hôpital de St. Barts ; Molly s'assure que ce soit toujours le cas.AJe joue du violon.AParfois, je ne parle pas pendant des jours entiers.AJe déteste les médecins. Mais je pourrais donner le bénéfice du doute aux médecins de l'armée.AJ'ai été cliniquement diagnostiqué comme Sociopathe, mais je préfère qu'on dise de moi que je suis un sociopathe de haut niveau.AJe hais la stupidité sous toutes ses formes et de toute variété.AJe ne suis pas quelqu'un qui a des amis, je n'en ai qu'un.AJe ne suis pas 'boudeur' et je ne me renfrogne pas.AJe suis quelqu'un de très bien et très responsable. Je suis encore plus intéressant quand on correspond avec moi de façon prolongée.AJ'espère que ce sera suffisant pour étancher ta soif d'informations.ATu recevras une photographie de moi parmi quelques autres images dans cette lettre. Mais je refuse catégoriquement de t'envoyer la moindre photo de Mycroft. Il semblerait que tu éprouves un intérêt démesuré pour mon frère, ce qui est suspicieux, pour ne pas dire plus. Premièrement tu me demandes de le remercier de ta part, puis tu me demandes des photos de lui... Que se passe-t-il John ? Il t'a contacté ? Il t'a menacé ? Ne me mens pas, John. Dis-moi immédiatement s'il a fait quoi que ce soit. Et si ce n'est pas le cas, je t'interdis d'établir la moindre liaison avec mon ennemi juré.AJ'aimerais voir tes empreintes digitales. Elles sont très intéressantes, tu sais, signature unique pour chaque individu. J'aimerais pouvoir voir les tiennes, pour la Recherche, bien entendu. Et je voudrais te remercier, John, d'avoir partagé tes photographies avec moi. J'apprécie énormément ce geste. Je les conserverai avec le plus grand soin. Mais n'attends pas de moi que je les accroche au mur ou les encadre. Je te sais susceptible des plus atroces fantasmes.APrends soin de toi. Essaie de ne pas perdre un membre, mais si jamais tu te faisais couper un orteil, essaie de me le faire parvenir. J'ai besoin d'orteils humains. Et arrête de pleurer comme un personnage de roman à l'eau de rose victorien : nous aurons d'autres Noël pour nous voir. D'ici là, continue de m'écrire.AAmicalement,ASherlock.APS : Ses sentiments romantiques, les réciproques-tu ?A AAO-O-OAA AAMerde.AAPutain de bordel de putain de merde. Ces mots exacts furent ceux qui vinrent à l'esprit de John lorsqu'il vit la première photo. Dessus, un garçon, oui, un Garçon de dix-huit ou dix-neuf ans se tenait devant une gigantesque cheminée, dans un costume, un foutu costume noir avec une chemise violette. Mais ce n'était pas tout. Ce fut le visage qui cloua John. Une peau d'albâtre, de hautes pommettes séduisantes, de façon insensée, des boucles foncées stylées (bien sûr qu'elles étaient stylées ! Rien ne l'était pas, dans cette photo) d'une manière ''minutieusement négligée'', des lèvres en cœur dont l'inférieure, charnue, affichait une moue boudeuse. Ce garçon était plutôt maigre mais, bordel, il était grand. La seule chose qui rejoignait ce que John avait imaginé de Sherlock était le léger froncement de sourcil un peu arrogant. Une main coincée dans la poche, l'autre reposant sur le dossier d'une chaise qui aurait eu sa place à Buckingham Palace. Tout dans cette photo, dans cette pièce, criait l'élégance hautement distinguée et au centre se tenait Sherlock Holmes, royalement, en sombre prince. Etait-ce même bien Sherlock ? Bien sûr que c'était lui ! Un mec nommé Sherlock et dont le frère s'appelait Mycroft devait définitivement ressembler à ça. A quoi John s'attendait-il !? John lécha ses lèvres sèches, déglutit durement et passa inconsciemment ses doigts dans ses cheveux ébouriffés. Il ne parvenait pas à s'empêcher de comparer la photo de Sherlock à la sienne et cette pensée le décomposait. Soudain, il se sentit reconnaissant de ne pas avoir pu rencontrer Sherlock le soir de Noël. John savait qu'il n'avait pas à se plaindre, physiquement, la douzaine de propositions qu'on lui avait faites à la fac le lui confirmaient, mais ça, c'était une toute autre ligue. Sherlock était un putain de bel homme ? Garçon ? Avec l'esprit d'un génie, alors que John n'était rien d'autre que John.A AAMerde.AACa, c'était la première réaction de John après avoir vu la seconde photo. Sherlock avait écrit à l'arrière de la photo : ''notre maison familiale dans le Sussex, où j'ai grandi.'' Sherlock a grandi dans... dans un manoir ?! Putain de bordel à con de merde ! La mère de John avait une copie du livre Orgueil et Préjugés de Jane Austen, dans laquelle il y avait un dessin de la maison de Darcy à Pemberly. Cette photo ramena ce souvenir d'enfance à l'esprit de John. Il n'aurait pas du être surpris, puisque l'apparence de Sherlock s'accordait parfaitement avec cette maison, mais quand même... un manoir ?!A AAMerde.AACa, c'était pour la dernière photo. John était toujours absolument stupéfait par les deux première photos, sinon il aurait trouvé quelque chose de plus agréable à dire de cette nouvelle image. C'était une photo d'une nuit pluvieuse. Prise en hauteur. Elle montrait une rue trempée de pluie où les lumières se mêlaient avec le rideau de gouttes, peignant des motifs d'art moderne avec la rue pour toile. La pluie était toujours diluvienne quand la photo avait été prise. Quelque chose de chaud enfla dans le cœur de John, et sa poitrine était serrée. Soudain, il réalisa que sa respiration était devenue lourde et que ses yeux le piquaient. Sherlock lui avait envoyé une pluie de Londres par cette photo. Il lui avait envoyé un bout de son chez lui. Il l'avait envoyé pour faire sourire John.A AJohn s'affala dans son lit en serrant les photos et la lettre contre son sternum. Sa tête était bourdonnante et il ferma les yeux.AC'était quelqu'un que John avait rencontré par hasard et qui avait instantanément capté son intérêt ; c'était quelqu'un qui lui donnait de l'espoir, c'était quelqu'un avec qui il voulait créer des souvenirs ; c'était quelqu'un qui, bien qu'étant à des milliers de kilomètres de lui, faisait de son mieux pour le rendre heureux, comme si le bonheur de John comptait pour lui, comme si John comptait. C'était Sherlock Holmes.ACette lettre n'était pas du tout Sherlockienne. John savait que Sherlock s'ouvrait graduellement, mais après avoir lu cette lettre, il ne savait qu'en penser. Ce n'était pas seulement franc, il y avait aussi quelque chose d'autre. Quelqu'un chose que John n'osait pas pas pointer du doigt. Des questions rampaient autour de sa pensée. Sherlock semblait vraiment furieux à propos du gamin en désintox. John avait voulu l'agacer un peu, clairement, mais il ne s'attendait pas à le mettre en colère à ce point. C'était presque comme si Sherlock était... était jaloux ! Sherlock était jaloux ? Non, ça ne pouvait pas être ça. Sherlock, qui vivait dans un manoir, qui était le seul Détective Consultant, qui semblait tout droit sorti d'un magazine de mode, ne pouvait pas être jaloux parce que John écrivait des lettres à quelqu'un d'autre. Non, l'idée était totalement absurde, hein ? Mais il n'y avait pas d'autre raison évidente à son irritation. John était profondément troublé.ADans sa lettre, Sherlock racontait des informations sur sa vie. Il n'était pas obligé de le faire juste parce que John le lui demandait, mais il l'avait fait malgré tout. Connaissant Sherlock, ce n'était pas seulement surprenant mais adorable. Mais ces nouvelles données rendaient John encore plus confus et un peu inquiet. Qu'est-ce que Sherlock voulait dire quand il écrivait qu'il n'était pas quelqu'un qui avait des amis ? John était-il son seul ami ? Sherlock se voyait lui-même comme un sociopathe ? C'était une blague ou pas ? Pourquoi ne parlait-il pas pendant des jours, parfois ? Personne ne le faisait-il parler ? N'y avait-il personne dans sa vie que cela dérangeait ? Son frère ? Qu'est-ce que Sherlock pouvait bien faire d'un approvisionnement constant en membres humains ? Et c'était qui, cette Molly ? Ca ne pouvait pas être sa copine, il était gay, hein ? Peut-être la gouvernante ? John grogna de frustration et fit une note mentale pour plus tard pour lui demander tout ça dans sa prochaine lettre.AAlors comme ça, Sherlock le complimentait sur son sourire. Son foutu sourire ! Il le complimentait sur un truc si quelconque ! Bon, le compliment était très Sherlockien, bien sûr, mais ça n'en était pas moins surprenant. John sentait ses joues bien trop rouges pour son ego. Il était soulagé d'être seul.AMais ce qui terrassa John, ce fut quand il lu la partie où Sherlock (sans avoir l'air d'y toucher, encore) souhaitait pouvoir voir ses empreintes digitales. Venant de quiconque d'autre, une telle requête aurait parut étrange, voire flippant, mais John sentit son estomac se remplir de papillons. Premièrement, savoir que Sherlock voulait connaître John au delà de ses lettres était un sentiment glorieux, mais qu'il veuille quelque chose qui était l'essence de John, vif, pur et unique, sans mérite extérieur, l'électrisa plus encore. L'émotion derrière ce désir de Sherlock semblait si intense pour John qu'il eut du mal à respirer. Il inspira profondément pour essayer de calmer les battements de son cœur. Et quand il parvint à les ralentir, il réalisa quelque chose avec un choc. Il était foutu, hein ?AAMerde.AA AAO-O-OAA AAStop ! Qu'est-ce que Sherlock voulait dire par 'réciproquer' les sentiments de Murr' ?AAAMerde. Merde. Merde.AA ",A Promise To Keep - trad,10994

It's just something that happens between people. Sex is one of the most powerful forces in the universe” - here Sherlock snorted dismissively - “ yes, it is, <i>IT IS</i>, but it's also entirely inexplicable. It's not to be understood. It's to be experienced.”","A“But why, John?“ Sherlock nearly wailed, a strange sound when uttered in a deep baritone.A“Well, that's actually a bit hard to explain to someone who … you know ...” John trailed off, his hands gesturing vaguely up and down, indicating in Sherlock's general direction.A“No, I don't know, that's precisely why I'm asking”, was the scathing retort John's sensible reaction gained him.A“And that's supposed to be the problem in a nutshell.” John deadpanned.ASherlock looked at him somewhat bewildered, then shook his head briskly, marvellously achieving to convey his impatience, before walking over to his chair, where he flopped graciously down, his arms dangling languidly on either side, his long legs stretched out in front of him, crossed at the ankles.A“Why do people make such a fuss about it?” He huffed desperately. “It's not only distasteful, it's ridiculous … and vulgar.”A“Yes, and pedestrian, and mundane, and tawdry, and maudlin, and carnal ...” John rattled off in his best mock-Sherlock-voice (which wasn't very convincing, to be honest, but always set the detective off none the less). He was prevented from continuing his litany by a Union-Jack-pillow hitting him in the face.A“Stop poking fun at me. I asked you a reasonable question, Doctor Watson!”A“Seriously, Sherlock, that's not something one can explain...”A“You mean you can't explain. Or, should I say, won't?” Sherlock snarled.AJohn felt his face flush. For fuck's sake, he was an adult, a grown man – something he wasn't entirely sure off regarding his present opponent – so he should be able to talk about this specific subject without blushing like a spotty adolescent. Then he reviewed his choice of words and winced inwardly. Freud would have had a field day.A“Look, Sherlock, for someone with your attitude...” he began soothingly, only to be interrupted yet again.A“What do you know about my attitude?” Sherlock exploded, bouncing off his chair. Suddenly, he stood in the middle of their living room, obviously agitated, but also kind of lost despite all his raging fury. He turned his face away from John, staring out of the window, his lips pressed tightly shut as if to stop himself from blurting out something he might later regret, his fists compulsorily clenching and unclenching.AAll of a sudden, the flat was filled with an awkward silence.A“The point I was trying to make...” John started tentatively, but was cut short as Sherlock brushed off his remark with an icy “Never mind”, before striding towards his room, closing the door firmly behind him.A---------------------------------------A“Sherlock?” John knocked at his flatmate's bedroom door some fifteen minutes later, which wasn't that easily accomplished because, at the same time, he tried to balance two cups of tea without spilling the hot liquid all over his hands.AAs his efforts elicited no answer, he started to use his foot, kicking vehemently against the unyielding wood, to persuasively convey that he wouldn't be put off by passive-aggressive pouting.A“Sherlock, I know that you are in there. Please, spare me damaging our interiors any further. You do that enough for both of us.”ASilence.A“Jesus fucking Christ, you know what, I'm coming in.”AJohn took both mugs in one hand, nearly scalding his fingers, and turned the knob. He was aware of his intrusion being some kind of trespass; never before had he just bounced into his flatmate's bedroom uninvited. John tried to reassure himself that the man he was about to walk in on never gave a toss about other people's privacy or personal space, but that somehow didn't help. He was still uneasy and self-conscious as he imagined Sherlock lying still and almost corpse-like on his bed, long pale fingers stifled under his chin, while he pushed the door open.ABut the sight awaiting him had nothing remotely in common with what he had been envisaging.ASherlock sat on his bed, his head in his hands, his fingers tousled in his dark curls, but his face jerked up as he realised that John was really about to enter his room, eyes dark and burning with some strange mix of emotions – anger, shame, fear? John couldn't tell, because in a split second, Sherlock put the smooth blasé mask in place he choose to wear when talking to less important witnesses or someone from NSY.AThe two men stared at one another actually a bit embarrassed, until John handed Sherlock his tea.A“Here, just the way you like it.” John's voice sounded too loud in the dim room.A“Thank you.” Sherlock took the mug, but did not drink.AJohn was the first to avert his gaze. He let his eyes roam, taking in details he'd never recognised before: Sherlock's table lamp on his nightstand (a cylindrical thing, crafted of clear glass and nickel-plated metal, probably original Bauhaus); the framed period table on the far wall; a photograph of an Irish Setter on his chest of drawers where other people might have displayed their beloved family members.AThe bed was unmade, some clothes left carelessly strewn on the floor (how on earth could a man who placed so much emphasis on his appearance care so little about the state of his expensive gear?). And right in the middle of this mess sat his slightly dishevelled and rather forlorn flatmate, still watching John intently while displaying a look of utter disinterest to hide being completely at sea.AEventually, John squared his shoulders and stood to attention – he was a soldier, after all – addressing the issue simmering between them straight on:A“Listen, Sherlock, passion and desire are just not things one can rationally explain. It's just something that happens between people. Sex is one of the most powerful forces in the universe” - here Sherlock snorted dismissively - “ yes, it is, IT IS, but it's also entirely inexplicable. It's not to be understood. It's to be experienced.”ASherlock still looked at him, suddenly wide awake, blinking a few times, before asking: “Are you offering?” He sounded wary, but also intrigued.AJohn's whole world turned upside down, but then, he'd always known that this day would finally come, hadn't he, right since their first meeting at Bart's?ASo, he just nodded, thought briefly “Into battle”, before stepping over towards the crouched figure on the bed, standing too close, running his fingers through surprisingly thick dark curls for a minute to brace himself, and then finally leaned in, pressing his mouth onto chafed, but also quite plush lips, sensing stubble and reluctance and uncertainty and … oh … reciprocation?!AJesus, kissing Sherlock Holmes felt both more familiar and weirder than he had imagined.A“Have you ever done this before?” He had to ask this question, even if he doubted that the answer would have any effect on the course of the evening.A“Yes.” Sherlock looked at him rather gobsmacked, a very rare sight, and therefore to be savoured tenderly.A“Good, that's … good … actually.” John was glad he had not violated an inexperienced virgin.A“In primary school, with Alice Munroe. We were both seven, so that might explain why we did not take things any further.”AJohn's stomach dropped.ASHIT!A“So, you have never … ever … anything … oh my god!?” John suddenly felt a little sick.A“Well, that's why I was asking. I need data, preferably acquired with someone I trust.”A“Preferably?” John echoed weakly.A“You know, if needs be...”A“For the love of god, do not finish this sentence!”ASherlock's mouth clamped shut.AThey rested their foreheads against each other while John's thumb gently stroked one of Sherlock's prominent cheekbones.A“Are you amenable?” Sherlock asked after a few moments of just breathing and stroking and appreciating and adjusting.A“Oh god, yes.” John whispered.ASherlock chuckled.A“What?”AIt started to develop into an uncontrolled giggle.A“Sorry, it's just … I'm nervous?” It was more a question than a statement, telling an awful lot about Sherlock's state of mind. The man was never unsure, let alone diffident.A“If you do not want to proceed, just tell me, it's fine...” John felt his own courage falter a little.A“No!” was the answer he got – perhaps just a fraction too quick.A“Okay.” John waited a heartbeat to give Sherlock time to recede his consent. Of course, the git didn't.A“If you honestly want to go on, you should get undressed.”A“Just like that?” Sherlock sounded rather disappointed.A“Well, I could assist you, if you'd like?”ASherlock just gave a short nod.A“Well, okay, then...”AJohn started to unbutton Sherlock's shirt with shaky hands, fumbling a little with the top button, caressing the bared skin with his fingertips. He had to kneel down in front of the man - between his spread thighs, to be precise - before long, to level their difference in height. Sherlock’s fingers gripped the sheets at either side of his rather rigid body, as John’s hands moved over the smooth planes of his chest, his fingertips bumping over protruding ribs, stroking hard abs.ASherlock didn't seem to mind, but wasn't fully committed either, until John bit down at his collarbone. In reaction, Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath, looking down at John from eyes blown wide.A“Do that again!” he demanded, and John only too willingly obliged, giddy for having discovered something Sherlock genuinely wanted.A“You like it rough, then?” he asked under his breath, only to be rewarded with the obvious answer: “How would I know?”A“Oh, never mind, we'll figure it out.” After that, there wasn't much talking for a long time, because John started to kiss Sherlock in earnest, biting and sucking at his lips until he caught on and opened his mouth just a little, to let John's inquisitive tongue slip in, stroking, exploring, caressing, nipping, until he elicited a passionate groan from the world's only consulting detective.A“You like that, don't you?” John breathed.ASherlock just hummed in approval.A“Tell me!” John’s lips moved down Sherlock’s long throat, so he could feel him swallowing before he heard the answer.A“Yes, I like that.” It sounded breathy and a little bit startled.A“God, your voice…” John mumbled against hot moist skin, licking up Sherlock’s neck all the way to his ear, sucking and biting at the lobe until he felt Sherlock’s hands on his shoulders, clutching in a strong, nearly painful grip.AJohn pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s sweaty temple and inhaled deeply to calm himself down a little. Then, he leaned back and opened Sherlock’s cufflinks, one at a time, pressing his lips against the inside of each wrist, sucking slightly at the delicate skin, before he pulled Sherlock’s shirt off his bony shoulders; John noticed the joints protruding beneath taut white skin.A“Lie down”, he whispered, and Sherlock almost toppled back onto the mattress. His hair surrounded his face like a dark halo, but his eyes were pressed tightly shut, and his fists twisted in the duvet again.A“Hey, relax.” John crawled up next to Sherlock onto the bed, his knees already killing him from crouching down on the hard floor. He smoothed his left palm over Sherlock’s chest and down his abdomen, pausing just above the waist of his slim black trousers. Then, he stroked his fingertips upwards again, feeling the fine dust of hair travelling down from Sherlock’s navel.A“Can’t.” Sherlock pressed the word out between strained lips.A“This is not how it’s supposed to be.” John remarked doubtfully.A“Isn’t it?” Sherlock opened one eye and arched a prominent eyebrow, achieving to look overwhelmed and inquisitive at the same time.AJohn laughed a little.A“No. You should actually enjoy this.”A“Ok, I’ll keep that in mind. Now, come on, hurry up!” Sherlock screwed his eye shut again and appeared even more tense than before.AJohn stilled.A“What?” Sherlock asked sharply as he noticed that John’s hands weren’t moving anymore.A“I can’t do it like this.” John declared, sliding away from Sherlock’s stiff body until there were a good few inches of space between them.ASherlock propped himself up on his pointy elbows, glaring sulkily down at John.A“Why not? You’ve had your fair share of rather frigid girlfriends, at least you used to bemoan their lack of interest in frequent sexual encounters at great length, so you should be used to not overly enthusiastic bedfellows. Don’t you become squeamish with me right now.”A“Could you please refrain from insulting my sexually confident and self-determined ex-lovers as frigid just because they did not want to shag me six ways to Sunday?” John started to fluster. He should have known that Sherlock bloody Holmes would ruin even his first time with a combination of aggravating impatience and unhealthy demanding behaviour; the idiot had no idea what he was doing, but that had never stopped the brat from acting a right gobshite.A“I don’t see why…”A“Shut up, Sherlock!”A“… as you himself labelled them like that, and, as you are a medical man …”A“Sherlock, I swear to god, if you do not shut it right now …”A“… I thought I could rely on your expertise in this matter, with all the boasting about Three Continent Watson, but … oh, perhaps it weren’t actually the females, it could have been some form of erectile dysfunction on your part, as you were probably more interested in the male anatomy. Did you tell them to turn around and shut out the lights, so you could pretend it was me you were fucking up the arse?” His innocent tone barely disguised the acerbic content of his words.AJohn had gone very still during this scathing deduction, just staring at Sherlock and wondering how the mood could have changed so completely within five minutes.A“I can imagine they thought that quite strange.” Sherlock went on, oblivious to John’s obvious discomfort. “Perhaps you even said my name during intercourse. I expect that to be quite a turn-down.”AJohn’s face had gone white. Hot anger started to boil up inside him.A“How dare you…” he bellowed, before he flung himself on top of Sherlock, knocking his arms from under him, pressing him down with both his hands grabbing tightly at Sherlock’s wrists – which he had kissed just moments earlier – pinning them above his head.ABut that did not remotely silence his flatmate, who was now in his element, deducing at high speed, not caring if he insulted or offended the man he had tried to take to bed just half an hour ago.A“Did they refuse you? Did they struggle? Did they tell you to stop? But you didn’t.”A“Shut up!” John yelled, grabbing Sherlock’s arms so hard he was sure to bruise. He pushed down with all the force he could muster, to stop Sherlock from fidgeting underneath him, and … oh?AAOh!AASherlock was hard.AJohn could feel it through the fabric of both their trousers.ASherlock Holmes was rubbing his rod-hard cock against John Watson’s thigh.ASomething in John’s brain short-circuited.AHe looked down at Sherlock.AHis pupils were dilated.AHe was squirming.ABut he wasn’t fighting him in earnest.AJust enough to cause some friction.ASherlock met his eyes.A“Rough, remember?” he whispered breathless.A“God, you…”AJohn smashed his mouth onto Sherlock’s demandingly, claiming it by pushing his tongue in as deep as possible.ASherlock strained up to meet him, moaning, until John started to bite down his neck, leaving red marks, then licking and sucking up the delicate skin on the inside of Sherlock’s bare arms, still pinned above his head with his wrists pressed into the mattress.AJohn grinded his groin firmly against Sherlock’s cock, and both men gasped.A“I’m going to fuck you.” John mumbled in Sherlock’s ear. “I’m going to fuck you until you scream.”A“Given that my body is absolutely not used to such a treatment, that won’t take much effort on your part.”A“Stop talking right now. You have a disquieting tendency to spoil the mood.”A“Is that so?”A“Yes.” John groaned, then moved south until his tongue encircled one of Sherlock’s already peaked nipples before biting down, eliciting some rather embarrassingly needy noises from the man below him. He sucked and lapped until he was sure he could hear Sherlock begging.A“What did you say?” John raised his head and took in the sight: Sherlock’s cheeks were glowing pink, a deep flush spreading down his neck, some curls clinging to his moist forehead and temples.A“Please, John, fuck me.” Sherlock moaned as an answer, and as that had been precisely John’s intent anyway, he moved back a little to hastily take of his shirt – Sherlock’s long fingers not really aiding by pushing the fabric up impatiently – and to unzip, pulling down his trousers, pants and socks in one go, before starting on Sherlock’s belt and fly.AJohn yanked the remaining clothing off, savouring the sight of Sherlock’s wiry body stretched out in front of him, his hands still placed rather enticingly above his head.AJohn took himself in hand and slowly started to stroke his hard shaft while straddling Sherlock’s thighs, who watched mesmerised until a drop of clear precome dripped onto his flat stomach.ASherlock sucked in his breath, trembling.AJohn bowed down, bracing himself with his free right hand onto the mattress near Sherlock’s head, and started kissing his wet hot mouth again, more tenderly this time, at least at first. But it got heated very quickly, especially as John wrapped his left hand around both their cocks and started wanking them, rubbing their hard flesh together.AJohn was leaking precome copiously by now, but nevertheless removed his left hand long enough for Sherlock to lick his palm – who caught on to the idea fairly rapid, given his obviously dazed state of mind – for the more lubricant, the better (at least in John’s experience).AThinking about it, John suddenly wavered. Up until now, he hadn’t had a very clear concept of where this was heading, despite Sherlock's vivid description of the activities he'd engaged in with his former girlfriends. They had been … well … women. With firm tits and plush bums and soft round hips and silky long hair. It had all seemed quite normal, at least to John.ANow, he was setting off in a very different direction: Sherlock was everything but plush or curvy or soft. He was lanky, wiry, ripped – and undoubtedly male; the very evidence of that was actually throbbing against his own hard prick in his tight fist.AJesus Christ. It hit John all at once: he was actually about to fuck Sherlock Holmes up the arse. The prospect made his head spin.A“John, please... I...” Sherlock panted, shivering under John's firm administration.AJohn halted his movements, staring down at Sherlock, equally enthralled and keyed up.A“You alright?” his voice sounded deep and hoarse.A“I … I … don't … know?” Sherlock Holmes stammering clueless – now, that was quite a turn-up for the books.AJohn gently removed his hand and bent down to kiss Sherlock softly, nipping ever so lightly at his bottom lip.A“Do you, by chance, have any lube at hand?” John murmured against Sherlock's mouth as the man beneath him had calmed down a bit.A“What?”A“Lubricant, Sherlock.”A“What for?”AAOh.My.God.AA“To slick … things … up a bit.”A“What things?”A“Do you honestly not know, or are you just playing obtuse?”A“That's usually my line.” Sherlock smiled, slowly coming back online again.A“And that's not an answer to my question.” John insisted, fearing the worst.A“John, don't get your knickers in a twist.” They both snickered at this rather pointless remark. “I am perfectly aware of the mechanics, so to speak, male-male intercourse requires.”A“We'll really have to work on your pillow talk.” John intersected, now likewise much less excited than only a few moments ago.A“But I seriously doubt this precaution necessary.” Sherlock stated.A“You … doubt it necessary?” John sounded incredulous.A“Well, considering your rather average length and not that impressive girth, I am confident to put up with your penis without some artificial chemical substance up my rectum.” Sherlock explained matter-of-factly.A“Now, that's flattering. Honestly, Sherlock, do you think before you open your mouth?”A“Of course I do.” Sherlock protested.A“That was a somewhat rhetorical question. Believe me, we'll need lube. Lots of lube. And condoms.”ASherlock rolled his eyes dramatically.A“This is not debatable. Haemoproctia is not only very painful and quite risky, it's also deeply embarrassing. Nurses love to take the piss. Gives them something to giggle over at the Christmas do.”A“But I'm neither in the possession of any of this.”A“But I am.” John hastily climbed out of bed. “Don't go anywhere.”A“Do I look like leaving this room any time soon?”A“I never know with you...” John smiled back down at Sherlock, before literally running up the stairs to rummage through the drawer of his nightstand, frantically searching for the small bottle of lube he knew he kept stored there for personal entertainment, so to speak, and strongly hoping to find a Durex as well. He wasn't sure if he still retained condoms, as he hadn't needed one lately due to a distinct dry spell regarding dates.AHe finally located the discretely labelled and still half-full bottle, but his hunt for a sheath revealed – nothing.AAFuck! AAWell, actually not.AJohn banged his head once against his own sheets in utter despair, before scrambling to his feet to go back down again, where Sherlock was waiting for him to fulfil his rather cocky promise.AAs he entered the downstairs bedroom, Sherlock was slowly stroking himself with one delicate pale hand, his glans appearing dark red and shining wet every time it pushed out of his fist.AJohn's mouth went dry, and his breath hitched.A“You took your time.” Sherlock complained in a low voice.A“I … sorry … Keep going.”AJohn approached the bed deliberately slowly, savouring the quite obscene but utterly hot sight of Sherlock Holmes touching himself.A“Did you bring the … supplies … you so vehemently insisted on?” Sherlock tried for a snide remark, but somehow failed, due to his very obvious arousal.A""Partly.” John confessed while getting back into bed, pushing Sherlock's legs up until his knees were nearly at his shoulders. Sherlock watched this incredulous, but did neither question nor oppose John's action. Only his hand on his cock stilled, hovering unsure between his legs. He had absolutely no idea what John was about to do to him. Admittedly, he felt rather exposed, but not in an awkward way, just verbatim, with his spindly legs spread wide.AThat's why Sherlock's eyes rolled back in his head when John pressed his tongue flat against his tight puckered whole. He didn't see that coming. To be honest, he hadn’t even been aware of the fact that people did ... this ... to one another. But never being one to fret about appropriate behaviour in general and hygiene in particular, he could easily admit to himself that he enjoyed John's administrations very much.ASherlock's hand started to move again up and down his cock, but he had to stop when John pushed the tip of his tongue firmly into Sherlock's arsehole. The loud moan he uttered should have embarrassed him, but he was far to spaced out to care.AAfter a few minutes of sucking, licking and lapping, John had reduced the world’s only consulting detective to a panting, quivering mess.A""Please, John, god, please ... just fuck me!""A""Can't."" John huffed against moist, musky skin, before licking a long swipe all the way down Sherlock's cleft.A""What? Why?"" Sherlock nearly shouted in disbelieve, his agitation obvious.A""Nwh cndms."" Was the muffled answer he got, so he pulled John's head up between his legs by his short blond hair, to yell at him: ""What's the point if you are not going to fuck me?""A""No condoms."" John clarified, his face hot and wet from his previous occupation, saliva glistening on his chin.A""I don't care."" Sherlock growled.A""Yes, you do."" John declared.A""No, I don't. I know for a fact that you are safe and healthy. You get tested on a regular basis, because you are a doctor and a responsible adult. And I'm a virgin. Also, the chances of contracting HIV or any other STD on just one occasion are pretty slim. And even if this happens, there's potent medication available if one is prepared to pay for it, so one can live...""A""Stop right now!"" John sounded horrified.A""But it's true..."" Sherlock started to protest, but was cut short by John.A""Ok, if you don't care; but I do. Even if you've never engaged in ... sex ... "" John, couldn't meet Sherlock's eyes as he continued ""... you used IV, Sherlock."" He sighed apologetically. ""I'm sorry, but I'm not going to take chances with a former junkie.""ASherlock had suddenly gone very quiet.A""Do you trust me?"" he finally asked.A""Not with this, no."" John answered truthfully, finally looking Sherlock in the face.A""I got tested just six weeks ago. It should just have been for Hep C, after the incident with the armed jewellery thief, you remember?"" Of course, John remembered. The thug had knifed Sherlock, slicing up his thigh, only missing the femoral artery by an inch or so, blood dripping down Sherlock's leg, pooling at his feet. ""But somehow, the hospital did the full monty, so I know for a fact that I'm clean. The results are in the left kitchen drawer, if you want to check.""AJohn wavered. He knew that Sherlock Holmes was an accomplished liar, he could spin you a yarn without so much as blushing. And John also knew that Sherlock would not hesitate to go to any length to get what he wanted - in this case, John's hard cock up his arse.AOn the other hand, John was well aware that Sherlock cared deeply for him, and wouldn't put his life deliberately at risk.AHe had to make a choice, and it had to be a quick one: trust Sherlock and probably endanger his health, or doubt him and surely put him off sex in general and sex with John Watson in particular for the time being.ASod it! If he hadn't seen such riches he might go on living with being poor. But having tasted the sweet and intoxicating prospect of shagging Sherlock Holmes thoroughly, John cast all warnings to the wind, just nodding in defeat and consent.AIt took Sherlock a moment to catch on, but as it finally dawned on him what John meant, he pulled him further up by his hair, kissing him deep and passionate, tasting his own scent on John's tongue.AWhen they had to part for breath, Sherlock tentatively inquired. ""So, about the anal penetration...?""AJohn chuckled. ""You are such a smoochy romantic, you gorgeous thing."" Sherlock smiled catlike, looking smug and rather pleased with himself.A""Well, go on, then."" Sherlock purred, spreading his legs even wider to encourage John to just shove home.A""It's not that easy, you know.""A""John, for god's sake, could you please just stop fussing, and get it on!"" Sherlock harshly demanded.A""You'll need some preparation.""A""No, I'm ready. Watch me, I'm ready. I am so very ready, I ... ah!"" Sherlock sucked in his breath sharply as John pressed just the tip of his index finger up his virginal hole.A""Trust me, I'm a doctor. I did plenty of prostate examination, I know about these things. Just relax.""AAfter that, John generously lubed up his finger, pressing slowly in; first, just one, then, after Sherlock had stopped fidgeting, a second one. When he could push both of them in deep and move without Sherlock's face contorting in pain, he started to carefully scissor them, until he could finally press a third finger in. He watched mesmerised as Sherlock's tight hole stretched around his fingers, reddening and swelling, but finally loose and slack enough that John could envisage his cock replacing his digits.ASherlock's body was flushed pink down to his navel, sweat glistening on his long white limbs, his eyes closed, but not squinted tightly shut, but rather displaying a dreamy expression on his face. After overcoming his initial discomfort against the unfamiliar intrusion, he’d moaned loudly and - always demanding - eloquently elaborated what he wanted John to do to him: ""God, John, more, please, I need more, just give me more ... deeper ... fuck, please ... yeah, there. God, how I want you to fuck me, really hard, just buggering me relentlessly, until I nearly pass out, until I see stars. I want you to come inside me, I want to feel you spurting your hot load deep into me, I want ... JESUS!"" That had been the moment John's fingers brushed over Sherlock's prostate, shutting him up quite effectively.A""Do that again!"" were the only words he gasped as he could speak again.A""Always so very bossy."" John mumbled, grinning fondly.AWhen John was eventually sure that Sherlock was truly ready, the only decision left to make was how he would have him. John was aware that, for Sherlock, it would probably be more comfortable on hands and knees, but that would deprive him of watching Sherlock as he entered him. If Sherlock stayed on his back, the experience might be rather inconvenient and slightly painful, but it would reward John with a glimpse of Sherlock’s face as he pushed in.AFortunately, Sherlock was a genius, so he sensed what John was pondering, and told him firmly: ""I’ll stay like this. I want to watch, too."" With that, he rested his legs on John’s broad shoulders.AIt could be really worthwhile to shag somebody with almost no sense of decent and sensible behaviour.ASo, when John finally lined up to push into Sherlock, the two men locked eyes. Both showed clear signs of arousal and excitement, even nervousness, as Sherlock swallowed audibly before nodding, signalling John to proceed. John exhaled, once, then pressed slowly in, watching rather smitten as his hard cock breached Sherlock's sphincter, sinking deeper and deeper inside.AWhen he was half way in, Sherlock made an aching noise, and John stopped, looking up at his face again: Sherlock’s eyes were wide and dark, only a slim silver rim surrounding dark blown pupils; his lips were parted and shining wet, and his hands clawed to the sheets, hanging on for dear life.A""God, John, this is ... strange."" Sherlock confided in a low voice.A""Too much?""A""No, no! Just strange. It hurts a bit, but ... fuck, don't stop. Go on!""AJohn didn't need to be told twice. He gripped Sherlock's slim hips hard and pressed in all the way in one go, until he was seated deeply inside Sherlock, buried to the hilt. He stayed like this until he felt Sherlock's body slightly relax around him, and then pulled out just a bit, only to push back in after a moment. Gradually, he pulled out further, to slam in increasingly hard, until he vigorously buggered a moaning Sherlock, uttering profanities until his vision went white, and he felt himself coming, spurting load after load up Sherlock's tight channel.ASherlock was by now reduced to a sobbing mess. John nearly collapsed above him, but eventually braced himself and pulled out of Sherlock's sore hole, his legs sliding down until his feet rested on the bed with John kneeling between his spread thighs.ASherlock's unspent cock was bopping obscenely up and down, looking achingly hard, his balls already drawn tight against his perineum. John gripped the shaft around the base, and then just swallowed down as much as he could. He didn't give a thought about refined technique or fancy movements, but just sucked fiercely and committed, until he felt Sherlock's cock twitch and pulse, tasting bitter, salty wetness, gulping Sherlock's release down without blinking, savouring the taste.AAfter that, he must have passed out a few moments. He came round resting his head on Sherlock's nearly concave stomach, while long fingers lazily caressed his scalp. ASherlock hadn’t lowered his legs, so John could still glimpse the crack of his arse, thus watching milky liquid oozing out if it. He dipped down to taste it, licking up his own cum, lapping on Sherlock's sore hole until it ran dry.AWhen John finally felt able to move again, he crawled up Sherlock's body, hugging him tight, while pulling the duvet over both of them. They were sweaty and sticky, but both men couldn't care less.ASherlock was already on the brink of sleep, nuzzling into John's neck, desperate for affection and - unbelievable - cuddling. John held him close while whispering sweet nothings into his tousled hair. ""You have no idea how beautiful you are. Your face when I fucked you - so precious. You are gorgeous, you are ...""AA ""John."" Sherlock sighed, and John stilled, waiting for a scathing comment on his performance or a scientific question regarding the amount of sperm released, but all Sherlock uttered was a very tired: ""Shut up.""AAA  ""Of course."" John felt rather embarrassed, having allowed his sentiment to get the better of him. He knew that Sherlock hated sentiment. He'd have to constrain himself in the future.AAA ""No."" Oh, mind-reading then, again. ""I find your commitment rather endearing. It's just that I'm knackered. Can we please just go to sleep?""AAA ""Yes, sure, love."" John mumbled into Sherlock's hair, not giving a second thought to using an actual pet name, and a very telling one too.AAA They could talk later. For all John knew, they had the rest of their lives to figure out the other's proclivities.AAA And wasn't that something to look forward too?AAA- The End -","'Twixt such friends as we, few words suffice",5562

Sometimes you don't realize the importance of those moments until after they've passed. Sometimes you do.,"AAAAAA Failed SurpriseAASherlockAAASherlock Holmes/Molly HooperAAAAHe'd overheard Molly say to one of her friends, somewhat jokingly, that the new ""Say Anything"" moment would be from the Lady Gaga song ""You And I,"" and she'd rather enjoy it if one day she came home to that or something similar. He'd had to force himself to listen to the song repeatedly, which had grated on his ears, but in the end he realized she was most likely talking about the line involving the birthday and the song and the guitar and the lack of clothing. That could be easy enough to replicate, with a few minor changes.It didn't go quite as planned. First of all, he had no intention of playing the Neil Young song because he wanted to play something especially for her, but as he wanted it perfect he stayed up late into the night and so he was exhausted the whole damn day and almost slept through setting up the surprise for Molly. Secondly, he hadn't specified she come to the flat alone, so Mary had gotten quite an eyeful as well. And third, he hadn't expected Molly to have plans for her birthday that were a surprise to him.But in the end, when Molly kissed him passionately and began backing him towards his bedroom, telling him to hell with her plans, she needed him shagging her brains out as many times that evening as he possibly could in as many ways as they could possibly think of, as his fingers were dancing towards the hem of her shirt to lift it up over her head so she could be in as little clothing as he was, so he could touch as much of her bare skin as she was touching of his, he supposed that even with the bumps in the surprise it had turned out all right in the end.AAAThe Most Vivid BrillianceASherlockAAMycroft Holmes/AntheaAAAHe had first seen her in the fog. They had met at a section of Chelsea Physic Garden at a bench; it was safer to meet there than in his office. He had been sitting on the bench, pretending to read the newspaper when the early morning fog had rolled in. It had been an inconvenience, but she had been wearing a vivid red trench coat and had stood out even then.These days she blended in, as was part of her job description. Even at galas and events where women were dripping in jewels she remained unobtrusive, nondescript. At least to everyone but him. To him, she was dazzling, more sparkling than even the most brilliant diamond. No matter who else was in the room, she always was the one who caught his eye, just as she had that morning in the fog.It was distracting, at times, but he would not have it any other way. His darling Andrea, the woman who made him feel more alive in the few scant years he’d known her than he had the whole of his life before her. He was glad he had allowed himself to open his heart to her, to allow her brilliance to light up his life. His life was better for it, as if a fog had lifted, and he was glad for it.AAAA Different Type Of WarAStar Trek: Alternate Original Series/SherlockAAKhan Noonien Singh/Molly HooperAAAShe had never expected to hear him be like this, to be honest. He always seemed so cold, so serious, so dour. Nothing was ever good. Nothing was ever right enough, it seemed. He hated being stuck in this universe, in this era, in this city. She was surprised he stayed, to be honest. She wondered what on earth kept him tethered to London when he seemed to hate it here so much.AAAnd she hadn’t expected to get trapped in the impromptu snowball fight the children were having outside her home. Oh, she’d had fun with them before…him, and his arrival. She’d been keen to join in, but before she could say one thing or the other Jason had hit Khan smack dab in the side of the face with the white mound of snow and everyone just froze. He flicked the powdery white substance off his face and stared at the boy before looking at him.“This means war,” he said after a moment before stooping down and scooping up a handful of snow himself and lobbing it at the boy, hitting him square in the face. And then just like that, the tension was gone, and there were sounds of shrieks and laughter in the air. And when Khan looked at her later, a very small, almost imperceptible grin on her face, she realized why he stayed: for her. He was staying for her.  And that warmed her heart more than she ever thought possible.AAAA Better Fairy TaleASherlockAAJohn Watson/Mary MorstanAAA“And Rapunzel was in her tower, waiting for her prince,” Mary read, and then she frowned. She knew the story. Rapunzel waited, then the prince came, they did their business, she got preggers, witch found out, cut off Rapunzel’s hair, lured the prince up, cast him out, he got blinded…honestly, the Disney version was a million times better. She shut the book and looked over at her daughter. “Mummy could probably come up with a better bedtime story than Rapunzel.”AA“Mummy could always tell her the story about the Princess who met the sad and despondent Prince who’d locked himself away in a tower and kept chipping away at all the defenses and badgered the Prince to get out of the tower and come play with him until one day he did,” John said from the door. And then the Prince and the Princess fell madly in love and got married and became King and Queen and had a Princess of their own.”Mary gave him a warm smile, her heart full of love towards her husband as he came in. “She could,” she said before glancing at the bed. “But I think the little Princess has fallen asleep. But perhaps the King and Queen can go off together and spend some time in their own bedroom? Perhaps trying for a Prince this time?” John gave her a chuckle and offered her his hand, and when she stood up he pulled her close. God, she loved this man more than anything in the world, and she considered herself so lucky that he loved her in return.AAAJust A Little SplurgingASherlockAAIrene Adler/Molly HooperAAAShe would never say that she didn’t love Molly’s sense of style. She loved the cutesy side of her girlfriend, with the cherry print jumper and the floral button down shirts and the occasional bows in her hair. She loved all of that. She didn’t want Molly to always look sleek and polished like she did; that wasn’t who she was. It would be strange to see her in designer clothing all the time. And it wouldn’t be practical for her post, either.AABut there were times when she could dress up, and those were the times that Irene adored because that meant they could go out shopping, and that meant Irene could entice Molly to splurge a little. And Irene never pushed her to spend above her means; if Irene really wanted Molly to have something expensive it was bought as a gift, and never bought with the intention of being owed, though Molly would usually find some way of paying Irene back, either in the kitchen or in the boudoir. She really didn’t have a preference to how Molly paid her back, which said something to her skills as a cook and a lover.She enjoyed the opportunity to take Molly out to shop, not just because it was nice to have the company but because she liked admiring her girlfriend, her lover, in all sorts of outfits that she might wear. She liked seeing Molly in all sorts of things that gave her ideas of places to go, of dates they could have. But most importantly, she liked being out in public with Molly, showing the world that Margaret Jacqueline Hooper was her partner and that she adored her and if anyone thought otherwise they were quite wrong.AAADoughnuts With SprinklesASherlock/Doctor WhoAASherlock Holmes/Amy PondAAAAmy was particular about her favorite type of doughnuts. She had always enjoyed the ones with sprinkles, but she had a favorite type. They had to be the multicolour ones. Not the single colour ones, not the chocolate ones. They had to be the colourful ones, because those were the fun ones. That was the way her Aunt Sharon had always described them when she was a little girl.AASherlock never questioned it, and when she was sad or needed a pick-me-up, without fail, he’d scour London for a doughnut with multicoloured sprinkles. Even if the bakeries weren’t making them fresh he’d get one. And she didn’t mind if they were a bit stale; a doughnut was still a doughnut even if it was a bit on the older side.She’d always tear the doughnut in half and offer him some, and give him a grin before she licked all the sprinkles off her half, letting her tongue savor the sweetness of the glaze on the doughnut and the frosting on top. And she’d notice, without a doubt, that Sherlock would always watch, an amused grin on her face, as she sank her teeth into the other half and finally took a bite.AAAA Hypothetical ScenarioASherlockAAIrene Adler/AntheaAAA“If I were to be locked away in prison, would you engineer my release?” Irene asked, running her fingers along Andrea’s bare arm as they lounged together in the bed, tangled in the sheets. There wasn’t any need to have this conversation; she’d stayed far away from doing anything illegal that she could recall this week and so far her lover should have no worries as to having to implicate herself in any jailbreak proceedings.AA“Mmm, I suppose I could send in a team of mercenaries to break you out of prison,” Andrea said, stretching slightly and then shifting to press a kiss to Irene’s shoulder as she pulled the sheet aside to expose her bare skin. “But it would be much more effective if I simply walked inside with release papers signed by someone higher up on the food chain.” She moved her lips towards Irene’s collarbone. “Like, the Queen’s undersecretary.” Then she moved higher, to her pulse point. “Or perhaps Her Majesty herself.”Irene grinned at that and reached for Andrea, pulling her in for a thorough kiss upon the lips. She was fully confident Andrea would do just that, too. The woman loved her, had loved her for years, and if Irene wanted to be quite honest with herself, she loved her in return. She trusted her, adored her, for more than just her body. Andrea had managed to capture her soul and her heart and she kept them close and wouldn’t let anyone harm them, and that was why she loved her so.AAAFlirting Through Floral ArrangmentsASherlockAAGreg Lestrade/Molly HooperAAAAfter crying over Sherlock so many nights, after crying over Jim and the fiasco that that was and being used by him, after all of the headache and heartbreak and all that that her engagement had amounted to, Molly realized she had no tears left when it came to men. She had nothing, no ounce of deep sadness left in her body to weep over a failed relationship. She’d had a man she’d thought she could be serious cheat on her with a blonde haired bimbette in his office and she couldn’t shed a single tear. She just…didn’t care anymore.AAAnd it was a few days later a bouquet of red roses and calla lilies arrived in her office. There was a card attached that read “To make you smile,” and they did. For days, until they began to wither. And when that happened there was a bouquet of gardenias and yellow tulips, and then later a dozen orange roses and after that a gorgeous arrangement of daffodils. She didn’t know who was sending them because the cards were all unsigned, but finally Sherlock said someone was sending her a message. It wasn’t until after she got a bouquet of pink camellias (which she discovered meant “longing for you” in the language of the flowers and were flowers florists generally don’t keep on hand) that she’d spotted Greg at the florist near Barts who’d been delivering the flowers when she went to get some flowers for a friend who’d had surgery with a book in his hand on Victorian flower languages. She made it a point not to be seen, waiting for him to leave, and then went inside and placed two orders: a bouquet of yellow tulips to her friend and a white violets (meaning “let’s take a chance on happiness”) to Gregory Lestrade at New Scotland Yard with the card “I hope you get the message. Call me. Molly.” And when he called a few hours later, surprised but pleased, she knew he understood her message very well.",The Value Of A Moment,2221

He was just glad that his hours of paralysis and claustrophobia were over.The face that greeted his when the coffin lid finally lifted was a surprise, though.He'd known that Gibbs and his team finding him was almost too much to hope for, but instead of one of the gun-runner's movie-typical goons, or the older but admittedly still distinguished Rene Benoit, himself, the first face that he saw was astonishingly plain. On the small side, dressed in a plain charcoal suit that might have been off a Walmart rack, the man could have been an accountant if he weren't standing side by side with an arms merchant - the said merchant's hand on his shoulder. His hair was dark black or brown (it was a little hard for Tony to tell, as his eyes were watering from the sudden influx of light) and cut in a short, slightly spiky, high arched 'school boy' cut that Tony usually attributed to ""mama's boys"" and computer/gaming geeks who still lived with their parents. The man's pale skin tone suggested the leaned a little more towards the latter. “Ooooh, he's pretty.” The man cooed, clapping his hands in a slightly childish manner that set Tony's nerves slightly on edge especially followed by the man's next statement. “Are you sure he knows how to kill?”“He is a federal agent.” Rene Benoit supplied with thin smile that frightened Tony. “... And a former police officer.”Of course, he knew the man had realized he was an agent. He wouldn't have been kidnapped, drugged, bundled into a coffin, and shipped somewhere if the Benoit hadn't 'made' him, but the man's lack of anger was unusual and more frightening for it's absence. Usually, perps were really angry – murderously angry - when they found there inner circle's infiltrated, and Tony had gotten close to him through family. That usually meant even worse fates for agents and officers who got caught. “Yes, but can he kill?” “Yes, five confirmed from his NCIS records. Three earlier.” Benoit answered still studying Tony with a calculating look, and Tony can't help but wonder whether the paralytic agent they used on him had worn off enough for the man to see Tony's horror at the thought that there had to have been more than just a suspicion on Benoit's part that had turned him on Tony. It had been possible that Benoit could have just gotten wind of an investigation and Tony's recent incursion into his daughter's romantic life had put the man on alert, but that wouldn't have given the man his records. There had to be a leak in NCIS: A leak that could be just as easily turned on his boss or any of the other agents who tried to find him. “Ooooh, he's perfect. You always know what I like.” The other man's strange giddiness was striking Tony's nerves like steel hammers, denting his confidence that Gibbs would find him soon, or more to the point that there would even be something left for Gibbs to find.“Well, you did say that you were interested in having someone that you could experiment on.” Benoit's eyes locked with Tony's as he answered, and if he could have, he would have shuddered. As it was Tony's breathing started to pick up, straining against his mostly inert ribs. AHuman experimentation?!? Not Good. Very, Very not good! A“Now, now.” The man laughed as he reached out to pat Tony's abdomen just above where they had crossed Tony's hands in the traditional pose of the dead. “You're scaring him.”  He chastised lightly beginning to stroke lightly up and down Tony's abdomen in a manner that, truth be told, frightened Tony far worse than Benoit's suggestion. “I'm far more interested in a pet than an experiment; after all, Sherlock has his little mut tropping around at his heels, yapping on command. Why can't I?”“Your rivalry with that gentlemen is going to lead you into trouble, James.” Benoit sighed shaking his head, as he seemed to argue for the experimentation.Tony wasn't certain which was the safer option for him; though he decided to keep his ears out for the name 'Sherlock'. Any information on someone who could cause one or both of them trouble was information he could use. “Fine, fine.” The man, James, capitulated, though his hands didn't stop roving over Tony's torso in a disturbingly familiar manner.“A compromise then..."" The man answered, then giggled.AHe actually giggled. Who does that? Tony questioned silently, growing more and more certain of the man's instability.A""In the 1930's, Robert Thorndike ran some rather interesting experiments with 'wistar' browns using mazes, problem-solving tasks, and simple avoidance conditioning... that I have always wanted to replicate within my own set of conditions. Then, if he proves intelligent enough, I'll keep my little lab rat. If he doesn't, there are always drug trials and other amusing experiments we can try.” Benoit shook his head, and turned, seeming to savor one last look at Tony before he clapped his hand against the man's shoulders. “Have you're fun, James. As long as this settles the debts between us, I have no further interests in the man's fate. My information says that he did not wish the assignment, and my daughter claims that he did not use the opportunity to take advantage of her, so whatever punishment you choose will be satisfactory; I am certain.”“Yes, yes. You're writing in black ink, again.” James answered. “Then, I shall leave you to your fun.” Rene Benoit commented as he walked away. “Goodbye, Rene.” James answered warmly, still staring at Tony. If Benoit had seen the expression that Tony saw on James's face as arms merchant turned, he was certain the man would never have turned his back on the man without at least a helmet, bulletproof armor, and armed guards. Tony knew – even before James lifted his gaze briefly to a second floor, rafter, or window that Tony couldn't see – that La Grenouille was not leaving the building, alive. James's eyes didn't even flicker when the rifle shot - that Tony had known was coming – rang out. “There, there, Wistar, no one else will scare you.” He paused as if musing briefly, then continued, “without my permission, that is, and even that shouldn't be too necessary, if you do as you're told. Now, while we still have the advantage of the succynicholine that Rene so kindly gave you to ease the trauma of your overseas 'flight' in a cargohold... let's establish some baselines.”Tony's mind stuttered to a halt as the man's fingers slid to his belt and slowly began to pull the tongue of leather back through the buckle...",Trading Markers,24860

Instead of the elation they had expected, however, the Director had immediately questioned the discovery, seeming to try to poke as many holes in the possibility that Tony had survived as she could until she talked herself into disputing it outright and refusing to revoke her decision that Tony had been killed in the line of duty. When they continued to protest, Shepard had gone so far as to call security to lock down the morgue – refusing even Ducky and Palmer entrance until an 'unbiased' coroner could be brought in to finish the examination. Then things had really gotten ugly. Gibbs had been almost silent up to that point, letting the team present their own arguments, but the Director had kept trying to drag him into the discussion with snide remarks and claims that he'd failed 'another' of his agents, and wasn't willing to accept that Tony hadn't been able to come to him for support if he'd worried about being discovered. Some of the other accusations that she'd made against Gibbs had been even more bizarre and -way, way out of line. That had been when Gibbs had ordered them out and the shouting started. Fifteen minutes later, Gibbs stormed out of the office slamming the door so hard that the office window out to the hallway cracked in response. Watching the boss speed down the steps, Tim felt his gut drop as he remembered the last time he had seen this happen, and he knew what was coming next. His dread was proven in the next second when he felt Abby gasp as she saw that Gibbs' badge and wallet were in his hand as he turned on the second set of steps. “No!” Abby wailed almost in his ear as Gibbs stalked toward them, “Not again. Not when Tony needs you!”“Abs,” Gibbs cut her off, holding his arm out in invitation as he reached them. “I don't want to do it this way, but MADAM director isn't leaving me, any choice. She won't let us investigate his disappearance, and there's no way in hell, I'm gonna leave it alone.”Gibbs face when he turned turned back to Tim was apologetic, and Tim suspected that he knew what the man was going to say. Leaving Tony in charge the year before had been one thing, but Tim had seen enough to know that leaving him in charge would have been a completely different matter. He might have the computer skills and the general field experience, but he didn't have Tony's investigative background much less a good grasp of the paperwork and details that Tony had handled on a regular  basis – playing the role of team lead and second while Gibbs had been in Mexico – to ensure that the Director didn't have a reason to fill Gibbs' spot prematurely. “You don't need to say it, Boss. I'll hold those until you and Tony get back. I know that I can't be team lead. With two down, we wouldn't be a complete team anyway.”“That is three do-wn, Tim.” Ziva interrupted apologetically. “I do not believe that my position 'on the team' would be secure if Tony and Agent Gibbs are not present.”Tim wanted to dispute that, but they all knew the chances were to high that the Director would reassign the mossad agent to one of her 'special operations' just as she had tried to do with Tony.”“Your plans?” Gibbs questioned softly.“I believe that my country has a vested interest in further investigations of an arms dealer whom has had frequent interchanges with our enemies. If perhaps it were discovered that he was instrumental in the abduction of federal agents, our nations' interests might both be served.”For someone who has such an on and off grasp of the language, she can do subtle pretty well. Tim thought with a sad grim smile as he agreed with her comment. “I have some lea-” he began to offer, but Gibbs interrupted quickly, “Don't even think about it, any of you.” He turned his glare on the others, before he continued, “We need you here... with your jobs... clearance, and access in tact. I may need to ask you to run leads, and you can't do that if you're not in place.”“Got'cha.” Abby piped up answering for them all. Tim wasn't surprised, though he may have been a bit disappointed when Gibbs turned to Ducky and handed the wallet and gun to his friend, ordering, “Keep an eye out for them. I'll call when I know something.”Without another word, he hugged Abby tightly, nodded for Ziva to proceed him, and walked to the elevator. By some strange chance, just as Gibbs and Ziva reached the elevator doors, they slid open. Inside the elevator, a man in a shaved head and black bespoke suit stepped back for them to enter and studied the scene, his eyes catching on the gun and badge in Ducky's hands. As the door closed, Tim wasn't certain, but he thought he heard the man say, “You're just the man I was looking for.”Turning back to what was left of his team, Tim looked to Ducky for Abby for a clue as to what he should do next. Thankfully, the doctor sensed his question before it was asked and replied, “I do believe, Timothy, that you should join Abby and myself for dinner. Our good director has relieved us of duty until the evidence has been collected and relocated, and one can not expect you to be on call for a case solely on your own. I would suggest emailing this fact to Cynthia and letting her know of your absence for the evening. Even the good Director could not - formally- fault you for taking the evening off after the declaration of a teammate's death.”Tim almost started to disagree, but the doctor reasoned, “We will need to be fresh and able to respond should Jethro need us.” Abby's tightly returned hug made him concede where nothing else would have.",Trading Markers,24860

He'd earned a twenty-eight minute 'break' that morning by managing to cope with the man's hands groping him, just exactly that long, until he shuddered with revulsion. The man had continued his 'petting', despite Tony's abundant evidence of disinterest, and had given a brief hope that he hadn't noticed the slip, but as soon as he'd tired of his continued failure to rouse Tony's interest, James had glibly announced to Tony's watchers that he'd earned twenty-eight minutes respite between each test. The bastard was sicker than he'd even had the ability to imagine that first awful day, but Tony quickly put his resentful thoughts aside. There was only one reason that he even put with the James's unwanted attention – for those few minutes of peace it awarded him to ground himself firmly in the memory of who he was and who might be waiting at back at home for him. Outside of his 'earned respite', the sicko was forcing him to answer to a pet name 'Wistar' after some damn species of laboratory rat used in his favorite experiments. AAnd really, what kind of nut keeps track of the type of rat used in lab experiments?AWell, James did seem to be special breed of nut: one with a fixation on making Tony 'respond' to him willingly and  an obsession to compete with some other freak who was apparently keeping his own human 'pet.' ... And apparently the man had decide that his chosen 'pet' was to perform like a lab rat, based on the fact that James had actually built a to-scale human-sized rat's maze complete with a running wheel and food shoots that Tony had to press levers in the right order to activate. Based on the complexity of the room and it's ready availability, Tony suspected that it had been just waiting for an opportunity to be put to use. At least, he thought he was the first to use it, based on the lack lived-in-cell block stench that would have been left behind had someone else been kept in similar conditions. Especially as James' sick humor wasn't quite satisfied with the normal -if humiliating – lab rat challenges and had to add a few 'conditions' of his own - in the form of four snipers posted on the second floor who took pot shots at Tony as he ran the maze. Their rounds alternated between stinging rubber bullets and live rounds, as Tony had discovered on - tripping on the wheel at one point and finding a rather ugly hole shot between his fourth and fifth toes. He hadn't been given much opportunity to look around between 'runs', but he was sure he would have noticed bloodstains.James hadn't let him out of his maze to take care of the wound, either, claiming that it would interfere with the integrity of the experiment, but later that evening, he came in. After Tony had eaten the only food he'd been provided – a drugged block of cheese – (And seriously, a block of cheese?)... James had 'taken care' of Tony, ruthlessly pouring alcohol into the open wound then taping it up and turning his unwanted attentions on other parts of Tony's paralyzed body. The next day was the first time that James offered him the chance to earn down time between runs through the obstacle course...if Tony would only lie still under his attentions without the aid of the paralytic agents. It seemed to be a point of pride for the man to ensure that Tony respond as enthusiastically and willingly as 'Sherlock's pet', but James had assured him that he could be patient as long as long as Tony complied with his other whims, like answering to the name “Wistar”.Tony had been revolted almost to the point of vomiting what little food he'd eaten, but knew that even without the injured foot, he was at a severe disadvantage against the snipers, slowed by lack of sleep, insufficient food, and limited shelter between obstacles. Without the added time, he had no doubt that he'd quickly drop to one of the live rounds. Silently apologizing to Jethro for letting anyone else but his lover touch him, Tony had conceded, with the hope of surviving long enough for Jethro to find him. Please hurry, Jet, he silently begged.  I don't know how long I can keep going.“Ohhhh Tony, time to get up.” James' voice carried to the coffin, pulling a groan from Tony. It didn't feel like it had been nearly long enough, but he knew antagonizing the bastard wasn't going to help him survive. With that thought in his mind, he grudgingly pulled himself out of the coffin and wobbled a second before trying to catching himself. “Tsk, tsk, tsk, Wistar, and you were doing so well. I had almost believed that you'd broken yourself of that pesky that little habit.”“What?!? What did I do?” Tony demanded, wincing at the depth of desperation in his tone. “Why, you answered to that name, again, and I was hoping this wouldn't be necessary, but needs must, I suppose, if we are going to get you to accept your real name... Boys, Wistar seems a bit unsteady on his feet; do help him over to the tv table; there is something that I would like him to see.”All four of James's men came forward to pull and push Tony over a glass topped table. Beneath the glass top, a flat screen tv, about 48 inches by 48 inches wide, had been mounted facing upwards, at mid-thigh level, with a cd drive facing James, who stood across the table from him. “You're a movie-buff, I understand?” James asked spinning the disc on his finger as he watched Tony nod. “What about historical pieces?”“Never cared much for them, myself,” Tony answered, trying to hide his nerves in flippancy.“No? Well, that is a disappointment. There is so much to be gained from watching historical drama. Take this one for instance,” he continued, lifting the disc so that Tony could see the rainbow-like shine of it's recorded tracks. “I think this drama will definitely hold your attention and may even clear up a serious misconception on your part.”  “Before we can start, though, there is the matter of proper form to be seen to. Gentlemen, if you will?”Before he could defend himself, Tony was grabbed by two of the men, and pushed over the table. They dragged him down, forcing his cuffs down and around the edges of the table the table until they caught on hooks embedded into the sides. As his wrists were locked in place, the other two men grabbed his legs - pulling his hips away until he was forced to lean at almost a ninety degree angle parallel over the table. They forced his feet apart at least as wide as the table legs, if not wider and secured them in place by a metal bar with slots at each end that slipped down and locked into the buckles of his ankle cuffs.  Barely a moment later, they forced his knees almost farther apart than he'd known they could go, making him crouch uncomfortably to take the pressure off the his knees from bar that pushed cruelly at their side instead of putting pressure to the back of his knees where he could have bent them without forcing his hips to almost pop their joints as they were pushed outward.  As soon as Tony was finally immobilized, James pushed the cd in and sauntered around the edge of the table, trailing his fingers up Tony's nearest arm as he walked. “No now,” James instructed, pushing Tony's chin back down when he tried to follow the man's progress around the table and behind him, “This is important, a one time lesson, if you will. Hopefully, you'll  pay attention, and this will sink in before we need to resort to more drastic measures.”Almost on cue, the screen came to life, panning across a field of marble crosses that Tony quickly recognized as Arlington National Cemetery. In the near distance, with their backs to the camera, stood a gathering wrapped in a semi-circle around an open grave. Standing across from the gathered mourners, dressed in black with a mesh veil pinned artfully back, Director Jennifer Shepard moved behind the portable podium that had been set up beside the graveside. “We gather here, today, to bid our farewell to Agent Anthony DiNozzo, Junior. As many of you may be aware, Tony did not stand on ceremony and requested in his testamentary documents that we not waste money on “maudlin words muttered over a mound of earth.” Instead, he has asked that we join together,  after this at Clancy's and lift a glass in his memory. To that end, unless anyone would like to say a few words, we can ...”“I do, Miss...” a familiar voice interrupted, and Tony nearly choked in astonishment as his father joined the Director at the podium. “Junior was always...” His father began, but Tony missed what followed when his hips were pulled back against James's as the man pushed into him and bottomed out in a single shredding thrust. Tony's face fell hard against the glass as he collapsed under the painful assault, gasping between choking sobs that were beyond his control to contain. Without pausing for Tony's body to accommodate the intrusion, James pushed his Tony's hips back into the table, dragged himself completely  out and causing Tony to cry out in pain again as it felt like his insides were being pulled out of his body. James grabbed Tony by his hair, and pulled his head back up to watch, pushing in and bottoming out again on the return stroke, as he ordered, “Pay attention, now Wistar.” As the man set up a torturous rhythm, Tony eagerly tried to divorce himself from what was happening to his body and submerged himself in the sight of them lowering 'Tony DiNozzo's' coffin into the ground. He scanned the crowd, hoping not to pick out the familiar profiles of his team, hoping that they weren't there, that they hadn't bought his death and were even then out searching for him, but there were too many people. It looked as if close to the whole office had joined the gathering, and with his team likely to be at the front of the pack, he couldn't be sure whether they were there until the mourners started to thin into a single-file line to lay white roses on his coffin before they lowered it. Near the head of the line, just behind his father, huddled together for sympathy, Abby and Tim slowly approached the coffin, closely followed by Ducky. Crying out with a pain almost equal to what his body was suffering, Tony dropped his head shutting his eyes, despite James's insistent shake. It didn't matter what the man did to him; if he had to watch Jethro lay a flower on his coffin, it would be the end of him.“Naughty, naughty.” James rebuked Tony, dragging his head back up and riding Tony brutally as he forced him to watch until the coffin was lowered into the ground and covered, punctuating each word with a thrust as he warned, “Now, you'll just have to punished.”The thought seemed to excite James so much that he finished within seconds, pulled out without further comment, and let Tony's head drop to the glass. The sound of a zipper being pulled back up cut across the sound of Tony's agonized sobs, just in time for him to hear the slap of something into the man's hand. Tony froze anxiously, thinking that he'd heard the sound before, and whimpered when he was proven right as he felt a nudge of thick rubber against his abused anus. Before he could catch his breath, to force his muscles to relax, James's hand cupped around the back of the overlarge rubber bulb and pushed it home, grinding his palm against Tony's crack when it couldn't go any deeper. The man actually cooed through his scream, working the bulb against Tony's prostate until Tony's cry broke on a high pitched note. “That's it, Pet, mew for daddy.” James cooed again as he gestured to the men to unhook Tony. Tony staggered as they pulled him upright and hooked his wrist cuffs to a chain that they had pulled into place on a roller track over head. “Gentlemen, at your convenience,” James offered, giving Tony a spin before stepping back, out of the way, as his men raised paintball rifles and – at close range – hammered Tony with rupturing paint balls that stole his breath with every hit until he was covered from head to toe in paint and James finally cleared his throat, calling their shooting spree to a halt.“Such a pretty, pretty canvas you make, Pet. So bright and colorful, maybe we should do this more often.” Torn down by pain and misery, Tony shook his head as frantically as he could with the little strength he had left. “No? Then tell me something I want to hear: something you think will make me happy. Tell me what you learned.”The lesson was obvious. Tony had no doubt that he knew what the man wanted to hear, but after what he'd seen, it struck too close to home to say. “Come on, Pet. Don't make me do something drastic.” James's hand closed around Tony's throat as he repeated his demand, “Tell me what you learned.”“Tony DiNozzo's dead.” The words tumbled helplessly from Tony's lips, a half conscious plea for survival. “Good boy... And?!?”“Wistar...” the rest of the sentence stuck in Tony's throat, but James must have been able to read them in the tears of doubt and exhaustion that rolled down Tony's cheeks, for after a moment, the man's thumbs came up, wiping gently under his eyelashes and pleasure colored his cold gaze. “That's my good little lab rat. Take him down boys and put him to bed. He's earned a small respite.”",Trading Markers,24860

Trent had expected it, of course, after bluntly announcing that he was responsible for the explosion that had destroyed Tony's car and prevented the formal investigation into his second in command's disappearance. He had hoped, however, that the task of driving would slow the agent's reflexes at least minutely, thankfully Trent's own weapon had been easily accessible and was already drawn and the muzzle aimed to a point directly between Gibbs eyes. “You've got funny way of asking for help.” Gibbs challenged. “Help?” Kort asked with a startled chuckle, wondering how sane the man he was staring at was; Gibbs did come with a pretty decent reputation of his own (for reckless behavior, a tendency to go 'off the reservation', and a hair-trigger temper), even in the circles Trent traveled.  “What makes you think I'm asking for help?” He questioned, curious about the man's logic. “Only three reasons you would have gotten my car and dropped a bomb like that.” A…AA…AA…ATrent let the time pass, knowing that Gibbs was baiting him, and fully knowing that the silence was supposed to make him uneasy. It was almost an amateur's trick, or almost so. Letting Gibbs continue to drive with barely a glance at the road every thirty seconds was another matter, though, and while Trent was knowingly stubborn and prideful, he was not suicidal.“Well?” he finally prompted, when it became obvious that Gibbs was all to content to barely glance at the road while keeping his attention on Trent. “You're either suicidal, homicidal, or...”“Getting in any car you're driving should count as suicidal,” Trent grumbled under his breath, but Gibbs ignored him, continuing, “you need my help.” “What makes you think it's not one of the first two?” Trent retorted, half acknowledging the point.“You pulled your gun, so it's not the first, but you haven't used it, so it's not the second.”“That doesn't mean that...”“People don't offer up confessions unless they want forgiveness or help. That gun says you know I'm not the forgiving type.” “Hrrgh... Fine.” Trent lowered his gun and stifling his frustration. Gibbs really was just as annoying as he'd heard. Without warning, Gibbs' arm jerked throwing the truck sideways, and though he'd tried to grab his door handle, Trent fell almost into his lap, just as Gibb's sig-sauer fell and with it darkness. A…AWhen Trent came back to consciousness, it was with to the annoying but unfortunately familiar feeling of his wrists cuffed behind his back. Gibbs had secured his ankles, too. Probably with zip ties, but with the way he'd secured Trent's hands to the car door, it was difficult for Trent to turn and check. A This had been a mistake.A“Talk.” Gibbs ordered, recognizing that Trent was awake again, without even looking. Thankfully, this time keeping his eyes on the road.“Not interested.” Trent retorted sullenly, stung by the fact that the lowly NCIS agent had gotten the jump on him. “Thought we'd decided you weren't suicidal.” Gibbs answered, in a not so subtle threat. “I'm in your car, aren't I? That suggests otherwise.” Although he realized that he wasn't likely to get the upper hand, Trent couldn't suppress his first instinct to balk at not having the upper hand. A…AA…AA…AGibbs let the silence drag on even longer the second time, and damn it, it was even more annoying than the first time. Trent hated having his hands tied behind his back, both literally and figuratively. He hated trying not to shift... trying not to let the other person know how much being tied bothered him... hated that Gibbs had so easily gotten the drop on him. “Why aren't you asking me any questions?” He pushed, trying to goad Gibbs into an angry response  and give him the upper hand. “Don't have to.” Gibbs simple (and too calm) reply was infuriating. Gibbs couldn't think that he'd just reveal everything he knew; even if Gibbs didn't realize that Trent was CIA, he had to know by now that he was at the very least a player in the game. “I'm not just going to tell you everything, you know that don't you?” He retorted, hoping that he could worry the agent with the possibility that he might not reveal DiNozzo's location. “Then why did you come to me?” Trent didn't have an answer, and he knew Gibbs knew it. They both knew how the game worked well enough to know that Trent's unsolicited confession of his involvement in DiNozzo's disappearance had been almost the equivalent of coming with his hat in hand for assistance. He'd compromised himself when he'd let Director Shepard target DiNozzo as the leak responsible his last team's failed mission – a mission that had left him in rather uncomfortable circumstances for longer than he liked and one of the few fellow agents that he'd actually come to trust buried half a row away from where they'd buried DiNozzo's unlucky stand-in. She'd corroborated her suspicions with verifiable security logs placing DiNozzo in the building after hours at the same time as the leak that had blown his operation occurred, and there was no  evidence giving any indication that she'd even disliked DiNozzo to any degree that would have been suspicious. He'd broken camp by running his own op on US soil, which might have been forgiven, if he'd been right; he'd unintentionally facilitated the kidnapping (and forced exportation) of a federal agent; and last but not least, focusing on his plans to take DiNozzo out, he hadn't been in place to track Benoit back to his connection with La Moriar. La Moriar, an as yet unidentified criminal mastermind, was believed to have a spiderweb of illegal networks and operations spanning the globe. The agency had been tracking Benoit and dozens of other arms merchants, assassins, mafioso, and smugglers with reputed ties back to the criminal, but Benoit had been the closest they had come yet to identifying him, and Trent had broken camp right at the exact time that Benoit had scheduled to meet with the elusive criminal. If Trent's latest intel was correct, Benoit, himself, had been exposed and taken out. There was not a single question in his mind whether his burn notice was on its way. His only hope was to out run it, and double the agency's expected return, but he couldn't do that alone. He couldn't trust the director, doing that had gotten him into this fix in the first place, and other than Gibbs and his team, no one else Trent knew had enough of a vested interest in the results that Trent needed to leverage their help. His only chance of recovery rested in giving Gibbs exactly what he wanted, and from the files he'd found on the Shepard' computer earlier that morning, Trent suspected that he knew what that was, or rather who that was. The fact that Gibbs had clearly been in the process of throwing his job away to pursue his own rogue operation when Trent was on the way to arrange a one on one with the man – only confirmed his suspicions. “What if I say I can help you get DiNozzo back?”“Considering you're the reason he's gone, you're gonna have to say more than that.”“What would you say if I told you that Director Shepard is the one who put me on his trail and told me that he was the one who betrayed my team on our last operation?” “Two things: prove it and bullshit.”“What?!?”“Rule 3 – Don't believe what you're told. Double check.”“Is that in reference to the Director, or DiNozzo?”“Yep.”“I can back it up. Been in the game too long not to cover my ass. Everything's recorded on a jump drive hidden in ...” “Your spare magazine. Got it.”“Shit. You're thorough.” “Rule 16.” “Your rules, Gibbs, haven't made agency canon, yet. If you intend for that to be understood, a translation would be useful.”“If someone thinks they have the upper-hand...”“Take it away,” Trent continued, agreeing in principle, despite the inconvenience it caused him.“Break it!” “I see.” Trent acknowledged the barely veiled threat. “Doubt it, but we'll find out.”“Whether you elect to believe me or otherwise, the fact still remains that I can get you what you want.”“You think you know what I want?”“I am certain of it. You want DiNozzo back, and that means you want Benoit's last contact, an English man by the name of Richard Brook. He's acts as a go between for another player La Moriar. He's supposed to be the last one to see Benoit alive.”“Benoit's dead?” “It's unconfirmed, but from a reliable source...”“A 'reliable source' says Tony's dead, too; I don't think much of your reliable sources. If Benoit's dead...”“Benoit's dead!” Trent insisted, but Gibbs continued as if he hadn't spoken:“If he's dead, what does that mean for Tony? Been more than 48.” “I know, but there's a good chance that Benoit kept him alive... to pay a marker he owed La Moriar.”“Details.” Gibbs ordered, but Trent had little difficulty hearing the tightness in his throat and the suppressed emotion. “There have been rumors that La Moriar... has … interesting tastes...” This was the tricky part that Trent had been hoping to avoid. If anything was guaranteed to drive the reportedly temperamental man into a rage, it would have to be hearing that his 'partner' had been abducted to be sold as a sexual slave to a reputedly violent and unstable criminal. “Don't make me drag it out of you.” “The rumors say...” Trent continued, trying to distance himself from the message, “that he's been looking for someone to break... and to use, but that so far... at least up to the point that Benoit grabbed DiNozzo, none of his previous subjects have survived very long.”“This Brook will know where he is?” “If anyone does.” Trent agreed as neutrally as possible. He couldn't guarantee that Brooks would have DiNozzo, but the cargo manifest for the British airliner had listed the coffin as carrying an Alfred Brooks, from London. “Okay.” Gibbs finally answered pensively. Deciding that he had probably pushed his argument as far as he should, Trent settled back into the seat, as comfortably as he could - willing to wait until after they pulled into Gibbs' driveway to be released.",Trading Markers,24860

He knew the heaviness of his silence had been a red flag drawing her attention to the screen, but there was no way he was going to let her see what he was looking at; no one should have ever seen them. No one but he and Tony, and not really even then because neither one of them had given permission for the photos to be taken. Dozens of photos of himself and Tony, caught in private, intimate moments scrolled across the screen, silently narrating the past six months of their slowly developing relationship: AATony leaning against the windowsill in the kitchen, a beer in hand, exhaustion clear in Tony's eyes, AAThe top of his own head barely visible hiding obscuring Tony's ears as he kissed Tony's neck; AATony dressed in ratty shorts (he'd borrowed, of course) washing varnish off his legs- the first time he'd truly put all of his effort into trying to help with the boat (it had been a disaster);AATony's back obscuring Gibbs, his arm wrapped around Gibbs' waist, as they watched steaks browning on the grill;AATony laying in the hammock, beckoning for Gibbs to join him;AAHimself leaning over Tony, kissing away a smear of whip cream from the ridiculously sweet ambrosia dessert that Tony had thrown together, then thrown out when neither of them had the stomach to eat more than a few tablespoons of the overly sweetened coconut, cream, and fruit salad.AAA Each photo was an uninvited invasion into their private lives and an utter and unforgivable betrayal of their trust. In time, they might have shared such intimate moments with Abby, and maybe Ducky, but if everyone thought that he closely guarded his privacy- it was nothing compared to how closely Tony guarded his. Even as close as they'd become, there were subjects that Gibbs knew he couldn't touch, including any thing related to Tony's mother, the truth behind his father abandoning him in Hawaii, why Tony continued to tell such outlandish and over-exaggerated tales of supposed dating conquests when Gibbs knew without question that Tony had been faithful to him since they first started 'seeing each other'. Gibbs had his suspicions of course, but barring the use of heavy doses of sodium pentathol,  he didn't think that he'd ever get to the truth of the skeletons rattling around in Tony's closet. 'In time' would have probably been five to ten years down the road, if how their previous six years had progressed was any guide. And Gibbs was okay with that. As much as he loved Abby like a daughter, cared for Ducky like an uncle or even a much older brother, and included Tim, Ziva, and Jimmy in his 'chosen' family as nephews and a niece, or maybe second cousins... Jenny wasn't even on list. Yes, she was an old lover, and she could have been on the list - if things were different- if she weren't always so ready to put someone else between herself and a bullet (literal or not). She could have been his partner, his spouse, the unofficial mother of their close knit group, but family doesn't use family for their own ends – not in Gibbs family at least. And that was what made the irony of her betrayal all the more bitter. “You found these on her computer?” he asked for Kort's confirmation, as unnecessary as it was. He didn't need the man's statement of where he'd found them, or Kort's interpretation of what they'd meant. “Yes, those; digital copies of your cellphone records – cross-referenced to each other's numbers; faxed copies of your credit card balance statements...” “I get the picture.” He snapped cutting Kort off, “They're all on here?”“Yes.”“Okay, move over with Ziva; bring her up to speed.”“What about...” Kort's eyes swept the laptop with a quick flash. “On a need to know basis,” Gibbs growled softly, “and I decide who needs to know.”Kort was thankfully silent after that, moving over to both distract Ziva from her none-to-subtle attempts to catch a glimpse of the screen and to lay out what Kort knew about the men who were probably holding Tony. Turning his gaze back to the photos scrolling across the screen, Gibbs clutched the laptop to keep his hands from shaking with rage... and to keep himself from deleting the unauthorized photos out of hand.  His first instinct was to delete the tainted photos, but he knew that he couldn't erase Shepard's betrayal just by erasing the evidence of months long surveillance. If he did, Tony would always wonder about them, trying to imagine how much they might have shown, how she tried to make them look, the way she composed the shots. No, it was better to let him see the photos and set his mind at rest about what they contained... to let him see the obsession and jealousy painted across each picture as clear as a dusted finger print. The bitter irony of her betrayal and the very reason of her jealousy was that Tony had filled the role that Jenny couldn't: Tony had taken naturally to the role of helpmate and confidant; caring for their family when he could not; caring for him when he was at the end of his ropes; buffering the team from his moods; lifting their spirits in their darkest hours; filling in the blanks when they or Gibbs fell short; and somehow staying true to himself and to them throughout. Tony was what Shepard could never be – the heart and soul of their family. The Director thought she knew what he was like at his worst, but if that heart was stilled … that soul was extinguished...  Shepard would never live to see his worst – outside of the flash of his rifle-barrel in the distance. That he would want her to see... would want her to know it was coming and to know that there was nothing she would be able to do to prevent it. That thought was the other reason that he couldn't delete the photos: if Tony died or if he was already dead, Gibbs would need those photos as tangible reminders to both Shepard's betrayal and Tony's memory. He'd forgotten Tony, once, and had no intention of letting it happen again. The memento box, a gift from his mother when he was nine, that he had been keeping since third grade now held, in addition to the first bullet he'd dug out of a tree when he was thirteen and realized that he was a ' rea-l-ly good shot, his slowly collected rules, photos of Shannon, Kelly and Maddie, a cassette tape of Kelly's first piano recital, a beer napkin scribbled with a blotchy 'good job' – the first hard-won acknowledgment Franks had ever given him, a folded lace handkerchief that his maternal grandmother used to keep tucked into the straw hat she wore for gardening, his dog tags, and other collected mementos, now held Tim's recording of Tony's stream of conscious rambled response to pain medication burned on a mini cd, a key chain with a small metal St. Bernard, and the bent bottle cap from the cervesa that Tony had sipping on as he stood in the Mike Frank's open doorway, waiting to  explain why he'd come down to Mexico knowing that Gibbs barely remembered him and had intentionally left NCIS behind to escape the memories he couldn't access. ~ ~ Tony, standing in the doorway with a beer hanging loosely from his fingertips and another sitting on the open windowsill beside him, had been an unwelcome sight for the still struggling Gibbs. Gibbs had left Mike Frank's hut that morning to comb the beach for more driftwood to work into a rustic rocking chair that he hoped to sell at the local market. He'd still had some of the money left from his 'go – bag' and if he had absolutely needed to he had known that he could pull more from his US accounts, but the nearest bank had been close to a day and a half ride's distance from Mike's place... and even with his spotty memory, he'd realized that his team would be keeping an eye out for his location and would be watching his bank records for sure. He hadn't been ready to deal with them yet, and sure as hell hadn't been ready for Tony to be standing on Frank's porch. ~~“What the hell are you doing here?” He'd snarled, throwing the driftwood branches in a pile near the porches edge. ~~ Gibbs thought Tony might have winced at his tone, but it had been a small wince if he had, and Tony had hidden it well in a shrug as he handed Gibbs the remaining cervesa and picked up one of the folded pieces of sandpaper that Gibbs had left on the porch, held down by one of Frank's cigarette trays (an emptied out cervesa bottle filled with ash and cigarette butts). ~~ Tony had walked past him, as he was opening the bottle, to the driftwood pile and quickly sorted out one of the nicer pieces Gibbs had picked up. Returning to the porch steps, he sat down and nonchalantly began sanding the tip of the branch, waiting for Gibbs to do the same before he finally spoke. ~~ “Don't intend to let you go breaking your own rules, even if you don't remember them.”  Tony had supplied, and despite himself, Gibbs had been hooked in by the comment. ~~ “How's That?”~~ “Number 15...” Tony had offered giving him a brief moment to fill the rule in, before supplying, “Always work as a team.”~~ Before Gibbs had the chance to respond, Tony had followed up with, “Rule  Forty-one... when you have to leave a man behind to get the job done, the job's not over till you bring him home.”~~ “Not ready to go back, an no guarantee that I will be.” Gibbs retorted sharply. ~~ “Some jobs take longer than others.”  Tony replied stubbornly, “Don't remember what rule that was, but it should have been if it wasn't covered.”~~ “Rule 42,” Gibbs answered reluctantly, not sure how to handle Tony's too calm approach. It would have been a hell of a lot easier if Tony had taken offense and yelled at him for abandoning the team instead of the inexplicably calm acceptance of Gibbs refusal to return to DC. ~~ Tony hadn't been finished yet, though. ~~ “Rule 8, never take anything for granted,” he continued, “Always verify.... Franks can probably answer most of your questions up to 9-11, after that....” he paused pulling out a 'little black book' from his jacket pocket that he set by Gibbs hip on the porch, “That should help... Anything that doesn't answer...”~~ Lifting his gaze from the black book, back to Tony's hands, Gibbs was a bit startled to see a complicated looking satellite cellphone kit in the agent's outstretched palm. ~~ “Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it looks. The base is an “add-on” from Abby and McGee; in addition to a 'nifty' deep infiltration battery pack, they have added a handy-dandy channel router and encrypter that will make the signal virtually untraceable for any calls under three minutes in length. Over three minutes – they and only about three other supergeeks in the nation could trace it if they know in advance which channels to cut out in their search. They promised that it's not any more difficult than one of the field units you would have used during the Gulf War. ~~ “For anything the book doesn't answer, the rest of our team's on speed dial; just push a button, and you can ask your question directly: number 1's Ducky, 2's Abby, 3's Fornell, 4's myself, 5's McGee, 6's our lovely little Mossad, 7's Jimmy Palmer, I doubt there's anything you're really really going to need to call him for, but ... well anyway, 8's the director. I don't know what the deal between you two is, but you seem to have a history, and scrap a lot... and...” 			~~ “And...” Gibbs had pressed already guessing who the last entry was, and was ready to rail at the man for his presumption. ~~ “And, it looks like I'd better hurry if I want to catch my ride back.”~~ Following Tony's gaze, Gibbs had been startled to see the rickety bus returning returning two hours earlier than it normally returned from it's route. Tony had shrugged explaining that he had promised he would give the driver the equivalent of five hundred American – if he'd give them an hour, before picking him back up. ~~ “So let me get this straight, you just took a three day trip down here to drink a beer, give me your little black book, and phone – only to turn around and go back?” ~~ “Yep.” ~~“Why are you doing this?” Gibbs demanded. By Tony's unexpected arrival, Gibbs still hadn't been able to remember much more than he had before he left DC... enough to know that his gut told him to trust Tony, but not enough to know why. ~~ Tony's smile had turned enigmatic as he stared at Gibbs briefly, emptying the cervesa bottle before answering, “you don't waste good.”  ~~ Without another word, Tony had turned and trotted back up the hill, digging some bills out of his pocket and waving them at the driver.  In Tony's wake, Gibbs had grabbed the emptied cervesa bottle and cap, tucking the latter in his front pocket and the little black book in his back pocket and the satelite phone went under his bunk – despite Mike Frank's sneer.  After Tony had left, Gibbs had started carrying around the little black book and reading at his leisure, but the satellite phone remained untouched for another month and a half, until one of Tony's black book commentaries forced Gibbs to call. ~~ “What the hell do you mean that Abby doesn't entirely trust me?” Gibbs had demanded as soon Tony had answered with a yawn. ~~ “And hello to you, too, Boss. Okay, about that Abby trusts you with her life; we all do.”~~ “Then why...”~~ “We trust you with OUR lives, Gibbs. Not your own; you've got a real talent for jumping between oncoming threats and your team... especially if it calls for going off the reservation. Not the healthiest of habits, if you take my meaning, and about the only thing Abby doesn't trust you to do – is to keep yourself from getting hurt, or if you can't, at least to make sure that we're around to pull you out of it.”~~ “From what I've read, I'm not the only one.”  At the time, Gibbs hadn't been confident enough, yet, to tell Tony, that he was starting to remember the younger man and that, away from the perspective of their day to day work, he had been able to piece together both his feelings for the agent and what he'd begun to believe the agent felt for him. ~~ “Guilty as charged, but that's one of the benefits of having a Marine as a boss; what comes around goes around, and I've learned from the best never to leave a man behind. Night, Gibbs.” ~~ “Night, Tony.” Gibbs had answered, before glancing around at the darkened cabin. The next morning had found him packing up most everything that he'd taken down to Mexico and hiking back up the hill to start the first leg of a three day trip back to DC. Running his fingertips across the gallery of photos that the Director had somehow taken of himself and Tony, Gibbs closed his eyes and played the memory of that late night phone call back through his head. “Try to remember it, Tony,” He murmured in a barely voiced prayer, “I'll never leave you behind.”When he opened his eyes again, it was to another memory that had unexpectedly risen to the surface, a memory of another time, another place, and another man he had not been willing to leave behind.Pulling up the browser's search page, Gibbs typed in the captain's name and hit the search button. Three minutes later, he had an address, a phone number, and several interesting news excerpts, mentioning his friend.",Trading Markers,24860

He quickly typed a text to accompany the image: ATK,APackage still operative.ARetrieval Urgent.ASHAand quickly dispatched the update. It sickened Sherlock to leave the man to the mercies of Moriarity, but on the event of Sherlock's presumed death, Moriarity had pulled the four assassins, previously assigned to John, Mycroft, Lestrade Mrs. Hudson, back to the warehouse to 'train' his latest unwilling recruit, ensuring that, while his friends and family are moderately safe, Sherlock currently had no 'backup' and could not contact the yard without revealing his deception and dooming his friends. Without at least the extraction team's support, Sherlock couldn't risk revealing his presence in a hopeless rescue attempt, until he could ensure that this version of Moriarity was the correct version. Even having claimed that he could prove that the actor's role had solely been a false identity, Sherlock hadn't understood the depth of Moriarity's deception. Richard Brook hadn't been just a false identity; Moriarity's duplicity had been far deeper and far more complicated than even Sherlock had expected. Richard Brook had been a brainwashed actor with a superficial resemblance to Moriarity that had been 'enhanced' through judicious plastic surgery to provide Moriarity the ultimate alibi and scapegoat... and if Mycroft's liaison was correct, this wasn't the first such scapegoat that Moriarity had sacrificed. “Ohhhh, Wis-tar,” Moriarity sing-song voice caught Sherlock's attention, in time for Sherlock to see the American agent flinch in response. The American must have whispered some response, but it was too soft or too far away for Sherlock to hear. Digging out the 'kit' the liaison had given him, Sherlock slipped an ear-piece into his left ear and secured the amplifier to the window frame -aimed at a midpoint between where the American agent hung, and where Moriarity was sitting on the edge of a glass topped table, twirling what appeared to be a plastic facsimile of a Beretta between two fingers. “You've been doing soooo well on our little maze that I've decided you are ready for a few direct learning techniques. If you do very well on your lessons, I might decide to take you out of the maze entirely and keep you as my own personal pet. That would be nice wouldn't it.”“Yes, Sir.” The American answered, but Sherlock didn't believe for a second that his response was any more indication of the man's desire for Moriarity's company than it was rote answer to escape the sick torturous gauntlet that Sherlock had witnessed the man being forced to run on more than one occasion. “If you're a very, very good little pet, we might even take you on a walkie.” Despite being hung by his wrists; degraded by days of torture, near starvation, and cruel treatment; and visibly beyond exhaustion, the American roused to full attention under their gaze, and Sherlock was certain that it was in response to the possibility of earning a chance to escape. From Moriarity's smile, Sherlock was certain that the criminal was well aware of his captive's motivation, but Sherlock had to hope that the man would do what it took to earn the chance as it might be the only opportunity for Sherlock to help the man – before the American extraction team arrived.It would be a risk, for certain, possibly even endanger the entire operation by causing Moriarity, the real Moriarity, to go to ground, but the American's tenacity, quiet endurance, and shows of intelligence strongly reminded Sherlock of John... and there was no certainty, in Sherlock's mind, at least, that Moriarity's temperament favored waiting for the American team's arrival. Moriarity was fickle in the extreme and a moment's boredom could easily result in the agent's death.  “Are we pay-i-ng – atten-tttion?” Moriarity sing-songed again, dragging Sherlock's own attention back to the tableau. “Yes, Sir.” “Very good, Wistar. Let's begin then.”  Without further comment, the plastic beretta stopped spinning and swung out. A sharp pop corresponded with a swallowed cry from the American when a riot round struck the precise center of one of the many bruises left on the man's body from being subjected to endless vollies of the riot rounds as he ran the maze. Moriarity swung the beretta back and forth as if it wear a conductor's wand leading a silent symphony  whose only notes were the agent's sporadic gasps when Moriarity punctuated his gestures with another round. Having watched the sickening spectacle of the man being run through the maze on previous days, Sherlock was almost certain that Moriarity would be reaching a live round soon...…Waiting for Gibbs and the woman to pick up their luggage, Trent glanced down at his cellphone screen and smiled as he read the message. “What have you got for me?” Gibbs demanded, seeming to have somehow decided the message was pertinent to his concerns. Deciding that a show of trust might help him buy a little of the man's good will, he turned the phone to  face Gibbs and let the older man read the screen. “Who's SH?” “Who he is... is a bit complicated.” Trent sighed, realizing that he should have anticipated the question. “Uncomplicate it. Is he an informer, CIA, deep cover, what?” Gibbs demanded trying to gauge his sources credibility. “As I said, it's complicated.” Trent began, but decided finally – in for a half-pence, in for a pound and explained: “He is the younger brother of the man behind the scenes who runs MI-5, SAS, and a few other acronym bearing agencies within the British government.  He is independent of his brother's normal hierarchy, but has been known to work for the crown as... an independent contractor of sorts.”“Just great.” Gibbs growled, “Can he be bought?”“No, according to my information, he is independent from his brother precisely because he is unwilling to compromise his principles, such as they are.”“Such as they are?” Gibbs asked with a frown. “Well,  as I understand it, my source thinks nothing of breaking into a suspects apartment to get information, but would never stage or falsify information to frame an innocent party.” Kort replied trying to frame the character trait in as positive manner as possible. “Ok... hate working with wild cards, but...” Gibbs paused glancing back at the message, “How can we be sure that it's Tony he's talking about?”“He sent a picture.” Trent offered pointing to the button that would open the image. Hopefully SH had sent the image Trent had requested. “Tony ... charah be'leben,” Agent David cursed softly in distress as she looked across Gibbs arm at the phone's small screen. “We must find him.”“Get me a location!” Gibbs bit out, and shoved the phone back at Trent. “Gibbs, it is not as simple as that!” Trent protested, regretting for the thousandth time the need to bring the man into the operation. “Make it simple!” Gibbs ordered, but before Trent could say anything else, a dry weary laugh interrupted them from behind. “It's been close to ten years since I've heard it, but I would have thought you could learn a new phrase or two by now,” the man's voice continued, seeming to attempt a humor that wasn't quite supported by the his forced tone. Turning on his heels to identify their unexpected guest, Trent felt his mouth drop open in surprise as Gibbs announced over his shoulder, “Ziva, I'd like to introduce you to Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.” …Moriarity finally lowered the pistol, with a smile as he approached the American agent, who to Sherlock's shock was still alive, despite Moriarity running through close to four cartridges of rounds.“And what have we learned?” Moriarity questioned as the man panted to catch his breath between pained gasps. “That in addition to being beyond insane, your sadism is also illogical in it's application?” Holmes demanded in a whispered question, “how could he have learned the key from that? He wouldn't have even known what to look for.” AAAs it was, it had taken Sherlock three rounds to even recognize the pattern of shots, and he had already known of it's existence. He waited in dread for the American's answer, or Moriarity's response to a lack of one, but his head shot up in shock as the American replied, “A pattern. Not Morse... binary … hits on the bruises for 1, on clear spots for 0?”“Oh, Wistar, how clever you are.” Moriarity hoped off the table clapping excitedly. “Oh you've got to have a reward for that.” To Sherlock's disgust, Moriarity circled around behind the American and began to run his hands over the agent's body in a revoltingly familiar and loathesomely possessive manner that was made all the more disturbing by the agent's passive resignation to Moriarity's touch... showing that it wasn't the first time he had been touched that way. When Moriarity settled behind the American, a clearly painful grip on one hip, and the agent's pained gasps increased to cries of misery, Sherlock had to turn away, sliding down to his back against the rooftop as fought to ignore what was happening below him. “We don't know enough,” he hissed to himself. “Not yet, it has to be Moriarity! We have to be sure.” It was close to a full minute before he remembered to pull the ear piece out of his ear.",Trading Markers,24860

Turning back to her computer, Cynthia sent a quick sms/text message to Tim's phone, asking that someone from “IT” check for the cause of the error with the alarms. Afterward, feeling the Director's  eyes on her, she sent a quick alert not to pick up and began to dial, noticing the soft click on the line when the Director picked up the line to listen in. “You have reached the number of TK enterprises,” a cultured British voice began, and Cynthia slowly turned hearing the Director's phone settle softly in the cradle before she was facing the woman. Offering the woman a sympathetic shake of her head, she shrugged and returned her own phone to its cradle. 'Thank you' the director mouthed through window, and Cynthia answered with a nod. A In the MorgueA“Ducky?!?” Abby questioned excitedly as she nearly missed running into Jimmy as he cleared a work tray for Ducky to set up his personal laptop on. Beside Ducky, Tim had climbed on a chair to reach the overhead socket and plug in the computer into the socket beside the  pull down examination lamp. “We'll have them up in a moment Abby.” Ducky assured her, smiling as Tim took his place, not quite pushing him out of the way to open their secure browser. The connection was barely open before Ziva's face dipped into view, wearing a determined expression that frightened Abby. “Ziva?!?” Abby asked worriedly and grew only more worried when Ziva glanced at her and schooled her expression to one that Abby suspected was supposed to be sympathetic. “Is he...” She couldn't say the words. She knew what the probabilities were and it had been more than 48 hours since Tony had been attacked and taken, but...“We have received photographic confirmation...” Ziva trailed off at Abby's sharp gasp to rephrase her answer, “H-he is alive; we have received a photograph... confirming... this.” Tony was ALIVE! Abby could have squealed with joy at the pronouncement, but when she turned to share an enthusiastic hug with Tim, his expression wasn't at all what she thought it should be. He still wrapped his arms around her waste though, and pulled her into his side, just in time for Ducky to ask:“Was the photograph accompanied by a ransom demand?” “No, Dr. Mallard,” Ziva answered cocking her head curiously. “I do not see why you would believe so.”“You didn't say you'd found him, Ziva,"" Tim answered for Ducky, ""just that you had confirmation that he's still alive, and... your expression suggests that …” Abby could almost feel him glance down at the top of her head when he paused as if trying to decide whether she could take it or not. “The photograph... is … disturbing, but it was not given to us by his captors. There is an observer, in our side, who was able to take the photograph, we are waiting for further information on his location.”“On our side,” Jimmy and Tim corrected at the same time, and Ziva's smile suggested that she had known of the error but had attempted to soften the blow. “Yeah! The bossman will bring him home soon.” Abby let her enthusiasm resurge a bit, glad for Ziva's soft awkward smile in response, then asked, “Did the boss have anything for us to track down?” “Yes, I have sent you the photograph with the information from our source's phone. Gibbs wants you to track down whatever information you can get from it, especially with regard to the call that the photo was sent with. Also, he wishes you to do a full hair to heel background check on two recent suicides from London, Richard Brook and Sherlock Holmes.” ""Head to toe,"" Abby heard Tim supply in a soft murmur that Ziva either ignored or couldn't hear.“Does he think they are connected? Does he think their deaths are hinky? They're not going to do that to Tony. The boss won' let them.” “We do not know. Gibbs has information that he is not telling me, but I do not believe that he knows of these men, he did not say their names like he was familiar with them.” “Ziva,” Tim interrupted her. “You're reaching the three minute mark. If the boss has anything else for us to do wait an seventy minutes and call us back.” “Good bye, Tim.” She acknowledged the others with a nod and closed the connection. “Abby?” Tim asked kissing her on the top of her head to get her attention, why don't you get back to your lab before the Director's decides to come down and check on us. Wait until after she does to get started on it.”“Okay, Tim,” Abby agreed easily, glad to have something to do to help.A…“Ducky...”“Yes, Timothy.” Dr. Mallard answered with a gentle smile. “Can you take a look at the photo and tell me what you think we might be looking at as far as physical damage is concerned?” Tim asked carefully, throwing up a hand when the Doctor was about to protest. “I know that there may not be a lot that a photo can tell you, but it unsettled Ziva, so I suspect that there will be at least clues. Dr. Pitt was able to recommend some surgeons and therapists who specialize in trauma and catastrophic injuries. I want to make arrangements to get the best choices – given his condition - to London as quickly as possible.” “That is very generous of you, young man; I presume that Mr. Gemcity is funding this endeavor?“Yes.” Tim answered, a warm his cheeks, when Abby looked back at him as she reached the door. “Then, of course, I will be happy to assist, and if you will forward the resumes of the Doctors you are considering, I may be able to help you narrow the search.”“Thanks, Ducky.”“Anything for family, my boy. Anything for family.”The doors closed behind Abby, cutting off anything else they might have said.A The Director's OfficeAAfter scanning the passenger manifests of sixteen flights leaving Washington for London, Jennifer Shepard finally found the passengers she was looking for, and cursed under her breath. On Flight BA229 from Dulles to Heathrow, three passengers, in seats 83, 84, and 85, were traveling under a federal security “ghost ride” marker (with names and descriptions withheld – except on request from Homeland Security/CIA). There was a chance that it might not have been Jethro and Ziva, and that their third party wasn't Trent Kort... a slim chance, but the timing was just too close to when all three dropped out of contact... and Jenny hadn't gotten to where she was – as a Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, a Federal director, watch-dogging the military- second only to the Secretary of the Navy- in the agency's chain of command -- by failing to cover slim chances. “Cynthia, I have finished the position posting for a replacement field agent for the MRCT; could you please take it to HR, immediately, and stress that it is to be an internal listing only. Thank you.” She finished as her assistant took the file folder from her hand with a grim, barely sympathetic expression. In truth, Jenny had completed the posting form close to a month earlier, but had been forced to wait for the right opportunity to replace the annoying idiot, who'd had the audacity to think he could replace her in Jethro's life. Once the elevator doors closed behind Cynthia, Jennifer picked up the cellphone that had been sitting in her lap for close to an hour and hit the second button on her speed dial. Brook answered almost immediately, in a strange sing-song that pricked at her nerves almost immediately, “Jen-nnnneeey, to whAt do I oWe the pleASure?” “I was right!” Jenny hissed, “ I told you he was going to ...” “Jenny, Jenny, Jenny... Haven't I done as you asked, so far?” Brook taunted her in a tone usually reserved for appeasing spoiled children, “Didn't I take care of that Nasty, Nasty man, who killed your daddy?”“Yes, I kno--...” she started, before he cut her off, again. “And that, egotistical … now what did you call him... an egotistical … what was it?” “Man-whore.” She bit out snappishly, disliking his reminder of the debts she already owed him... especially related to DiNozzo.“Yes, that was it. The man-whore... well, you should be delighted to know that his ego won't be a problem any more.”“Did you kill him?” She asked, eagerly, hoping that there wouldn't even be a body for Jethro to find when he finally got to London. “Oh Jenn-ny,” he teased, “I am shocked and appalled... Completely! Shocked! And Appalled! That you could be so vicious... in love. Are you this ruthless in war, too?” He giggled, but after a moment, answered, “No, I haven't killed him, not yet. I wanted to play with him first, just to see how talented he is.”Shepard winced; she absolutely didn't want to know this. It would have been one thing if he'd just killed DiNozzo, like he was supposed to... like Kort had been supposed to... even La Grenouille hadn't followed through as she'd hoped he would, on the tip she'd arranged to expose DiNozzo. Damn it!Why wouldn't they just do what she wanted and put a bullet between his eyes?That wasn't the question that slipped out of her mouth though when he chuckled...“So …”  she prompted, more than a little unnerved at her own sick curiosity. “Oh, he's absolutely delicious, but I really don't think nearly as experienced as you thought he was, though; he screamed like a virgin the first few times. But, he's learning, and before long, he'll be a proper little whore. I might even hire him out when I get bored of him.” “It's too dangerous!” Jenny snapped out. “He'll ...” “He'll be on a proper leash; I assure you, and once he tells your little friend Gibbs that he doesn't want to go back, what's your friend to do?

This wasn't the first time that he'd had to hide all responses to his real name on a case, but it had been the first time that he had known from the first that the bad guys knew who he was, and that - it seemed - had made the difference when drugs, exhaustion, and trauma had weakened his resistance, earlier. His reward of a full night's sleep after the subsequent harsh lesson had given him what he needed, though, to submerge himself into his deep-cover/whatever-it-takes-to-survive mindset. Since that night, he'd spent every down moment – not focusing on clinging to who and what might be waiting for him at home – but instead on recalling every lesson and rule he'd learned under Jethor, and the dozen other strategies that he'd picked up on dozens of under cover assignments to create the mask that would give him the best chance of survival. Under the circumstances, that was “Wistar,” a unthinkingly obedient test subject; intelligent but silent unless suffering; modest and inhibited, but submissive to the man's appetites; and ever-watchful for the clues to what the next lesson would bring and what the next trap might be. “It's time to eat, Tony!” James chimed out again behind him, but Tony continued to ignore him despite the  roiling of hunger low in his stomach. Wetting the bar of soap again, he worked up a thick lather and ran it over his face, again, feeling more of the paint dissolve under the repeated washing. “Come eat, DiNozzo, aren't you hungry?' Tony stayed silent, not even glancing in the man's direction as he tipped his head back into the water.  He knew the man was watching him for even the slightest response to his name, and refused to give him a justification for more punishment. As it was, Tony had already mistaken the purpling on his legs for undissolved paint until his scrubbing proved them to be lingering bruises. “Wistar,” the man called softly from behind him, and Tony spun to face him, asking “Sir?”“It's time to eat, Pet.” James's smile was disturbingly smug, but Tony did his best to ignore it, as he followed the man's gesture to the glass topped table, where a full breakfast had been set up. “Thank you, Sir.” Tony offered tentatively, hoping that it wasn't laying it on too thick, but sensing that the man was still waiting for something … that there was another trap there he was waiting for Tony to fall into.Sausages, eggs, two slices of toast, a slice of bacon, a small dish with preserves and butter slices, juice, cream, a sugar dish, coffee... he knew there was something there... stirring spoon, fork, butter knife ... then he saw the catch. Picking up the slice of toast, he completely ignored the butter knife and dipped the tip of the toast into the preserve as neatly as he could, cupping his hand under the toast as he brought it to his mouth and took as small bite. Setting it down, he made a point of moving to the sausages, then the bacon, then the toast, then the juice, pointedly ignoring the eggs and coffee – focusing on only what he could acceptably eat with his fingers.  Laboratory rats didn't use silverware, of course, and he suspected that James would have called him on it if he had tried. “Oh, very good... very good,” the man praised with a delighted giggle as he draped himself over Tony's shoulder to reach for the spoon. Scooping up a bit of the egg, he fed it to Tony, who obediently opened and closed his mouth around it, trying to ignore where James' free hand was roving. AAブレンキンA“Come on in,” Captain Watson gestured into the room ahead of them, taking Ziva's bag from her to set it on the kitchen table as they passed. The man was somewhat smaller than average height, with sandy blonde hair, plain, unremarkable – if somewhat depressed- features, a slight limp that he seemed unaccustomed to, as if it was a recent injury, but otherwise, he seemed rather unremarkable. Ziva was well aware of the danger in that presumption, especially considering that the man was someone that Gibbs had called for assistance. As he had noted, Agent Gibbs seemed to despise working with 'wild cards', civilians, and 'green'/untrained field agents, often pushing them off on Ziva and McGee, unless Tony was especially hyperactive and needed to be kept busy. The unexpected reminder of Gibbs second-in-command brought the photograph that Kort had received back to her mind. Although Tony was frequently an annoyance to her, McGee, and nearly everyone in the office, she would not have wished this form or level of field 'experience' on irrepressible man.Her father often referred to such abuse as seasoning, but Ziva had yet to come to terms with the requirements that her loyalties sometimes forced her to. A quick, clean kill: she could accept that and believed that some people truly deserved to die. Her conscience was easily assuaged in most of those operations. A hard fight, that caused grievous, severe injury, she could accept that as well; it was the cost of picking up a weapon against her. She would not sacrifice her life needlessly, but this... torture where it was unlikely that the victim would have secrets of note; such needless brutality benefited no one and only lowered those whom committed it to the level of animals. “Tea, Officer David?” the captain asked from beside the kitchen sink where he was filling a plug in coffee pitcher with a tin measuring cup. “Yes, thank you.” Ziva agreed returning her attention to the man, who was leaning somewhat heavily on the counter as he bent to pull an enameled tea pot from a lower cabinet. Out of the corner of her eye, she noted that Gibbs was watching the man with concern, perhaps wondering if he'd been mistaken to call. “John...” Gibbs began softly, “I - I'm sorry. I read about what happened to your- friend, and … I saw your blog.” Captain Watson stiffened for a second, but when he turned to face them, his expression was calm and hospitable. “Yes, well...” He paused to clear his throat when his voice cracked slightly and continued, “well, you can understand, I expect why I'll appreciate the distraction.” “Not sure it will be much of a distraction,” Gibbs replied grimly, but Captain Watson shook his head. “Maybe it's more accurate to say that I'd appreciate the chance to cause some destruction, break some windows, blow up a building, maybe shoot someone.” Watson said bluntly with the sort of calm equanimity that Ziva recognized as having been acquired from years of having done exactly that.  Captain Watson, it appeared, despite his common place appearance, attire, and homely flat, had 'experience'. “About that...” Gibbs began but cut off when the tea pot whistled, and Captain Watson turned to pour out a coffee for Gibbs, and teas for her and himself. When Gibbs didn't continue his comment, she took it as a sign that the Captain was one of those men who did not like to discuss 'business' over dinner or drinks, but preferred to preserve the social ritual as a reminder of some semblance of civilized behavior, when they were often called to do 'uncivilized' acts.  Her father was one of these men as well, so Ziva was familiar with the nature of question that it was acceptably to ask without causing offense. “Have you known Agent Gibbs long Captain Watson?” she asked. It was a fairly safe question allowing a yes or no answer, a general reference to a number of years, or leaving an opening for stories if the recipient was so inclined. Captain Watson glanced at Agent Gibbs with raised eyebrows, clearly asking for permission before revealing something. Gibbs answered with a quick nod, but held the Captain's gaze for a minute in a way that Ziva was sure was an order to hold something back. The captain responded with a shrug, “Yes, since Operation Desert Storm. Gunnery Sergeant Gibbs and I were assigned to a...” He paused glancing again at Gibbs, who filled in, “strike team.”  “Well, officially, it was a joint UN 'peace-keeping'...” “Yeah, well 'officially' you were Fifth North Umberlands ...” Gibbs responded with a snort. “That's the Royal Fifth NorthUmberlands Fusilers, to you mate.” Captain Watson responded in the tone of acknowledging a well-worn joke. “I do not understand,” Ziva interrupted, she had heard of the unit before but... “That unit no longer exists and has not since the eighties?” She wasn't entirely certain of the date, but was hardly expecting the error to cause the captain to spit his tea out, causing Gibbs to chuckle. When it seemed that Captain Watson could not recover his composure to explain, Gibbs stepped in, “Some minor bureaucrat in the British government thought that using expired unit id's for their black ops agents was a sound practice, not realizing that if there was a unit well-known enough to be recognized as a legitimate military unit, it might be recognized enough for someone to know that it had been expired. John was only 'officially' assigned to the unit to provide a background id, but was transferred to various infiltration and assault teams as appropriate. I was a military buff for a couple of years before I joined the marines, and the first time I met him and he gave me his rank and designation, I told him it was bullshit.”“Gibbs...” Captain Watson interrupted with a glance toward her. “Mossad. Liaison to NCIS.” Gibbs answered back, and it seemed to be enough to answer whatever question the captain would have asked. “Damn, don't take this wrong, Agent David, but you're too young and ...” He broke off with a laugh when she raised her eyebrow warningly, until he continued, “... smart to be thrown into that kind of action. Might be a good idea to look into another career while you're still young enough to enjoy it.”“So speaks the voice of experience.” Ziva answered, perhaps too sharply, she realized when Gibbs glared at her. “It's harder than you realize, David, to find yourself out of the field, denied your alternate career by ... injury, and alone thanks to your years wearing masks over masks so that no one can know you, identify you, and get revenge. Even if something good comes along – if someone good comes along, you've been caught up in your masks for so long that you can't take advantage of it ...can't let that person get to know you before it's too late. It isn't a career to grow old in, young lady.” The captain fell silent, staring into his tea cup for several seconds, while Ziva glanced helplessly at Gibbs trying to figure out how to apologize for the landmine she had unexpectedly triggered.  To her surprise, though, Gibbs didn't look as angry as she'd expected. Instead, his expression was almost relieved. Catching her eye, he nodded toward the door, and ordered, “Go see what Kort's up to.”Rising carefully, Ziva paused to reach out, wondering if the gesture would be seen as patronizing or not, and briefly rested his hand on the man's shoulder. He didn't look up, but covered her hand and nodded. AAブレンキンA . . . ATKAWhere Are You?ASHA… A SHAYou'd never believe.ATKA…A TKAWhat are you on about?ASH  A…A SHA221 BakerATK  A…A What?!?

His higher ups in both the CIA and MI-5 were pissed with him and blocking him out. If he didn't work this out right, he would literally be a man without a country. “No, but it's complicated,” he answered refusing her with a raised hand. “If it comes to it and the Captain's going to be mixed up in this, Holmes will just have to deal with it.” Ziva's eyes narrowed then widened in a way that worried Kort. …",Trading Markers,24860

I don't know what to tell you about him. He's not like anyone else that I've ever met. Sherlock's brilliant and reckless, and gets... could get himself in the worst sort of fixes all in the name of catching whatever crook or criminal the yard pointed him at.

Don't believe any of that shite they're printing about him; I was there for most of it, and no one will ever convince me that he was lying. He could lie at a change in the wind; don't get me wrong, and he was good at it.

I may have accused him of being cold … of being a mach-ine... but he was one with a heart, a klunky awkward heart, that didn't tell him when something he was about to say just plain off... and he was maddening. He didn't seem to know how us normal humans act, but he was brilliant... truly brilliant at the same time... God, how he shined...He was... he was …”John's face dropped into his hands, and Gibbs was certain that his news was about to turn things very, very ugly.“Were you two... together?”“No, I'm not the same person you knew back then,” John sighed, “Please understand, when we first got together, I thought I understood how devastated you were over the loss of your wife and child, and I hoped I could help. I knew... I understood we weren't anything serious, and that once the mission was over, we'd go our separate ways, and I was okay with that. Then you let your stupid self-destructive streak get in the way, and ended up a six-month coma, and the rest of our unit finished the job and were reassigned. I thought I understood, so I never let anyone else get involved because I didn't want what happened to you to happen to me... I thought I understood, but God, I was wrong.”A…“How did you survive this? It's killing me, and we were never even together. How the hell did you survive this? That's what I want to understand. I've thought about 'cleaning my gun' more than a dozen times, today alone. How did you survive this?”“I'm not sure I will, if it happens again.” Gibbs answered honestly, turning the laptop around and pushing it in front of his friend, the director's shots of him and Tony together scrolling across the screen (he'd set the gallery as the screen saver)... “Tony's been my Sherlock. More than a dozen years, I didn't let anyone get behind the lines. Married a couple of times, but I didn't let anyone get close enough to me to worry about losing them. Always kept them separate. There was them, and there was the work, and the work always won out. Then there was Tony. He snuck in under the radar, at work, got close – at work- without me even knowing it. Annoyed the hell out of me, never quite made me regret offering him the job but came close a couple of times (when he got hurt or got caught up in some kind of trouble he couldn't handle), and then a couple of months ago, after I got my head knocked around by another bomb, I ran off, afraid of everything I couldn't remember. Thought that was it, everything was done and over. I was ready to turn into a hermit He followed me, and let me know what was waiting for me if I could get my head back on straight.”John glanced up from the screen, “You really love him don't you? I've never heard you talk that much in a single breath... about anyone, and before you say anything – I know it hurt too much to talk about Shannon and Kelly. I get that now. I did then, too, but not like this. God... Okay, enough of this, I can fall apart and hide under the bed after we get Tony back. Fill me in, what are we up against.”For the first time in more than a decade, Gibbs hesitated, but finally, he stood, came around the table, and shifted the touch pad to “wake” the screen, then looked away from the photo that Kort had emailed... the photo showing Tony hanging from a hook in the middle of a warehouse, being studied by nondescript man with a receding hairline that the tabloids had identified as being the late Richard Brook, who by all accounts had killed himself 6 days earlier, despite the fact that the photo's time stamp said that it was taken only twelve hours ago.“No, it can't be... it can't be. He's dead. They found his body on the roof of St. Barts. He killed himself just before... the cameras show he killed himself.”“Kort says he pays doubles to get plastic surgery then grabs them and programs them to think and do whatever he want's them to do... in this case, blow their brains out.”“Go-D,” John's voice broke as tears streamed down his face, “Sherlock … killed himself because of this bastard... thinking it was over, that we were safe... and Moriarty's alive. The bastard's still alive.”“John... is there any chance... When Tony was taken, they blew up the car he was in and had planted his id and belongings on whoever was in the car, but he's alive... is there any chance that Sherlock could ...”“No,” John interrupted, scrubbing tears out of his eyes. “No, I was on the street below when... when he jumped... I spoke to him on the phone. I saw him. It was him... and I saw his body. It was him.”Breaking his silence, Gibbs offered, “Kort says he can get us our choice of weapon, what's your preference? I'm going with the M40 A1... I remember you used to use an L96.”“I won't need it.” John murmured as he got up from the kitchen table and opened a cabinet door, reaching for the second shelf.“John...” Gibbs growled warningly, if John thought he was going to just let him walk into …“I won't need it because I still have my L115...” he explained pulling himself up to stand on the kitchen counter beneath the cabinet so he could reach on top of the cabinet and pull the rifle down.“You keep it on top of the kitchen cabinet?” Gibbs asked with surprise.“If I'd kept it in my closet or under my bed, Sherlock would have found it for sure, the man is... was the worst snoop, broke my computer password at least twice a week, but he never did do the grocery shopping and would never have thought about dusting.” John's tone settled to a tone of fond humor as he met Gibbs eyes with determination.They stared at the screen in grim silence, for several seconds, before John finally broke it, “We'll get Tony out, but once we're done with that I get the bastard... Moriarty's mine.”“I know.” Gibbs answered quietly. He'd known from the moment that John had begun talking about Sherlock that Moriarty's fate was sealed.

You deserve another reward, so if you'll hold still while I put your leash on, we can go for a walk.” “Yes, Sir.” The American replied in a trembling voice. Despite his usual opinion of law enforcement officers and detectives, Sherlock had to admit that the American had impressed him... not only in managing to survive the tests that Moriarty had begun to incorporate into his maze, after the American had amazingly managed to detect the code from Moriarty’s game of target practice, using him as the target... but also by the fact that the American had clearly put his mind to the task of discerning the most productive behavior pattern to use with Moriarty's – a task that had tripped Sherlock himself up at first. He truly couldn't say whether he would have done as well if he'd been put under the additional stresses being subject to Moriarty's rapacious appetites. When it came to the American, Moriarty couldn't seem to restrain himself and had forced himself on the American multiple times that morning alone, barely even waiting until the agent had finished eating before bending him over the table and assaulting him. The reminder of that morning's treatment made Sherlock shudder. It was getting harder and harder to stand by, waiting for Mycroft to confirm that this was Moriarty – a fact that Sherlock had quickly become convinced of - from the depth of the man's depraved abuse of his hostage. If this man wasn't Moriarty's – Sherlock suspected he was even worse, or could be if he worked his way into Moriarty's pool of political connections. “Mmmm... Oh... you're sooo good; I almost hate to pull out.” Moriarty sighed, “but then, I wouldn't be able to put this in.” The agent groaned softly, causing Sherlock to ease the small mirror up enough that he could see Moriarty's leaning heavily into the American as he rifled through a drawer in the side of the table before pulling out a small blue object.“Aren't you curious what it is, pet?”“A plug... for my...” “Well, yes... yes, it is that, but that's not all it is... it's quite a nice little leash, too.” Sherlock grimaced at the thought, easily grasping how an anal plug could interfere with the agent's ability to run at full speed, especially if he was correct in his estimation of the size –which must have been fairly large for him to even see it from this distance... but if Moriarty thought that would be enough to stop the agent, Sherlock suspected he was in for an unpleasant surprise. “Here, let me get it in...” Moriarty's voice broke off followed by a rustle of sound, a gasp, and then Moriarty ordering, “That's it... Take it. Take it. I know it's big, but it had to be a little on the chunky side to fit the all that c-4...” Moriarty broke off with a laugh and a short violent shuffling, “Ah, ah, ah... not a good idea to fight... It's almost all the way inside, anyway, and you wouldn't want to take the chance of triggering it, now would you? Good boy, that's it Pet. Just a little bit deeper. There now, it's all the way in.”The American's groaning had turned to whimpers, but whether from pain or fear, Sherlock couldn't say. “Now, let me show you how it works.” Moriarty's voice continued, with amusement. After a moment, Sherlock heard the sounds coming from what he thought was the table's embedded dvd player, and Moriarty began to narrate, “See this is how they're made...I wrap the c-4 around the remote receiver module – look at how small it is. miniaturization these days is an absolute marvel; it's small size let me put close to 150 grams of C-4 around the trigger before I even slipped it in. I added more, of course, to hold it in place so you don't have to worry about jiggling it around. You'll want to thank me for that later. Now watch closely, I know you're smart enough to want to see the evidence of what one of these does, instead of just relying on my word for it... Here it is in a safe.” Sherlock barely picked up the small burst of sound over the American's startled yelp. “Not very much left of the safe, I know... but wait there's more, once it's armed...” A small beep carried to Sherlock's amplifier as Moriarty continued, “like yours is now, you can't take it out without disarming it, which by the way, uses a different code than the one I've taught you. Something I forgot to mention to this young man... now watch what happens when he tries to take it out...” The American cried out in horror at whatever he was seeing, his cry covering over whatever other sounds Sherlock might have heard.“Yes, that rather did make more of a mess than I expected but that's why I thought I should show you how it works before you make a mistake... as long as you don't try to slip the leash, you'll be just fine. Any questions?” “Y-es, Ss-ir,” the American's wavered, “how...how is it.. triggered?” “A very good question, Wistar, one I'll let you to figure out. I'll give you a clue, however: think about how we measure speed, hmm?”“Distance, rate, and time?” The American questioned meekly. “Exactly. Now, I've left you some clothes on your bed, go get ready, and then I'll take you on your walkie.” “Don't...” Sherlock whispered the warning to himself and to the American, despite the fact that the man couldn't possibly hear him. Thankfully, the man had come to the same conclusion, questioning, “Sir... the distance... is the … my bed too far... far enough away from you  to trigger...it?”“Well, yes, it may just be at that, but if you'll come here and do something nice for me, I might just be willing to come over and watch you dress.”Glancing into the mirror, Sherlock was disgusted to see that Moriarty's had returned to the chair that he seemed to prefer to sit in while watching the American being abused.He had sat down and leaned back casually, still unzipped. “Yes, Sir.” The American replied and blocked Sherlock's view of the criminal as he moved into place. Rolling back against the roof, he just barely prevented himself from slamming his head against it in frustration. Their chances of getting the American out alive, just decreased geometrically.

Brooks.” Gibbs corrected.“Moriarity, you mean. The man's so far beyond evil, the devil probably shudders when they cross paths. He's unstable and is... or was completely obsessed with Sherlock. He seemed to see Sherlock as some sort of opponent in a game of wits... and happily killed a score of people in pursuit of his game. He's perversely methodical and possessed of a sick brilliance almost equal to Sherlock's. He's an utter psychopath and probably the second most dangerous man I've ever met.”“Who's the first?”“Sherlock's Brother, Mycroft. He's practically the head under the crown, behind the scenes, from what Sherlock said. A genius who runs a bunch of our agencies and shadier non-existent programs from his secretary's blackberry.”“If that's the case...” Gibbs hesitated as he saw John's eyes flare at his unfinished question.“Why did he let Sherlock sacrifice himself?” John asked harshly, cutting him off.He didn't even wait for Gibbs nod, as he closed his fingers around the stock of his rifle and answered, “That's not a question I've let myself ask. If I had to guess, though, I'd say that – despite his claims that he worried constantly about his brother – God, King, and Country came first. I'm not even sure that Sherlock was a distant fourth.” He paused looking down at his, now, tight grip on the gun and visibly forced himself to let go.Sighing after a moment, John looked up and commented, “Look... I'll get you Sherlock's notes, and you can read them for yourself. If anyone had a bead on the bastard, it was Sherlock.”John stalked out of the room, simmering hatred radiating in his wake. Remembering all too well the feeling, Gibbs paused for a moment to consider his old friend... and himself. He knew without question how easy it would be for John to turn the anger and pain he was feeling, on himself, on the brother, possibly even on anyone else he'd begun to blame rightly or wrongly for his partner's death. They had both had dark sides, even before Shannon and Sherlock's death.Innocents and upstanding men didn't just stumble into black ops careers.

True he'd regretted some of the kills he'd made, especially the one's he'd known from the outset were nothing more than collateral damage, but it had never stopped him from doing his job... and he knew that it had never stopped John from doing it either, although John's specialty had differed slightly from his own.They had both been snipers and not infrequently paired for extraction of critical targets, but after the targets were extracted, before they were killed, John would use his surgical skills, masks of an unassuming personality, and aura of compassion to extract the required information from their targets. After they first met, it had taken some time for Gibbs to reconcile John's innate compassion and mild manner with his willingness to torture and kill their targets until John had explained that he viewed his activities similar to excising cancers and that if he did his job carefully and well, he could even save their target's the pain and suffering they might have received at another interrogator's hands.Needless to say, John had always done his job well, though not always getting the information they'd needed, either from their target's ignorance or innocence, and over time, Gibbs had even polished a few of his own skills from watching John at work, learning to read a target's readiness to talk and how to best use silence to unbalance them.“Here.” The files were slapped down on the kitchen table beside him, but John didn't slow on his way towards the door, grabbing his jacket on the way out as he threw back over his shoulder, “I'm choking for a pint. When you're finished and and ready to plan, you've got my number.”Gibbs nodded understanding, were their situations reversed, he didn't think that he could have sat idly by letting someone read Tony's case notes, possibly critiquing a man the other person had never met based on what he was reading. Anyway, if he was going to be of any use, John needed to take the edge off and had always been able to drink Gibbs under the table without blinking.As the door slammed shut behind his friend, the memory of a song that John had taught him once came to his mind, and the words slipped easily from his lips as he picked up the first of the late detective's files.Oh mama, oh mama comfort meAFor I know these awful things have got to beABut when the war for freedom has been wonAI promise you I'll put away my gun.A shot rang out, I heard a soldier cryA""Oh please don't leave me here alone to die""AI realized his patrol had run awayAAnd left their wounded comrade for me to slay.Oh mama, oh mama comfort meAFor I know these awful things have got to beABut when the war for freedom has been wonAI promise you I'll put away my gun.""There's nothing in this world I would not doAIf there's mercy in your heart you'll let me live""AAnd in his eyes I saw a look of painAAs the muzzle of my gun moved towards his brain.Oh mama, oh mama comfort meAFor I know these awful things have got to beWithin minutes of starting to read, Gibbs understood John's description of his late friend; the man who had compiled the file was clearly brilliant and shared Tony's sometimes erratic sense of intuition, minus the frequent cinematic references, or perhaps with them, but better disguised. There were several times that Gibbs didn't track how the detective had come to the conclusions he had, but was familiar enough with Tony's similar thinking style to trust the conjectures, which painted a clear if daunting picture of their enemy, his resources, and his methods. When he got to Sherlock's notes about their mutual friend being used as a hostage, decoy, and booby trap, his heart clenched briefly in belated sympathy and anger for his friend and fear for Tony. He had promised that John would have Moriarity when they were finished... but it didn't entirely preclude him causing the psychopath some pain before deferring to his friend.In fact, as he continued to read, causing the man a measure of pain seemed to be the most likely way to get Moriarity's attention enough to keep the man engaged and interested enough that he would be. less likely to discard Tony out of hand, if there might be some use to keeping his hostage on hand. While Gibbs didn't downplay his own intelligence, he easily recognized that he was not on the same level that Sherlock or Moriarity had been, and knew that if their extraction plan fell through, they would need something in place to keep Moriarity from going completely to ground and taking Tony with him.A Gibbs couldn't compete in terms of intelligence, but in terms of cold, calculated viciousness? He stood a chance, especially after reading Sherlock's profile of the criminal.Moriarity commonly engaged serial killers and employed mercenaries: in other words, targets who were fair game if Gibbs took the battle to Moriarity instead of waiting for the psycho to bring the fight to him.As if some plan of fate were waiting for his decision, the moment Gibbs closed the last manilla folder, his personal phone buzzed and a simpering sing-song voice chanted:“Gee”A“I”A“Double bb.”“There's something I have”A“You'll want to see!”“Hello Brooks.” Gibbs responded dryly, fighting to keep any trace of anger out of his voice. “Or whatever the name of this week's puppet is.”There was silence on the line for a second, and Gibbs could tell that he had caught the man off guard. Not with the knowledge that Moriarity was hiding behind proxies, but with his lack of reaction to the taunt.“What passes for common courtesy would indicate that it's your turn to respond.” Gibbs offered, hoping to unsettle the man even further, “Unless you'd like to pass.”“No, no, I'm happy to carry my load of the conversation, thank you for the offer, though.” The sing-song voice continued causing the sentence to peak and break oddly as the man spoke.“Certainly, I believe that you were intimating that you have some property I'm interested in seeing?”“Inti – mat – ing,” Moriarity's strung the word out, causing Gibbs to grind his teeth silently at the words he knew would be coming as he lifted the receiver away from his mouth so that the crud wouldn't hear his reaction. “What an interesting choice of words, and so very appropriate. ”“Yes, I'm sure.” Gibbs agreed as if he hadn't assumed anything otherwise, and from the moment he'd seen the mole's photo, he'd known that what Moriarity was implying had been a very likely possibility from how close Moriarity had appeared to be standing, and his posture, which had seemed to have the man almost rubbing himself against Tony. “It's a matter of personal pride, you realize; I rarely indulge in personal entertainments, but when I do... the entertainment is... worth the time I spend in it's company.”Hating the way he was forced to talk about Tony as though the greatest part of his soul was nothing more than a pass time that he indulged himself, Gibbs turned the lap top back around to watch the screen-saver play image after image across the monitor, tracing his finger over his lover's image to calm his nerves and remind himself of  what he hoped to gain by winning the loathsome game.A“Yes. Yes. Of course, I understand completely, and agree. I commend you on your taste in entertainments, Tony has been such exquisite company, so supple and yielding, so responsive. He still has a few bad habits but whimpers so prettily that he's easily forgiven.”AGibbs' teeth felt ready to crack under the force of his grinding as he fought to retain his temper. It was a struggle he was a hairsbreadth from losing when Ziva rushed through the kitchen door and pushed Kort's phone into close into his field of vision. Chilled by the last text he read there, Gibbs forced am note of cool amusement into his tone to reply, “yes, I've always thought so.”A“Surely you must miss his company,” Moriarty sounded both piqued and intrigued by his lack of response, “and would like to meet to retrieve him.”A“Yes, I did come to London to retrieve my property, but I'm in the mood for a diversion. Tell me, Brooks have you ever played horseshoes?”A“No” Moriarity laughed, sounding startled, “Tell me how is it played.”A“Well, the rules are fairly simple. There're only three of them to remember: two targets/three throws, each player takes a turn, and the closest to the target wins. Lets call nipping Tony out from under my nose, your first throw, shall we? That would make it my turn.”A“Ooohoo, THIS sounds like my kind of game!” Moriarity laughed.A“Good, then call me again, tomorrow at six, so we can keep score. “ Gibbs hung up abruptly, severing the conversation before he could lose it.ADropping his face into his hands, he cursed virulently as Ziva shifted back and forth, waiting for orders or explanations. Instead of answering her unspoken questions, though, he tried to type in his own text message, before getting frustrated, and shoving the phone back into her hands.A“Tell him to get me a target. Not Moriarity, the next-closest to him.”",Trading Markers,24860

Now Daddy can't take you on your walkies, and you were doing so well, too. That's what happens though, privileges have to be earned and can be taken away just as easily as they are given.” His pet shivered under his stroking hand, but James suspected, from the slight return of his pet's color, that Wistar was relieved not to see his former partner, and if Shepard was correct, boyfriend. James was  beginning to seriously doubt that that she had been correct, however.First, from Wistar's continuing traumatized reactions, James was nearly 99% certain that the former federal agent had been a virgin, at least with respect to intercourse with another man. Second, Gibbs was not acting as James would expect a lover to act. The man hadn't even inquired after the condition of his missing man, neither asking to hear his voice as proof that he still lived, nor asking about ransom terms, nor even bandying idle threats about the consequences of touching his subordinate again. In fact, Gibbs had hardly even seemed overly interested in bargaining for the man's life - not even demonstrating a trace of jealousy or effrontery at the suggestion that James had so readily enjoyed his pet's services, which James was certain Gibbs would have expressed if he had ever sampled Wistar's delights. Instead, Gibbs had challenged James to a game, noting the sting to his pride of having “his” man nipped right out from under his nose as James' first salvo in the game. James had to admit that he liked the man's style. Instead of lecturing about honor and regaining face like some bleeding yakuza birk, droning on about tradition and the fortitude it takes to get through a Siberian winters like some cossack-wannabe, or alternately posturing like some Italian peacock with his mind stuck in the old world modality of feudalistic family-ties (and his pecker stuck in almost anything that moved)... Gibbs had actually had the style to not only let James know that the other man was coming after him, but the gamesmanship to make his little vendetta interesting. No, none of it fit Shepard's description of the man, and James spared a second to wonder if she had knowingly set him against Gibbs, who was virtually unknown in the circles that James traveled, but ... who presented himself as more than comfortable with the potential. He quickly dismissed the thought, however, Gibbs might have panache, but Shepard?A She had neither the style nor intellect to come up with such a devious though. If anything, it was more than likely that she had simply been blind to Gibbs activities, and James was sure there had been activities in some form or other. One did not simply possess the sense of style that Gibbs had so far displayed, without using it... and from within the very heart of a federal 'law enforcement' agency was a delightfully devious place from which to work.James was actually quite looking forward to meeting the man and discovering how he had kept himself from drawing James's notice, despite his thorough investigation into Dear Jenny's past. ... Perhaps he should even let her live afterward... as a finder's fee of sorts. It was a thought.  Perhaps, if Gibbs proved as entertaining as he had so far...Gibbs' choice of game was promising and strikingly fitting (three strikes each, close to but not necessarily hitting the target, suggesting that Gibbs had a reasonable understanding and appreciation of the demands of James' other business operations and that he had selected a challenge that could easily be managed without disrupting his day-to-day activities) to the confidence he'd  shown in setting their upcoming appointment, even though he'd hardly been in the country six hours, barely enough to develop a confident enough lay of the land to claim that he would be ready to take his 'first throw' and have it counted by 6 pm the next day. Smiling indulgently down on his pet, who was looking decidedly more relaxed now, undoubtedly thinking that he was going to get out of seeing... or more to the point, being seen by his former partner... James thought with amusement how much he'd enjoy his pet's reaction when he discovered they would still be meeting the next afternoon. AIt was a tidbit of information James decided he might let wait until the next morning, electing to enjoy both Wistar's ignorant relief, and leave enough time before their meeting to stretch out and savor Wistar's anxiety about meeting with the man... perhaps even amplify it. Sliding the phone lid back up, he sent three quick text messages to one of his onsite servants, requesting his meal, a few supplies, and authorizing a purchase, in the servant's name of course, from a local adult toys' supplier the man frequented. “Come, pet, that doesn't mean that we won't do something, just that we won't be getting out, so you won't be needing your pretty clothes.”“Yes, Master.” Wistar rose gracefully, before beginning to undress when it was clear that James had no intention of moving.“Slowly, pet, make it sensual.” James ordered, smiling with amusement as his pet shuddered, certain once again that the man had been a virgin to other men. AHis pet could barely even stand to be looked at, especially beneath James's intimate gaze, seeming to take the semi-public exposure to James' servants akin to locker room indecency, embarrassing, but mostly ignored.Wistar's fumbling attempts, though clumsy, were distracting enough that James was content to wait while his servants brought in his meal with a small side plate for his pet. Snapping his fingers, he called Wistar to kneel and smiled indulgently at how quick his pet was to obey. AJust a little more training, and he was certain that he would be able to take his pet out in public; though, he was certain it would be a while before he would trust Wistar without the leash. Still, all in all, Wistar had adapted quite quickly, and perhaps, his pet did deserve a small reward. Maybe a bit of jewelry... or a new collar or chain... something to help Wistar remember his place when  James let him go out without his leash... the three concepts blended into a truly delicious thought, and James grinned as he tapped Wistar's chin. When Wistar obediently opened his mouth, James pushed his pet's bottom lip to widen the gap and poured the au jus into his pet's mouth, ordering Wistar to hold it just there and absolutely not to swallow until he was told. Satisfied that Wistar understood, James sat back and toyed with the different possibilities of his treat for his pet, occasionally dipping his a piece of the tender beef or yorkshire pudding into the savory au jus.A The possibilities were just so entrancing that James barely noticed finishing his lunch until his fork came back empty, and he'd eyed the plate with an amused chuckle. At least, he'd been aware enough to at the first to savor the repast before becoming entranced with the equally delicious thoughts of everything that he would like to do to his pet's body. Even though he'd finished, James was pleased to see that Wistar had not prematurely swallowed the remaining au jus, but was patiently waiting for his orders. Picking up a small slice of the tender beef, James pinched it between two fingers and slipped it into his pet's mouth. “Here we are, pet. Have a taste.” Wistar obediently closed his lips around James' fingers when he didn't release the piece of beef, and after a moment began to suck on the slice. Eventually, James released the bit of beef and sighed with false remorse. He'd planned to hold the bit of meat long enough that Wistar couldn't suck on the piece of meat that long without swallowing the au jus. “Such a shame. This just won't do; we'll have to hold off on the rest of your meal until cook can draw another cup of au jus.” His pets were much more servile and attentive, James found, when he kept them hungry and hopeful that they would receive a bit of food, if they'd just behave up to his standards. Wistar's disappointment was almost palpable, but James pushed it aside without a qualm. If Wistar was entertaining and performed well in the little game being set up for him, he'd earn the rest of his meal, if not then it would be an object lesson to do better the next time. A soft cough from the video room announced that game was ready, and James caught Wistar's hair to lead him into the room. “While you were undressing, pet, I've had the boys hard at work setting up a little game for our entertainment.” Wistar froze for a second, not answering, but a tug on his hair brought him back into line, with a hurried, “Thank you, Sir.” It wasn't as enthusiastic as James might have liked, but his earlier phone call had left him in a very good mood, and his later plans for playing with his pet were still humming through the back of his thoughts, so he decided not to punish his pet for now. Instead, he waived to the video table, the only visible change to its earlier set-up was that the chain and hook on the roller track had been pulled to a position directly over the table and a shiny new choke collar was hanging from its hook. “Tell me, pet,” James began, mimicking Gibb's earlier question, “Have you ever played 'Hangman'?”Wistar let of a startled whimper, but before he could fight, James gestured and his servants were there dragging the man over to the video table and securing his ankles to the table before forcing his hands up to grip the edge, but not locking them down – as James explained gleefully, “There are just three rules: move your hands or guess a wrong letter, and you lose a turn” (James flicked the remote as he spoke retract the chain a bit to demonstrate and smiled Wistar's wide stare before he continued); “any time you guess a letter right, you get a little reward – of my choice- of course; and any word you get right, we're going to do.” When Wistar tried to pull away from the choke chain being dropped around his neck, James stage whispered, “Don't worry, pet. Just to make things easier, I've taken a lot of the possible words off the board, even though they're some of my favorites: like mutilation and disfiguration... You've been such a good boy that I've decided to only use the sexual ones.”As he spoke, the monitor came to life and ---------------------- … 22 slashes filled the screen.",Trading Markers,24860

Gibbs bit out pushing his temper down. For the past half-hour he'd been reviewing the short clip, sent by Holmes, of Moriarty playing his version of 'pin the tail' on the donkey with Tony, and if he didn't act soon, there was a very real chance that he would lose the edge his anger gave him as his rage threatened to slip from his control.AMaking matters worse, as he waited for John to return from the pub, was the knowledge that he was going to have to be the one to break the news to his friend that the man he had been grieving over to the point of considering suicide was alive and had been actively maintaining the ruse in order to protect John: a fact that would only make matters worse, when it was compounded with the fact that John had withheld his true military background from Sherlock and might have been kept in the loop if Sherlock had known.AHe knew that Sherlock, himself, had been torn about risking the possibility of being spotted by Moriarty, in his attempt to grab Moriarty's second in command, a sniper by the name of Sebastian Moran, fearing that if he were spotted, it would turn the man's attention back to John, and had only complied after Gibbs vaguely sketched out his plan. While it didn't help his planning, Gibbs did appreciate the humanity implied by that small bit of apprehension. From the comments that John had made, and the ruse he'd been running on John, it could have gone either way.ADespite his misgivings, though, when Sherlock offered himself up as a second hostage for Moriarty, Gibbs hadn't hesitated to agree; quickly recognizing that Moriarty would not be able to so easily contemplate having someone else take the victory that he'd thought to have over Sherlock. How they were going to explain it to John was an entirely different matter though. Pushing that thought aside, he wrote down the number McGee gave him, and ordered him to keep working on the other numbers that he'd tracked from the number to stations in Austria, Berne, Saudi Arabia, Beijing, and Brazil. It would be a push, but unless Moriarty caught wind of it, everything would be in place for the planned meeting time.ABetween calls, Gibbs grimaced at the seventh text message he'd fielded from Holmes in as many minutes, all to the same end, ""If you want my cooperation, KEEP JW OUT OF THIS!!!!  SH."" As much as he appreciated the man's sentiment, his answer wasn't going to change. He knew John, what he was and wasn't capable of how he worked, how his mind worked, and how his heart worked. He knew what to anticipate from John, with regard to Moriarty. Holmes, though, regardless of whose brother Holmes was and whose lover Holmes was, Holmes was an unpredictable wildcard: similar enough to Tony that he would have banked on the man in any other event, but not to stack the deck when it was Tony's life at stake.APunching the call option at the bottom of the text, Gibbs waited until Holmes began to question whether he was an idiot to risk everything by ringing the phone of a contact whom might be close enough to be heard by the suspect if… and cut the man off, ""John's non-negotiable, you're not. You want in, I have a use for you. You don't, stay the fuck out of the way. John says you're smart, so I'm sure that you don't need me to tell you what will happen to you if you do anything that ends up with my agent being hurt. ""A""Your lover you mean."" Holmes retorted sharply, as if the information was a weapon he could wield against Gibbs.AMaybe, Holmes wasn't as bright as John thought; then again, without knowledge of his and John's shared past, there really wasn't any way for Holmes to guage the man he was challenging. Keeping that thought in mind, Gibbs allowed himself a dry, unfelt smile as he answered: ""Yes... if nothing else, that should give you an idea of how serious I am about what I will do to you if you do  anything that results in Tony being injured. Ask yourself whether there is anything you wouldn't do to protect John, on whether there is any harm you would not visit on someone who injured him? And then magnify that feeling to accommodate the fact that - unlike yourself and John - Tony and I were willing to risk our lives and careers to be together... for a clue to how serious I am. I can and will do this without you; but John has the skills and experience that I need and is one of the three people I would trust to have my back.""A""And while he has  'your back' "" Holmes asked snidely, ""Just who will be watching his?""A""Your choice."" Gibbs answered bluntly, not above exploiting the man's interest in John, if it would help him get Tony back. ""You can either trust me and my team to have his back, or agree to follow my orders and be there when everything goes down. You have ten seconds to decide, and I have more phone calls to make, so either join up or hang up and let me get back to work.""AFrom the short run of shocked silence that followed his answer, Gibbs suspected that no one may have ever spoken to Holmes in that manner before, which was just as well as far as he was concerned. Agents and operatives were much easier to control when they didn't have pre-conceived notions.A""Fine,"" Holmes answered abruptly, before throwing in, ""but don't tell John that I'm still…""A""No deal. John won't be left out of the loop on anything. Wouldn't work if he were. Those are my terms; take them or leave them.""A""You don't understand,"" Holmes retorted, ""This isn't Moriarty's only operation, neither John nor your partner will be safe if Moriarty's not taken down completely, and I need to remain dead for that to happen…""A""What do you think my other calls are about? We're bringing them all down tonight, and if he's taken alive, he'll be cooling his heels in Guantanamo indefinitely. Now, wait for my call, then grab Moran and get him back here asap.""A""But your agent…"" Holmes protested, drawing one of Gibbs' first genuine smiles at the small show of concern for Tony.A""Moriarty is going to be bringing Tony to us, if only to have the opportunity to boast about his success in grabbing Tony right out from under my nose.  Anyway, it's safer for Tony if we can get Moriarty out on open ground instead of somewhere he's bunkered down and fortified. Now hang up and wait for the call, Damn it. I have other arrangements to make.""AブレンキンASnapping his cellphone shut with a silent curse for the intransigent American, Sherlock stepped back to the decrepit office's window, put his shoulder to the inside frame as he crouched, and using the frame to balance a small extension mirror - slid the mirror out the window to check whether there were any of Moriarty's men visible from the next building over or the alley below. Once he had confirmed that his route was, for the moment, clear, Sherlock carefully climbed out of the third floor window and gripped the upper inside frame as he stood and positioned the tips of his trainers on the thin ornamental ledge that ran from window to window and around all sides of the brick building.AAlthough Moriarty had carefully ruined most of the surreptitious routes into the building (electrifying the the fire escape from the second floor on, jimmying away both the office's and warehouse's drain pipes from twenty feet up, barring the windows on the first, second, third, and fourth floors, etc.), it had not taken Sherlock extensive study or time to identify four remaining approaches: two obvious traps (well one obvious and one only obvious if you held a moderate grasp Moriarity's tendencies - by which to say Mycroft would have stumbled into it as blindly as Lestrade, or worse, Anderson), Moriarity's own escape route subtly unguarded - but no doubt booby-trapped, and the indirect route to the unguarded-roof that Sherlock was now taking.AHaving dismantled the easily accessible section of the drain pipe and barred the windows on the side between the warehous he was in and the abandoned office building that Sherlock had just climbed out of, Moriarty had failed to consider that there might be someone motivated enough to risk edging along a ledge of ornamental brickwork - only inches wide- for close to twenty feet (on this side of the building, and another fifteen once he clambered around the corner) while leaving himself completely indefensible to shots from below as he clung to the wall, then clambered up the remaining length of drain pipe up to the office building's roof, and cross another length of pipe, dangling from the pipe as he pulled himself across it, hand over hand.AAdmittedly, it had probably been a safe assumption on Moriarty's part, but one Sherlock was certain he would never have made, if he were aware that Sherlock had survived his ruse. Still it was a time consuming trip, and he would not have admitted it, Sherlock felt an uncommon concern for the American agent. He had already been torn between his earlier decision to leave the American un-observed and un-protected even to the limited extent that Sherlock could have protected him by causing some distraction for Moriarty to give the agent ... relief in some small amount if it seemed critical (as the distraction would have undoubtedly been an one-time event) - and his failed attempt to persuade/browbeat the man's partner and lover into pursuing his plan without John's involvement.AHis concern proved justified as he edged far enough into the skylights just edge that he could inspect the warehouse below without casting a shadow. Moriarty was crouched over the nude American, who laid un-moving, seemingly unresponsive on the warehouse floor, even as one of Moriarty's henchmen appeared to be suturing the agent's genitals to  abdomen and nodding a confirmation in response to Moriarty's order to keep the stitches ""deep, tight, and close"". The man beneath them did not twitch or otherwise respond, even once, through the entire ordeal, and from the unsatisfied sigh that Moriarty gave when his employee finished his work and tied it off, Sherlock could tell that the agent had denied him the expressions of pain, anguish, and terror that the Moriarty seemed to crave, as well... and that - moreover - it had not been an act to bide his time and dissuade Moriarty from torturing him further.AMoriarty's last-bid effort to work a response from the agent was an order to the henchman to begin again, this time running sutures from the prone man's perineum to his slit, with broad ""crisscross"" stitches with width of his shaft to be ""pulled tight and tied off at every half inch"". It went without saying that the result would make any form of stimulation more agonizing as the skin was pulled taut. As if to bring that point home to the still unresponsive man, when the henchman had finished, Moriarty followed up with a command to 'milk him dry'.AWhen the act was finished, though Sherlock could only discern its completion by the henchman removing his hand from the American's groin and moving to stand with an apprehensive gaze to his employer - Moriarty flung himself back into his seat and stared at the unresponsive agent for several long minutes before he finally waved his hand with a dismissing gesture. The only certainty that Sherlock that the man continued to breath was Moriarty's evident disappointment at not winning a reaction from the man and the order he gave his men a moment later:A""Boys have your fun…"" Moriarity called out to his hidden guards and snipers, ""but, don't kill him. He may have lost most of his entertainment value, but I'm curious how our new friend will react to his pet's state.""ASickened by the hurried clatter of eager footsteps down the metal ladders and gangways, Sherlock threw himself away from the skylight, refusing to watch the further defilement of the agent's body. While the piggish grunts and groans of Moriarty's men still carried to the window, he ignored them as he stared at his phone trying to decide his next course of action.AWould it be more detrimental to tell Gibbs, who was in the midst of attempting to destabilize factions of Moriarty's network  - seemingly with Mycroft's assistance - given Kort's involvement … that his partner and lover had broken under Moriarty's attention? Or would it be better to let him make his arrangements for the other cells to be wrecked to any extent possible and leave him to face the fact in the midst of a confrontation when he would need his wits to deal with Moriarty's machinations even if it meant he might make a fatal mistake but could serve to undermine Moriarty's operations.AHis decision wavered for about half-a-second before he drug out his phone, opened it with a silent curse, and quickly punched in a number he had hoped not to need.

Sherlock had warned him almost instantly.""You bloody Wanker!"" John hissed into his cellphone. ""You'd best be glad that I've more 'n a pint, else you'd be sporting shiners to your wake.""""John, if I had given you any clue that I had survived, much less what we were planning to do with the opportunity my supposed death allowed , I have no doubt but that you would have thrown yourself right into the thick of it. For the noblest reasons of course, but I could not risk … I was not willing to … Moriarity is not just a street thug you could overpower or a dying cabbie whom you could speed the end of with a well placed shot. Moriarity had snipers targeting, you, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade, but especially you. Do you know what I saw when I looked down from the roof of St. Barts, as we spoke? Do you?""Sherlock's tone as he repeated the question, whether he was aware of it or not, reflected some of the fear and desperation that John could sense he must have felt before his seeming suicide… and John felt his anger wane in a flush of resignation tinged with guilt. If Sherlock had known about John's skills and background, would he have been so ready to perpetuate the farce?""What?"" he asked softly, understanding that Sherlock needed to get the answer out. ""A laser-targeting point on the bricks behind you. If I hadn't jumped… John, I had to.""""If you hadn't jumped… You truly jumped? It wasn't a body thrown over?"" That was only way John could reckon it had been done. ""It wouldn't have worked if there were. The sniper, remember? He was positioned where he could target you and certainly see me. The only options I could were either to take the risk that you could move behind a sufficient shield if I warned you or jumping. There was no way of knowing if he was the only sniper, what caliber of rounds he was using, or the sufficiency of the shield you chose. I didn't have a choice."" ""You bloody well did."" John protested wondering how Sherlock's fabulous mind had failed him in that instant - letting him believe that taking such a risk was warranted, simply to protect John. ""And, how did you survive it anyways? That couldn't have been your body on ... How did you?""""We don't have time to really discuss this.""""We bloody-well do. Sherlock, I have to know...""""I told you not to say my name! If someone hears you."" ""Sherlock! Sherlock! Sherlock!"" John hissed angrily.""Why do you persist in..."" Apparently deciding to forestall the insult that John could almost feel down the line, Sherlock  sighed a thick- frustration laden sigh. After a moment, though, he did finally answer, ""The canopy... St. Bart's canopy. I don't know if it was the gift of a forward-thinking bureaucrat or a safety feature put in place by a harassed administrator in case one of the loons broke from the mental ward, but the canopy below was made to break falls without breaking bones. It still blasted hurt, but it stopped my descent sufficiently that I only need roll off the edge and land properly. Chance favored the event further by allowing one of Moriarity's recently deceased victims to be delivered for Molly's attentions at that moment. In an astounding- even to me- show of unprecedentedly quick thinking on her part, and no doubt against her better judgement, Molly spared several pieces of the deceased's skin and bones to provide a realistic image and before other onlookers could see what had happened, and declared me dead.  Onlookers appeared to be sufficiently horrified to ignore the slight evidence of my breathing and with three broken ribs, a wrenched shoulder, and a dislocated knee, my pallor suited the farce."" Somehow, despite his shock, at the realization that his eyes hadn't deceived him that day, John managed to pick up the key detail that Sherlock had left out of his altogether too-brief summary. ""Did you know about the canopy?""""John, we don't have time...""""Did. You. Know. Before. You. Jumped?""John suspected he knew the answer already (if Sherlock had known, he would have undoubtedly credited his brilliance for allowing him to come up with such a ready and effective farce instead of trying to avoid the question), but he still needed to hear the answer... needed to know if Sherlock had jumped anticipating his own death... to save John. His question was met with an uncomfortable silence, which was really answer enough for John, even though he pushed, ""You didn't, did you?"" ... his voice going unaccountably soft as he did. ""No."" Sherlock finally answered, his dry choked whisper carrying more emotion than John had ever guessed that he possessed. ""Okay,"" John offered, before letting him off the hook, ""There has to be a reason for you to call me right now. What is it?""""The American, Gibbs, what type of man is he?""""Why?"" John questioned fearing the worst.""The agent he is attempting to retrieve, while still alive, appears to be in a near catatonic state. How will Gibbs react?""""Shite, it won't be good. He's alive?"" ""As of my last observation, yes. I believe Moriarty... Moriarty's alive by the way... Moriarty wishes to see Gibbs reaction to his agent's state."" Now that his shock was dissipating, John could more easily hear the subdued-edginess and dark notes in Sherlock's tone.  He couldn't help but wonder what shape Sherlock was in. His friend had out and out admitted to having been pretty seriously injured in the 'fall' and -more to the point- had never been one to take even adequate care of himself. If Mycroft had let Sherlock run rampant in the name of taking the kingdom's worst enemy down, there was no telling how underfed, sleep-deprived, and unfit his friend might be. Speaking of Mycroft, though, John asked the other question they needed to take into consideration, ""Is there any chance that Mycroft will try to interfere?"" ""No, my Dear Brother, has given his approval for the extraction on my assurance that we have located the true Moriarty. We have."" ""That's good news. We might have had a problem, otherwise. If DiNozzo's still ... recoverable, Jethro will probably be content with destroying his network, and letting us make the final decision - if our mutual enemy survives their meeting. If DiNozzo doesn't make it, Mycroft could install him to the throne, to pay whatever ransom was being asked, and Gibbs would still take the head-shot without blinking or worrying about the consequences.""""How do you know this man, exactly?"" Sherlock challenged, and he might be fooling himself, but John thought he heard a trace of jealousy, but dismissed the thought as Sherlock continued, ""And which 'skills and experience"" was he referring - refusing to distance you from this...""""Sherlock,"" John interrupted as he reached the flat's steps. "" I promise I will tell you everything when this is over, but I can't get into it, right now. I'll break the news.""""John, wait!"" Sherlock demanded, ""You haven't answered my question: how will he react? Can he be trusted to ..."" ""Yes. Sherlock, Jethro Gibbs - of all people- can be trusted with this. Don't worry. He's a professional."" John paused momentarily before giving into the slightly vindictive impulse to leave Sherlock with a parting shot, ""We both are,"" and snapping the phone shut. His hand had barely closed around the handrail when a dry, malice-filled voice stopped him in his tracks.""I knew it. Jim is going to be thrilled to hear that his favorite playmate isn't as far out of reach as he thought."" It wasn't a voice he recognized, but when he turned, the man's features were ones he remembered quite well from Sherlock's case files: he was staring into the chill, soulless gaze of Sebastian Moran.",Trading Markers,24860

PotterAABoy was lost in a fog.  He was confused, he’d never had troubles waking up, usually from Dudley or Mr. Dursley jumping on the steps above his cupboard or Mrs. Dursley pounding on his cupboard door for him to wake up and start breakfast.  Pain was there, just under the daze.  It gave him a comforting sense of familiarity.  Boy knew pain, he didn’t know this fog.ASounds started to penetrate the fog, coming hand-in-hand with the pain.A“…tter?”A“I think he’s coming around.”  John Watson called out to the hovering men which had grown by one in the two days since the child – now known as Harry James Potter – had arrived in his operating room.AThe Holmes men had taken turns sitting by the lad’s bedside, with Lady Holmes, Mrs. Hudson, and Anthea-not-Anthea swinging through with provisions or dragging one of them off to the residents’ lounge to kip on one of the cots.  They’d been joined by a formally dressed man who brought to mind a gentleman from before the industrial revolution.  He’d been introduced to John and the other younger men as Gawain, Lord Wallace.AAnd the true guardian of the little one in question.AIt’d been explained to him – the kidnapping, falsified records, etc – when Lord Wallace arrived.AA weight was lifted off his shoulders when he realized that the heavily muscled Lord wasn’t the author of the marks, scars, bruises, and breaks that riddled his patient’s body and were consistent with damage from a large male – mostly.A“Mr. Potter.”  Bright, striking green eyes fluttered open as the bed instantly became ringed by the anxiously waiting group.  John honestly wasn’t sure if the child would ever wake up without magical intervention.  For his health they needed to wait until he was stabilized before moving him so a Healer could take over his care.AIf they could even find a Healer they could trust with him.A“There you are.”  The gentle man smiled down at the pain-medication hazed eyes.  “Welcome back.”A“Where am I?”  Boy asked with a tremor apparent in his dry throat.  One of the men watching him – tall and lanky with a scarf knotted nattily around his neck – reached over and snagged a covered glass, holding the straw up to his mouth.  Boy drank thankfully, giving the tall man a small smile.  Frowning he looked around, failing to recognize anyone he was surrounded by.  “Who are you?”ASeveral pairs of eyes carried on a silent conversation before Siger stepped forward and took the lead.A“You’re in the hospital, Mr. Potter.”  He said with the firmness of a two-time father.  “You were found – hurt – by the police and brought here.  Dr. Watson,” He motioned to the nice man who was there when Boy first woke up.  “Contacted my son Sherlock to help find your family.”ASherlock was the man with the water glass, Boy gathered before shaking lightly from fear he couldn’t quite control as what the man had said.ADoctor Watson.AHis family.AThree things Boy had been told Freaks like him either weren’t allowed around in the case of police and doctors or didn’t deserve.AHe’d made the mistake of called Mrs. Dursley “Aunt” one-time when the cat lade from Magnolia Crescent told him they were his Aunt, Uncle, and Cousin.AMr. Dursley hurt him worse than ever before or since for that.AFreaks didn’t have family and were not allowed to call normal people Aunt, Uncle, or Cousin.A“Easy little one.”  The nice Dr. Watson interrupted Mr. Sherlock’s father.  “You’re not in trouble.”AJohn soothed the visibly panicking child.  And no wonder.  Lord Holmes would’ve been well served by leaving out the part about Sherlock looking for his family.A“Indeed you’re not.”  Siger agreed, nodding his head at Dr. Watson.  “Nor do you have to worry about returning to those people.”AFrowning, Boy tried to understand.  Finally unable to make head nor tails of it he voiced his main problem.A“Who is Mr. Potter?”  He asked innocently.A“You are Harry.”  Lord Wallace said hoarsely, hanging onto his temper by a thread.  What had been done to his future Lord?  To the child he’d long thought of as an honorary grandson?  “That’s your name.  Harry James Potter.”A“I have a name?”  Green eyes widened in awe.AJohn took over for the others, all of them needing time to rein in their tempers.  Sad as it might seem, that wasn’t even in the top ten of horrible things John had heard between his military career, time spent helping Sherlock solve cases, or working at the free clinic.  Though his wounds were some of the worst he’d ever seen on a child.A“Yes, Harry.”  John confirmed as he checked his pulse.  “No matter what you were told before, your name is Harry James Potter.  And we’re all here to make certain you’re taken care of.”AThe newly-dubbed Harry beamed up at the nice Dr. Watson.A“Okay.”  He agreed sleepily as he fell back under the influence of his medications.  “I can be Harry.”A…AOut in the hall, Gawain paced furiously, trying in vain to expend some of his rage before his magic escaped his control along with his temper.AThe Holmes men on the other hand were quietly seething against the wall, all of them being sent from the room while John examined his patient to decide whether or not Harry could be safely moved via magical means to Ravenscroft Hill, the seat of the mundane Holmes Lordship.AOnce Harry was cleared for travel Lord Wallace would be transferring him via medical port-key.  It was tentatively agreed that Siger and Margeux Holmes would take guardianship so Harry could stay under Dr. Watson’s care until a Healer could be found.  Not to mention that no one in the mundane world could keep him safer.  With help from Siger’s brother the magical Lord Holmes as well as the Potter Regent Lord Wallace he would be as magically protected as he could be as well.AWhich was all moot if they couldn’t get him well enough to go to Gringotts and confirm with the goblins that Lord Wallace is the Potter Regent and was legally supposed to have custody of the Potter Heir.AWithout that step being taken there was nothing to stop the Minstry or Dumbledore from trying to throw him back with the Dursleys.ATrying being the operative word.AIf they thought the war against Voldemort was bad they had no idea the level of damage the Most Ancient and Noble Houses of Holmes and Wallace could unleash on them.AAnd that was before one counted their respective allies, Holmes being a traditionally Grey-to-Dark Family and Wallace being Light-to-Grey.AThe three Holmes men: Siger, Mycroft, and Sherlock; and Lord Wallace all turned to face John as he joined them in the hall.  A veteran Doctor with a decorated military career, he still felt a chill tingle down his spine at being the focus of four such intense men with their ire up.  Running his hands wearily through his hair he gave a soft sigh then gave them what they were waiting for.A“It’s close.”  He said, his exhaustion rapidly catching up with him.  “At this point all we’re doing is managing his pain and praying he doesn’t come up with an infection.  He’s…plateaued.  If I had any other option I would say that he’s not to be moved since it runs such a risk of destabilizing him.  But I don’t.”  He shrugged then nodded towards Lord Wallace.  “You can move him to Ravenscroft in the morning.  Any longer and the risk of infection outweighs the risk of the port-key causing complications.”A“Thank you, Dr. Watson.”  Gawain said formally then turned to Siger Holmes as the doctor dragged Sherlock away towards the residents’ lounge to get some sleep.  “If you would key myself and Heir Potter into the Ravenscroft wards I will return tomorrow with the port-key.”A“You’ll be keyed in.”  Siger agreed.  “When my son returns I will adjust the wards personally.  In the meantime Mycroft has filed – and buried – temporary guardianship papers in the mundane world giving over guardianship of one ‘John Doe’ until his situation can be reviewed.”A“Thank you, Lord Holmes.”  Gawain gave him a deep bow from one Lord to another.  “The House of Wallace is in the debt of the House of Holmes.”AThe two Lords clasped hands then Gawain disapparated with a barely audible “pop”.AMycroft who’d been working on his smartphone and staying conspicuously quiet during the preceding conversations, looked up once he’d been assured privacy with his father.A“This is a political nightmare.”  He noted casually.  “I’ve seen this Dumbledore in action – as well as the newly-minted Minister for Magic Fudge.  If either of them catches wind of Harry Potter being removed from his so-called guardians before Wallace can get the boy to the goblins it’ll be a minefield.  The Lords haven’t been actively managing the magical world in years, since before the rise of Grindlewald.”A“Mmm.”  Siger hummed in agreement, wanting to see where his son’s incisive political mind had gone.  Holmes men who were involved in the mundane world focused their talents in certain areas.  Sherlock used his magical ability to see and deduce connections and facts, solving crimes that baffle police.  Mycroft however took after himself, using a complex combination of insight and foresight to prevent wars and conflicts before they could even begin.  He trusted that his son knew who to avert the disaster none of them wanted to happen.AHis son nearly growled at the none-answer, stabbing his umbrella downward and shoving his phone away.A“If that happens.”  He nearly bit out, temper getting the best of him after two days of worry and machinations.  “If the Ministry and Dumbledore try and interfere further with Heir Potter, the Lords will lose their collective minds – including Uncle Sherrinford.  It’ll be the coup Voldemort wished he could orchestrate.”AIt was little known – especially to the British magical populace at large – but the Ministry only serves at the leisure of the Lords.AAnd not any Lords.AOriginally there was seven Royal Houses – nicknamed the Avalon Seven – who each controlled one of the seven kingdoms of Avalon.  After they disappeared the Wizarding World was ruled jointly between the seven Utmost Ancient and Noble Houses who’d served the three oldest of the Avalon Seven as Stewards.  Once those were pared down to three themselves – the Potters, Ollivanders, and Longbottoms – a Privy Council of the three Stewards and the seven Most Ancient and Noble Houses who’d served the four younger of the Royal lines was created.AThe Ministry and Dumbledore – who was a commoner – trying to control the Potter Heir would be the one thing that would force the constantly at-odds Privy Council into re-forming and reforming the Ministry.ADestabilizing an already-unstable society after only two years of peace.A“What’s the solution?”  Siger asked with faux-idleness.AMycroft looked off down the hall at seemingly nothing.  However his father knew that he was likely examining what his gift was showing him to protect Britain as a whole – magical and mundane.A“An illusion.”  He said after several long moments.  “We convince Lord Wallace – who clearly wants blood – to wait to seek vengeance against Heir Potter’s former guardians.  Then we cast an illusion over his former residence,” Mycroft couldn’t bring himself to call a place where the child was brutalized a home.  “That makes whoever comes to check on Heir Potter believe that he’s still in residence and that all is well.  Better yet if young Mr. Potter has someone in his life who is obviously there to keep an eye on him that can either be subverted or Confunded.  Letters to mundane-born or raised children don’t go out until eleven for Hedwig’s Institute or private tutoring and study groups to prepare them for Hogwart’s at thirteen.  Mr. Potter also can’t be confirmed as Lord Potter until eleven.  That gives us just over seven years to train him for the political hurricane he’ll be in the center of when his caretakers’ abuses come to light.”ASiger only had one thing to say about his son’s rather thorough plan.A“Us?”  He arched a brow.  After all, Lord Wallace was the boy’s rightful guardian.A“Us.”  Sherlock echoed his brother, having returned after settling John into one of the cots for some much needed sleep.  “Who else but the Holmes’s could prepare an innocent, deprived child for the rigors this one was seemingly born to?”AMycroft smirked genially.A“Quite right.  Now who wants to tell Mummy?”A…AIt took another three days, numerous Anti-Infection and Pain-Relieving Potions (they couldn’t use any other magical remedies due to fears of the now-temporary metal pins becoming fused with muscle or bone), and countless hours of hovering on the parts of John and Mummy…also known as Lady Margeux Holmes nee Hawkins, of the Aged and Honorable House of Hawkins, for Harry to recover enough to survive flooing to Gringotts – a courtesy the goblins were only extending because the Potters were one of their oldest and richest clients.APortkeying was out of the question and apparation wasn’t even thinkable the goblins weren’t about to alter their wards even for a second, no matter who it was for.AAs it was, flooing was the sole privilege of the Gringotts employees and only their best customers in unusual circumstances – which definitely applied.AYoung Harry was quite taken with both “The Nice Doctor Mr. John” and “The Cookie Lady Maggie” which made explaining what was going to happen easier than it would’ve been otherwise though the only one of the Holmes men he’d relaxed around even a little was Sherlock, due no doubt to his being abused mostly by a man and Sherlock’s uncharacteristic gentleness with the injured boy.AMinutes before their departure through the floo, Lord Wallace meeting the Holmes party at the bank along with Siger’s brother Sherrinford or as Sherlock put it “the other Lord Holmes”, John crouched down next to the chair that held the stubbornly-upright Harry.A“Do you remember what we talked about, Harry?”  He probed gently as he reached out and took one delicate hand in his – checking the child’s pulse while he was at it.  Doctor-habits being hard for him to shake.AHarry nodded solemnly.  He’d been told a lot of things since waking up in the hospital, many he wasn’t sure that he believed just yet.  But he was clean, and fed, and had his own bed to sleep in with blankets on it.  And no one had hurt him, beyond what they had to so he could use the bathroom and other necessities.ALittle things to most people that meant the old to Harry.A“What did we talk about?”  John prodded for a verbal answer, something the little one had obviously been trained not to give.  His caretakers must have preferred him silent as well as broken.  Until they broke him too well and he wound up in John’s care.AHonestly, as harsh as it might sound, that was probably the best thing they ever could’ve done for him.A“Hang on tight.”  Harry repeated dutifully though still being as quiet as he could manage and be heard.  “Close my eyes and hold my breath.  Be polite to the goblins at the bank.  Wait until we’re home to ask questions.”AThe existence of goblins – complete with moving pictures in the book Mr. Holmes the eldest showed him – was a revelation to Harry, doing more to damage the hold the Dursleys had on him than any amount of tender-loving-care could have.  Goblins flew in the face of everything Mr. and Mrs. Dursley had pounded into his head about what was “normal” and “real”.  Plus Dr. John hadn’t lied to him yet, even when he said things would hurt he didn’t lie to make Harry feel better.A“Good lad.”  John praised, gently rubbing one hand against Harry’s stubbled head.  They’d had to shave it to piece a portion of his skull together.  A blood miracle of the child’s magic that he had survived.  A less powerful boy wouldn’t have and a mundane child would’ve been dead long before the final beating.AHarry beamed up at him at the praise and then lifted his arms – slowly as he’d learned it hurt less – for John to pick him up and take him through the fire-floo.AHe’d never been called a good lad before.A…AWhen the head of the Potter Accounts at Gringotts received the request for a private meeting using the correct form, manners, and form of address from a wizard needless to say Goblin Account Manager Ragnok was surprised.  The last communication regarding the accounts under his management was from that creature Dumbledore setting up the maintainence payments to Heir Potter’s guardians.  A surprise – because all goblins from the oldest to the smallest goblick knew that certain Heirs were raised by their Stewards not some magicless relation – but not something Gringotts could interfere with without the Heir challenging it.AThough they were able to stop Dumbledore from accessing any and all of the accounts of the latest crop of war orphans.  It was the least they could do and all they could do.  Goblins may not like humans in general and despise many wizards and witches in particular but even they don’t prey on the innocent like the Chief Warlock was attempting.  A disgrace to magical kind was that upstart.ARagnok was nonetheless confused over the meeting request.  Heir Potter was supposedly hidden away where not even his bound House Elves could find him.  And without him there was nothing Ragnok nor Steward Wallace could do.AWhich explained why he was stunned – though he was an old enough goblin that he could keep it from showing – when the group making its way from the floo room parted upon crossing the wards of the securest meeting room Gringotts boasted.AAll goblins to become Account Managers had to learn a form of mage-sight that allowed them to read both power-levels of magical creatures as well as their magical signatures.  A necessity to prevent fraud and the most heinous of crimes in the goblin nation – theft.  Polyjuice and glamours could copy a person’s appearance – but not their magical signature.  And rituals that could copy someone’s magical signature weren’t able to mask their power levels.AIt was like muggle finger-printing combined with DNA analysis – simply impossible to beat but it only took a glance.AAnd Ragnok most certainly remembered the magical imprint of the child being held by no less than a muggle.A“Well.”  He gave a sharp-toothed grin at the gathered assemblage.  “Perhaps this won’t be a waste of my time after all.”A…AOnce everyone was seated, Gawain got right to the point – something everyone including not just Ragnok and Harry appreciated.A“We need to confirm myself as Heir Potter’s legal and magical guardian.”  He stated bluntly as Ragnok watched with cunning eyes.  “And then have all the paperwork filed and immediately either sealed or buried.”ASo nobody could interfere again, was thought by all but the child in question.A“Hmm.”  Ragnok thought furiously for a moment.  “This is no easy matter, Lord Wallace.”  He said reprovingly.  “With the Potter Wills sealed and the Lordship Ring retuned to the House Vault until the Heir is eligible to claim it at eleven there is no simple answer.  Especially with Dumbledore and the Ministry’s heavy-handed fumbling.”A“Understood.”  Sherrinford nodded sharply.  He’d only just met the boy but he could see why his brother and nephews were so attached.  “But easy doesn’t matter in this case, merely thoroughness and speed.”A“There is a way.”  Ragnok admitted after several long moments.  “Besides simply absconding with the Heir until he’s eleven anyway.”ASmirks all around on the Holmes’s faces showed their goblin audience that they’d clearly accepted that kidnapping was still on the table.A“Lord Wallace however is unlikely to like it.”A“Why?”  Gawain asked, dread filling his mind.A“Because it is Blood Magick.”  Ragnok’s smile was all teeth.  “Olde Blood Magicks.  And the Goblin Nation is well aware of your personal feelings about such things.”ASherrinford manfully held in a snicker.  That was an understatement.  The entire British magical world knew how Gawain Wallace felt about Blood Magick – one of the three branches of Necromancy – after all it cost him his first wife who was a practitioner who overreached herself during a ritual.AThe then-Heir Wallace led a campaign to have Blood Magick outlawed, sending it into the ranks of its Darker two brethren Soul Magick and Animation.  He succeed to some extent though not completely.  Blood Magick was still used by goblins and other magical creatures and witches and wizards could still learn and practice it – though only during a Master Apprenticeship either in Warding, Ritual Magic, or the Dark Arts.  Even with the stigma of being “Dark” the Lords wouldn’t allow such a potentially useful branch of magic be out of their reach.A“Which ritual?”  Siger asked, cutting off the burgeoning argument between his Darker brother and the Lighter Wallace.A“The Ritual of Blood Inheritance.”  Ragnok supplied.  “It will show the young Heir’s complete magical lineage – both Blood and Blood-Adopted – and all Inheritances.  It’s the only iron-clad way to remove Heir Potter from his present situation and place him with the appropriate Steward.”A“Sounds perfect for our needs.”  Sherrinford said, resolutely keeping his eyes on the goblin rather than on the fellow Lord to his right who was clenching his jaw so tightly he could swear he heard his molars grind.  “Are there any caveats?”AAn excellent question when dealing with Olde Magicks, especially ones using Blood.A“Of course there are.”  Gawain bit out.  He’d researched many of the ways to fix his future Lord’s situation and had come across the Ritual in question.  “He’ll be automatically bound to any existing contracts – be they Courtship, Betrothal, or Marriage – for any Line or House he ends up Inheriting through the Ritual.  He’ll have to be confirmed as the Heir on the next Power Day and then Claim those same Lines or Houses on his eleventh birthday.”A“He will also have to abide by the results of the Ritual.”  Ragnok added when Lord Wallace couldn’t bring himself to continue.A“What do you mean?”  John asked.  Most of the discussion was over his head but even he could see that the goblin was hedging.AThe others looked around at each other in confusion.  What more could there be to it than they’ve already discussed.  Leave it to Sherlock to “deduce” the answer.A“Plural.”  Sherlock looked up from staring at his steepled hands.  “They both used the plural several times.  Contracts, Lines, Houses, Results.  Both of them – the Potter Account Manager and the Potter Steward – are inferring that young Harry could inherit more than one House, Lordship, etcetera.”A“Very good, Mr. Holmes.”  Ragnok commented.  “I’d heard you were excellent at seeing what others miss.  I’m glad to know it wasn’t an exaggeration as humans are know for.”A“Please don’t compliment him.”  John grumbled quietly – causing the sleepy Harry to giggle.  “He’ll be insufferable for days.”A“Is it possible, Gawain?”  Siger asked with a familiarity his brother wouldn’t deign to use.  The two of them were too staunchly on opposite political parties for that.  Siger as a mostly-mundane political force could appeal to his old classmate on a much more even footing.A“Possible?”  Gawain blew out a breath and shrugged.  “Entirely.  The Potters, according to the documents I’ve seen in my and my family’s tenure as Potter Steward, are a magical Family dating back to before Christ.  They pre-date Merlin and the Founders.  They could be related and interrelated to hundreds if not thousands of magical and mundane families.  Whether the relation is enough for Heir Potter to Claim an Inheritance?”  He held up a hand, making a so-so motion.  “It’s hazy.  Impossible to predict.  Even for your talented son.”  He added the last as he caught sight of Mycroft staring into the distance.ALord Wallace had been around long enough to recognize when someone was Seeing something he could not – even if they weren’t a Seer per se.A“He’s right.”  Mycroft admitted with a telling grimace.  “Ever since Goblin Ragnok mentioned the Ritual the future’s gone blurry on me.  I’m useless at the moment.”A“Surprise is good for the soul.”  His mother soothed as the others devolved into a minor debate over the Ritual – and it’s possible outcomes.A“But bad for the economy.”  Mycroft retorted good-humoredly as Ragnok brought the meeting back under control.A“As interesting as your points all are, gentleman.”  Ragnok held up a hand in a silencing motion.  Part of him hated to do so.  He enjoyed a good blood-pumping debate as the next goblin and these wizards were excellent at it.  Probably helped along by them actually understanding and applying logic to their arguments, unlike the majority of their kind.  “It is all moot.  The only one who can agree to the Ritual is Heir Potter himself.  Otherwise it’ll be deadly.  And not just to him.  So.”  He turned his age-wrinkled face towards the little one who’d spent much of the visit snoozing off and on until the Lords Wallace and Holmes started bickering like goblicks.  “What questions do you have, young Potter?”AHarry was smart for his age.  Something that had never failed to infuriate Mrs. Dursley but that made Dr. John and his Sherlock beam at him whenever he understood something they thought beyond him.  But even a very-smart four year old would have trouble with the current discussion.  Especially since it was mostly about magic – a forbidden subject at this old house.ASo he asked the pertinent – to him – question.A“Will I have to go back to the Dursley’s if I do it?”  Though what “it” was he still wasn’t quite sure.  He’d never heard the word “ritual” before.  Unfortunately he understood “blood” all too well.A“No.”  Ragnok answered simply.A“Will it hurt?”A“It shouldn’t.”AHarry nodded accepting that it might, which led to his next and last question.A“Will it hurt more than when Mrs. Dursley poured the bacon grease on my arm?”AIt was only through pure force of will that the gathered wizards, goblin, and witch didn’t pop away immediately at that innocently-voiced query.  All the adults shared a glance over his head.  Someday the Dursleys would pay for that question in blood.A“No, Harry.”  John answered, seeing the question worried his charge more and more the longer the others took to contain themselves enough to respond.  “None of us would ever ask you to do anything that hurt that much.  Let alone more than that.  Do you understand?  Not ever.”AGrinning up at the nice Dr. John, Harry bounced a little before settling back against his warm chest.  The brief period of activity cost him.A“Okay.”  He agreed easily, worries removed.  “I’ll do the rit-ual.”A…AWith the needed permission, Ragnok immediately sent off alerts to the needed goblins to prepare the ritual room – and to have a goblin Healer on standby.  At the moment there was nothing they could do to Heal the child’s injuries – which he’d needed a catalog of before the ritual in case he’d been given something that would conflict with it.  He hadn’t been but until Lord Wallace was confirmed as his Steward and therefore guardian, the wizard couldn’t authorize a Healing.AUnfortunate because all the metal in Heir Potter’s body could be removed and the bones Healed in a matter of moments using a metal-inclined goblin Healer.  Even a wizarding Healer would take a week or more to do the same.  When they were finished he would still need to be under a Healer’s direct care for weeks if not years to stop and correct the damage done to his young body.ANot to mention Mind Healing from the abuse and torment he’d suffered.ARagnok longed to soak his axe-blade in Dursley blood but like all the rest understood the need to wait.AThe Ritual was simplicity in itself as all the best rituals were.  Any witch or wizard with a modicum of understanding of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and some form of the so-called “Dark Arts” could create a Ritual.  What sets apart a Mastery-level Ritual from just a ritual was two things: cost and consistency.AWith a strong enough will and a surplus of magical power, anyone could do anything…at least once.  Accidental magic was an excellent example of this.  A true Ritual will consistently do the same thing no matter how many times you repeat it – as long as you repeat it correctly of course.ACost is another matter entirely.  Like-for-like is the general rule of magic usage.  Small effect, small cost.  Big effect, big cost.  It was why most average wizards and witches couldn’t do magic on the same scale as the most powerful ones.  They simply didn’t have the power reserves to pay the price.  To know the laws of magic and to successfully utilize Runes and Arithmancy to power a Ritual to complete seemingly impossible magic was the mark of a Master.AIf they used another – untried and tested – ritual to confirm Heir Potter’s inheritance it would likely cost every drop of blood in the child’s body as it attempted to trace his heritage.AThis Ritual only needed seven drops.AThe Ritual Room deep within the heart of Gringotts was the only space large enough for the Ritual of Blood Inheritance to take place.  As it traced one’s entire magical heritage, for a Family as old as the Potters they needed a lot of space and one very, very large blank tapestry.  A nice side benefit of the Ritual was once it was done there was no reason to repeat it.  The tapestry would be taken down to a special Vault that was opened specifically to hold it and would self-update every time someone was born or adopted of Heir Potter’s Blood.AIf he was muggle-born they could’ve done it right in Ragnok’s office since it wouldn’t need to reach back two millennia or more to trace his magical Line.AThankfully they wouldn’t need to inspect every inch of the tapestry – although he was certain there were some goblin historians that would approach Heir Potter for permission to – a special parchment and quill were linked to the tapestry and would record any valid Inheritances.AWhich was the goal of this whole event in the first place.A“We’re ready for you.”  Ragnok called to the child and his muggle minder once he was given the signal from the Gringotts Ritual Master.AJohn immediately left the group of observing humans who were intensely cataloguing every movement of the gathered goblins and carried his charge over to the goblin-height table.  Kneeling down, he rested Harry on his bent knee, steading him with an arm around his waist.  He still didn’t like the look of the curved dagger that Ragnok was holding…A“Seven drops.”  Ragnok reminded them – more for the wary adult than the curious child.  “Then we shall see what you’re made of, young Potter.”AHarry nodded solemnly and held out a steady hand over the prepared bowl of potion swirling in a mixture of opalescent-white and gleaming-gold as he’d been quickly taught by Lord Wallace.ARagnok nodded in fierce approval of the youngling’s lack of fear.  They’d make a warrior of him yet.  Fitting for the Potter Heir.  If there ever was a Family that goblins approved of it was the former Generals of the Pendragon Dynasty.AAs gently as he could, the goblin pierced the child’s left hand just below his thumb and allowed the required seven drops to flow into the Ritual bowl.  Once the last drop fell, the potion flashed red and the cut healed without a mark – appeasing the doctor in John.  The potion swirled and flashed – as if the colors were fighting amongst themselves – then a bolt of pure magic exploded from the bowl and hit the tapestry.  What was left of the potion was sucked up by the prepared quill as it quickly marked the parchment.ANo one was paying the quill any mind as color bled from that bolt of magic that hit the tapestry dead-center.  Color and words – names – flowed and swirled across the blank surface, leaving human and goblin alike in awe.  Before long, seven names shone with fierce golden light the only others that could compete with them were four in bright silver, one in unrepentant black, and the last in sapphire blue.A“Merlin and Morgana.”  Sherrinford breathed.A“What is it?”  Sherlock prompted his uncle, the rest were too busy goggling at the ostentatious displace of power.  Sherrinford had among other achievements a Master in History of Magic and was better prepared than anyone else for what might be revealed.A“Gold.”  He nearly stuttered.  “It’s gold.”A“Yes, Uncle.”  Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Very observant.”ASherrinford reached over and popped his impudent nephew on the back of his head at his patronizing tone.A“Let me repeat myself.”  He said sternly.  “There are seven gold names on that tapestry.”AThe other Lord woke enough from his stupor to catch onto what has the perpetual thorn-in-his-side shocked nearly out of his wits and was likely the cause for the sudden flurry of activity among the goblins.A“What is the significance of gold lettering, Uncle Sherrinford?”  Mycroft asked the question that his little brother was too-busy pouting to voice.A“Gold.”  King Ragnarok of the Goblin Hoard answered from the now-open doorway through which he’d entered after a furious summons from his Ritual Master.  “Is the color of the seven Royal Houses.  It’s the colors of the Seven Houses and Kingdoms of Avalon.”AYou could’ve heard a pin-drop in the utter silence that followed that pronouncement.A“Oh.”  John said eloquently into the quiet, before looking down into worried-green eyes.  “We’re going to have to get you some new…everything…little one.”A“Indeed.”  Mycroft rolled his eyes in an unconscious echo of his brother’s earlier faux-pas with their uncle.A…AAfter King Ragnarok’s startling announcement, the humans and Ragnok along with his King, moved into the safety and relative comfort of the meeting room and tea was provided to steady the humans’ nerves.  The Goblin King had already given orders to have the tapestry secured in their highest-security Vault deep within the caverns below the bank and gave a blanket gag-order to all of the goblin personnel present for the Ritual.  Not a breath of the events in that chamber would reach the outside world via a goblin.AEverything else was up to the humans and not their concern.ASnapping his fingers, Ragnarok wordlessly demanded the Ritual Parchment from the Potter Account Manager.  Ragnok was an excellent goblin and very trustworthy.  There were no concerns there, even if he wasn’t his son.AAnother snap of his fingers had a listing of the now-applicable binding contracts the Heir would be subject to once he Claimed his Inheritance.  As he was now required to according to the terms of the Ritual.ASeeing that the humans were once again capable of rational thought, the King began.A“According to the Ritual of Inheritance,” his voice was like two boulders grinding together but still somehow commanding.  “Heir Potter – confirmed, is the Heir of Emrys, Pendragon, Gryffindor, Peverell, Potter – confirmed, and Valerius through his Patriarchal Line.  He is also the Heir of LeFey, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Pevensie, and Evans – confirmed, through his Matriarchal Line.  He is Heir of Slytherin – confirmed, by Right of Conquest and Heir Black by Right of Blood Adoption.”AGawain buried his head in his hands with a groan having been counting as the Houses were read off.A“Thirteen.”  Siger shared a concerned look with his brother.  He knew what was troubling Gawain – and it had nothing to do with that bit about Conquest and Adoption.  “Thirteen Houses.  By Antioch’s cursed Wand…thirteen lines he’s now bound to continue.”A“Godric’s Sword.”  Gawain cursed himself as he pinched his nose between his fingers.  “Give us the rest of it.  With seven Royal Houses and another six of various nobility there has to be more bad news.  For one I can’t be the only Steward which muddies up the whole guardianship issue.”A“Quite,” Ragnarok perused the files before him for a moment, obviously comparing information before giving them a summation of the size of the clusterfuck they’re dealing with.  “Along with yourself Lord Wallace, the other possible guardians are Dowager Augusta Longbottom – ineligible due to guardianship of another Heir, Heir Eddard Ollivander, Lord Arcturus Black – ineligible due to infirmity, Lords Siger or Sherrinford Holmes – both eligible, Lady Amelia Bones – ineligible due to Vows of Office, Lord Severus Snape-Prince – ineligible due to Vow of Fealty to Lord Slytherin, now young Harry among other Vows which could conflict with his guardianship, and finally Lord Tiberious Nott – ineligible, serving life-sentence in Azkaban.”A“So other than the three in this room.”  Sherlock summed up.  “The only possible guardian that is eligible would be this Eddard Ollivander.”A“I know him.”  His uncle said after a moment.  “So does Lord Wallace.  He of an age with Mycroft, maybe the generation older.  More importantly he’s the Headmaster of the Hedwig Institute of Magic, a private school for pre-Hogwarts education.  For those who can afford it.”AGawain nodded, placing the name with a face.  “It’s an excellent school.  I’ve already reserved places for David and Rhys when they reach eleven.”  His sons.A“Regardless.”  Ragnok broke in before his King lost his patience with the pointless discussion.  “As there are three out of four possible guardians present if you all come to an agreement now and create a contract accordingly there wouldn’t be anything Headmaster Ollivander could do about it even if he found out before Heir…Harry,” he decided for expedience.  “Claimed his Lordships at eleven.”AMycroft smirked.  “Majority rules.”A“Exactly.”  Ragnok nodded.A“Before you begin hashing out a guardianship contract.”  Ragnarok set aside the files as he came to a conclusion.  “There is another issue.”A“How bad?”  Gawain asked, closing his eyes.  This was the other-shoe-dropping that he’d been waiting for.  He’d noted the color of the files the Goblin King had been comparing.  They were the binding contracts they’d talked about earlier.A“It could be worse.”  The King answered dryly.  “Young Harry will be the subject of a mere six binding magical contracts upon being confirmed Heir on the Equinox next month.”AHarry had been found mere days after his fourth birthday and brought to John’s clinic.A“However he won’t have to actually start fulfilling them until the various Lordships are conferred upon him when he turns eleven.”A“That’s not that bad.”  Margeux spoke up with a shrug.  “Unless some of them are from the far-distant past, they most likely won’t come into play until he’s at least reached the normal age of magical majority.”A“What types and with who?”  Sherrinford asked succinctly.  “We might need to start preparing for possible political suicide depending on the contract in question, despite your glass-half-full outlook Margeux.”ARagnarok ran a hoary finger down the list, reading them off as he went:A“Marriage Contract: House Slytherin and House Ptolemy, must be fulfilled by his sixteenth birthday.  Marriage Contract: House LeFey and the House of the Rising Sun, must be fulfilled by his sixteenth birthday.  Marriage Contract: House Emrys and House Nimue, in abeyance unless Heir of Nimue Claims Inheritance, if so, must be fulfilled before his coronation as King of Avalon at age thirteen.  Marriage Contract: House of Ravenclaw and House of Prince, must be fulfilled by his fifteenth birthday.  Betrothal Contract: House Valerius and House duLac, must be fulfilled by his eighteenth birthday.  Betrothal Contract: House of Pevensie,” looking up he smirked at Gawain.  “And the House of Wallace.”AJohn could barely hear the goblin’s final words over the groan from Lord Wallace and the gasps from everyone else.A“Must be fulfilled by his eighteenth birthday.”  Still smirking the Goblin King rose waving them all back into their seats as they attempted to show him the respect due a King.  “I hope for your sons’ sakes that one of them turns out to be…flexible.”AWith that snarky comment the Kind strode from the room after waving goodbye to the sleepy boy still cuddled up in his protector’s arms.AIt seems those big green eyes could melt even the fiercest of stony hearts.AFlopping back into his chair, Gawain stared up at the ceiling with unseeing eyes.A“Giovanna is going to kill me.”  He whispered.A“How is your temperamental Italian bride?”  Sherrinford mercilessly rubbed in his rival’s imminent tongue-lashing.  “Thrown any pottery at you lately?”A“Boys.”  Margeux cut the fight off before it could gain traction.  “Shall we concentrate on our original purpose and leave the matchmaking for another day?”  Or year.A“Excellent suggestion, Lady Holmes.”  Ragnok said wryly, weary himself from the day’s revelations.  Taking out a fresh quill he nodded, ready for them to inform him of their desired guardianship agreement.A“Since my parents are the only option without children still at home.”  Mycroft was the first to speak.  “I suggest they have full physical custody of young Harry with legal and magical custody split three ways between my father, uncle, and Lord Wallace.”ASherrinford nodded slowly, seeing the many benefits of the plan.A“Margeux as I recall as a degree in elementary education, like many college-educated Ladies.”  He commented.  “Perfect for teaching Harry what he needs for a mundane education whilst the rest of us see to his specialized education: Governing, Foreign Relations, Languages…”  He offered speaking for himself.  “I could also help with Runes, Arithmancy, History of Magic, and Herbology when the time comes.”A“Chemistry.”  Sherlock called the subject – not that anyone else really wanted it.  “And deduction, combat skills if needed.”AJohn sighed.  “I could teach him sharpshooting if we’re going that route.  Literature and first-aid/triage as well.”A“As his Steward,” Lord Wallace frowned minutely.  “I’m to teach him Estate Management, though I suppose on a much grander scale now than it was supposed to be.  Fencing as well.  Basic Potions.”  He wasn’t in Lord Prince’s caliber of Potioneers but then almost no one was.A“Music.”  Margeux said in the same no-nonsense manner she’d used on her boys when they were young.  “He’ll need Deportment and Manners lessons as well.”AStudying the parchment he’d asked Ragnok for, Mycroft arched a brow.  He’d just found an answer to the Healer problem.A“You’re all forgetting some key subjects as well as specialized ones.”  He pointed out before tucking his copy of the parchment away in his hidden pocket.  He had a visit to make while the others settled Harry into Ravenscroft or returned home.  “But for now I suggest a standard guardianship contract for an Heir with the original phrasing I provided.  The poor lad is probably insensate from exhaustion and hunger.”AMycroft expertly twisted the knife, fielding looks from his father and brother.  They both knew he was up to something but not what.  And that was all that mattered.ASigning completed courtesy of a Blood Quill and binding magical contract filed, the Holmes’s minus Sherrinford and Mycroft left for Ravenscroft with John and Harry in tow while Lord Wallace made arrangements for the mountainous array of files to be sent to the secured lockbox in his home office.  It was only a fraction of what he would have to slog through after Harry was confirmed as Heir to the rest of his Inheritance but better to complete it early than to add it to the upcoming morass.  He shuddered thinking of the state the accounts for the Avalon Seven must be in after being thought lost for so long.AIt was enough to give a Steward hives.A…AMeanwhile, Mycroft had taken advantage of his temporary use of the Gringotts floo system and departed for a magical hotel in a well-known mundane tourist attraction – mainly due to the massive water serpent that simply refused to keep her head beneath the water.  “Nessie” was one of the single biggest Statute of Secrecy violations the Obliviators had to deal with.  Sometimes hourly.AThe reason the urbane Mycroft was about to soil his thousand-dollar plus outfit in the wilds of Scotland was simple:ABefore The Blacks were Blacks, they were Dubhs.  And before that they were likely some ancient dialect that translates to Black.  However the Dubhs once made themselves a reputation for ferocity by fighting off invaders in remote Scotland – at the heart of which now stood the ancient and impressive Castle Black.AHome to the Black Lord and the House Seat, Castle Black was built solely to instill awe and fear in its enemies and to be an impenetrable fortress to protect the wild Family and their loved ones.AHowever, Castle Black was finicky as some ancient magical buildings could be, and to be a true Lord Black the Castle had to accept you.  Once done, it was rare for a Lord to leave for any significant period of time.  Meaning if you had business with Lord Black you came to him.AOnly for his King would a Black Lord – and it was always a Lord never a Lady – willingly leave Castle Black behind for more than a day or two.AIt was therefore unfortunately for Mycroft’s ensemble that he had business with Lord Black.ABusiness that he would never undertake if it wasn’t for his twin gifts of insight and mild foresight.  For nothing less than the future safety of Britain would Mycroft willingly deal with the irascible Lord Black.AThough the safety and happiness of a green-eyed waif was quickly joining that rank.AScratching his request on the back of his card, he sent it to wherever within his wards Lord Black might be as he accepted a cup of tea from the hotel’s proprietress.ANot five minutes passed before a House Elf wearing a pillow sham adorned with the Black Crest appeared at his side.A“Jack-Jack is to be taking the impertinent Mr. Holmes to sees the great Lord Black.”  The elf squeaked holding out one gangly hand.AHe let out a smirk at the “impertinent” remark before blotting his mouth precisely with his napkin and leaving a galleon on the table.  Taking the elf’s hand once he’d stood, Mycroft nodded in assent.  Rather than being sucked through a straw, house elves simply “popped” from one place to another, leaving their rare passengers with a disorienting sense of being misplaced in space and time.  Still, it was much more pleasant than most forms of magical transport.ADropping the elf’s hand he nodded to it – him – politely in thanks then turned to look at the indomitable Lord Arcturus Black.ASeated with Lordly sternness behind a massive ebony desk, Arcturus Black had hair long gone white from age.   His once-elegant hands were covered in paper-thin and spotted skin where they were folded upon the leather desk blotter.  He wore clothes that were fine both in tailoring and materials – but that harked back to another era.  All-in-all Lord Arcturus Black looked every decade of his nearly two centuries of life.AGrief had taken it’s toll on him, Mycroft’s keen eye saw.  It was there in the barely-curved line of shoulder, the weight of the gaze that spoke of soul-deep tiredness.  Here was a man, a Lord, that had outlived his spouse, all his children, all his grandchildren, more than one of his great-grandchildren, and lost his youngest double-great as well as another to Voldemort along with his brother and cousin to Azkaban.  He’d disowned only one member of House Black in all that time, for all that his rather-mad great-granddaughter Walburga liked to blast people off the Family Tree at Grimmauld Place.AHer feelings for her mother aside, Andromeda did require his permission to marry and lost her right to the Black name and Inheritance the moment she eloped rather than risk him denying his blessing.AIt was the disrespect of it that rankled him far more than her choice of spouse.AAt least Ted Tonks made something of himself.  It was more than he could saw for her sister and her husband and brother-in-law now cozily ensconced and keeping company with Dementors.A“What brings you to my door, young Holmes?”  Lord Black asked in an aged-cracked whisper.  “Surely there’s not a Black left capable or willing to cause trouble in your domain?”AMycroft had to chuckle at that.  Something told him that once-upon-a-time Arcturus Black had received a number of visits from his predecessors.  Blacks simply had a talent for finding trouble.A“Nothing of that sort.”  Mycroft took the chair offered him and removed the parchment Ragnok had copied for him from his pocket.  “Rather I’m here about business under your domain.”A“Are you?”  Arcturus hummed under his breath once his Ring remained dormant.  Whatever the parchment was it wasn’t dangerous to him in anyway.AThe younger man nodded.  “Second line from the bottom.”AStorm-grey eyes widened a fraction before all emotion was wiped from his craggy face.  Quickly scanning the rest of the page, he set it aside after several long moments.  Tapping one long finger on the compelling document, Arcturus locked gazes with the young statesman before him.AIt was auspicious news indeed, news with the potential to raise the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black from the mud and mire it had fallen into with the choices his youngest descendants have made.AHand-in-hand with that potential walked disaster.AIf this young child – a mere four years old! – wasn’t raised properly or had the wrong temperament, confirming his place in the House of Black could be the worst thing he could possibly do.  It was a gamble…A“No risk.”  Mycroft said softly, as if reading the Lord Black’s mind.  “No reward.”A“Quite so.”  Arcturus laughed dryly.  “Quite so.  Tell me, what exactly is it you want of me?”ALeaning forward, Mycroft explained his plan.",The Avalon

a republic with his foster father Siger Holmes, Sirius Black felt a moment of disquiet.AFrowning deeply he met the golden gaze of his mate and called him from the study with a glance.AOut in the hall, Remus wrapped his arms around the lanky body he knew as well as his own hugging him tightly.  Resting his cheek on the top of Sirius’s ebony man, he asked.A“What’s wrong, love?”A“Did we do the right thing?”  Sirius tilted his head back and looked up into the honey-brown eyes that had a hint of gold tinging them.  Both Remus and Moony were listening.  “Not contesting the guardianship.”  He explained.  “Going along with the Holmes’s plan.  Letting Gawain be Harry’s second father.”  He snorted, rolling his eyes.  “Allowing my great-great-great,” he flung out a hand.  “Whatever-grandfather school him in Lordships and Rituals and being a Black of House Black.  He’s just a child.”  Sirius’s normally barking voice was more of a whimper as he finished.  “Just a child.  Seven years old.  A Second-grader in the States.  And he can debate the values of various forms of government with a man who used to be a government.”ARemus hugged him tighter rocking him back and forth to soothe him.A“That’s not the childhood James and Lily would’ve wanted for Prongslet.”AHis mate had to concede to that.A“No.”  Remus admitted in his smooth growl.  “It’s not.  But listen to me lover.”  Stormy eyes locked on his face.  “No one could’ve anticipated that Harry would be who he is.  No one, Pads.  Not even Lily.”ASirius choked out a laugh at that.  Knowing Lily he wasn’t so sure.A“You’re right.  If James and Lily had lived, Harry would’ve been the Heir Potter-Black.  He would’ve had a normal Heir’s education and been friends with all of the Order children.  And probably would’ve married little Ginevra Weasley with the notorious Potter attraction for redheads.”ABoth of them chuckled over that.  After Sirius’s innocence meant that they were able to reconnect with many of the former Order members – many of which now had children.  Some like Molly Weasley resisted spending too much time with them after their public break with Dumbledore.  However they’d still been introduced to her children through Nymphadora…needless to say they weren’t impressed with the lazy Ronald and entitled Ginevra.A“But they did die.”  Sirius said brokenly, knowing already what point his mate was going to make.  “And Harry’s lineage was revealed to protect him.  I know Remy.  It just twists me around when I see him acting like a little adult instead of a kid.”A“Unfortunately,” Remus sighed, turning them and escorting him to their room at Ravenscroft Hill.  “Hadrian can’t afford to be just a kid.  He’s” Remus chuckled knowing pureblooded Sirius wouldn’t know the quote.  “The Once and Future King.  While giving him a childhood is important it’s equally important that he be ready to rule.  Magic wouldn’t have put this on his shoulders if he wasn’t capable or worthy.  Have faith in our cub, Pads.  He’ll be okay.”A“I suppose you’re right.”  Sirius sighed then smirked.  “You always are, Mr. Prefect.”A“Git.”A…A“Mother.”  Prince Charles was the last of the requested royals to arrive.  He strode to her side and bussed her cheek before joining his lovely wife on the settee.  This being a summons to part of the “family” section of the Palace, no formality was needed or wanted between them.ACharles nodded to his father Philip and wound an arm around Diana’s shoulders before giving over his attention to the man who ran the government – and who hopefully still would be by the time Charles took the throne.  The House of Windsor – formerly the House of Saxe-Coburn-Gothe – had always relied on the Holmes men to keep the wheels of the government churning along.  A duty they were simply superb at seeing through to the bitter end.A“Now what’s all this about?”  He asked, directing his question correctly towards Mycroft.A“It seems.”  The Queen spoke firmly with no trace of her earlier disquiet present anywhere in her demeanor.  “That Our grandson William is a Wizard.”AScoffing Charles rolled his eyes and made to stand.A“Don’t be ridiculous.”  He chided his mother forgetting for a moment that she was also his reigning Monarch.  “There’s no such thing as magic.”A“Actually, Charles.”  Diana spoke in a barely-audible whisper looking up from her tightly clenched hands.  “That’s not precisely true.”APrince Charles looked from one woman in his life to the other, searching for some sign that this was all a hoax.  Turning to the other males for some type of masculine solidarity he found himself wanting.ASeeing that neither woman was inclined to explain, Mycroft took over.A“Alongside what you would term ‘normal’ society, Charles.”  Mycroft said crisply, none of his familiarity with the Queen present in his tone.  “Runs another society.  Magical society.  They would call your so-called normal people the “mundane” or the more patronizing “muggle” people.  Non-magical.  Not even capable of seeing most magic let alone using it.  Before These Islands were fought over by Northmen and Saxons and Romans, a rich magical people, a magical kingdom flourished.  And while it’s not nearly as robust as it once was, it is still there to this day.  So I’m afraid that your assertion that there is no such thing as magic isn’t even close to the truth.”ALeaning back heavily in shock, Charles stared off at nothing.  Realizing an opening was at hand Philip asked a rather pertinent question.A“I know why my Elizabeth is aware of magic.”  He said frowning.  “She was told by her father before he passed and then told me upon our marriage.  But Diana,” he turned towards his daughter-in-law.  “Why and how do you know?”A“I…”  She sighed, laying her hands flat on her thighs and pressing down gently.  “It’s a family story passed down.  That Sarah Jenyns who married my ancestor the first Duke of Marlborough wasn’t the daughter of Frances Thornhurst at all but from another Line entirely.  A magical one.  She supposedly couldn’t do magic herself but she made salves and tonics that worked better than any medicine of the time.  That there was simply something about her that made her a confidant and trusted friend of those who knew her.  But it was just a story, no one from our family has ever had magic.”A“Do you have any idea which magical Line?”  Mycroft asked pointedly.A“None.”  Diana waved a graceful hand.  “She was obviously noble-born but other than that there were only rumors and whispers like those that followed many of the early great women.”A“Yes, yes.”  Charles broke in now that he’d wrapped his head around magic of all things.  “But what it to be done now that we have an apparently magical Heir to the Throne on our hands?”A“Mycroft?”  The Queen prompted.A“He has to be trained of that there can be no question.”  The British Government insisted.  “Now that he’s proven his ability and found his magic it will want to be used.  And if he doesn’t learn to control it…”  He trailed off, the others clearly taking his point.  “The first thing that should be done at this juncture, for everyone involved,” he looked meaningfully at the Queen, alluding to their previous conversation.  “Is for the magical security force here to take an Unbreakable Vow regarding Prince William’s magical status until he officially enters the magical world.  Afterwards we need to seek out the Ritual Master at Gringotts Bank to confirm William’s magical heritage.  At that point I will be able to best advise you regarding the young Prince’s magical schooling.”AThe four Royals exchanged glances.  However no matter what Charles and Diana liked to tell themselves, this was a decision that was going to be made not by the Royal Family but by the Queen for the good of the realm.A“Very well.”  Elizabeth nodded with a serene air.  Philip immediately was on the phone calling in the magical members of the security forces.AWhile they waited for them all to arrive Mycroft asked who would be accompanying him and the Prince to the Wizarding World.A“His grandfather would be best, I believe.”  The Queen decided nodding towards her husband.  “He has mostly the same information as We do and unlike my son and daughter-in-law, no obligations on his time.”ATaking that as a dismissal, Diana and Charles took their leave to make ready for the black-tie charity event they were to attend that evening.  Diana broke off from her husband, seeking out her older son to send him to his grandparents for his coming audience.AAltogether eight Wizards and two Witches made up the security force surrounding the mundane Royal family split evenly between Aurors and Hit Wizards.  Word had spread through their ranks and those off-duty had arrived from home.  Upon entering the office of the Queen, some were surprised to see Philip there along with the Honorable Mycroft Holmes.AOnly Mycroft’s distant cousin Danford was aware that Mycroft Holmes was actually a member for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Holmes being a relation from his mother’s Hawkins side.AStanding he eyed the gathered force before nodding once sharply, decided on who of this number would become William’s personal guard – a position not unlike Remus Lupin’s own in his father’s household.  Simply without the tutoring requirement and honorary “uncle” status.A“Aurors and Hit Wizards.”  He greeted, placing one hand on the end of his umbrella and drawing his wand – a finely tuned instrument that went along with the title of “British Government” it was the only wand that could take his altered magical core and use it in events such as this – to their discomfort.  “You’ve been gathered because the Realm requires you all to take an Unbreakable Vow in order to continue serving the House of Windsor.”ADanford, the nominal head of the force, stepped forward.  “To what end?”  He questioned his cousin.A“To the safety and continued security of the Realm and Our Family.”  The Queen chided as she rose.ALooks were exchanged all around before each of the ten nodded.  One by one they stepped forward and clasped arms with the Queen as Mycroft served as Bonder.  Each Witch and Wizard agreeing to the Vow Elizabeth and Mycroft had settled on.A“Do you _ hereby Vow to guard the Secrets of the Realm from all others, Magical or Mundane?”A“Will you _ Vow to hold the lives of the Royal Family as dearly as those of your own House?”A“Will you _ Vow to hold as a Secret of the Realm that the member of the Royal Family William Windsor is a Wizard and member of the Magical World and Keep that Secret until he officially enters the Magical World by becoming enrolled at either Hedwig Institute of Magic or Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, whichever occurs last?”AAfter the Vows were made, all but two of the gathered witches and wizards were dismissed, Mycroft having the two he’d tipped for personal guards remain behind.AKingsley Shacklebolt, third son of Lord Shacklebolt of the Ancient and Noble House of Shacklebolt and one of the rising stars of the Auror Department remained as well as Durstram McGonagall, nephew of Lord McGonagall of the Ancient and Noble House of McGonagall and eldest child of Hogwarts’ own Professor Minerva McGonagall, one of the finest Hit Wizards the Academy ever produced.ABetween the two of them Mycroft was assured of both William’s safety but also an ironclad honor that both men were known for which would keep anyone William came into contact with safe.A“From here on out.”  Mycroft stated as the Queen returned to her desk.  “The two of you are the young Prince’s private security force.  If at any time you would like to be reassigned you can come to me and I will take your situation under advisement.”A“Also.”  The Queen added, knowing that for the Vow to engage fully over what was about to be said that She would have to say it.  “From now on anything and everything regarding the Prince, his magical abilities, his associates and friends, his education, everything is considered a Secret of the Realm and will not be made privy to any other besides Ourself and Our Mr. Mycroft Holmes.”A“Which means gentlemen.”  Mycroft tucked his wand back away.  “That you don’t even go to his parents.  You come to me or the Queen.  For now you can decide how you’ll rotate your shifts later, I’ve already had Danford informed of the new assignment.  I need one of you to stay and start duty as the young Prince is expected any moment.”A…AWilliam – Wills to his friends and family – entered his grandmother’s office with trepidation.  Somehow he knew this was about the door that slammed on its own.  Members of the security force had swarmed his bedroom afterwards, reinforcing that he hadn’t just imagined it.AHe’d really made the door slam by looking at it.AAnd now he was in trouble with his grandmother – a position none of her children and grandchildren wanted to occupy.  The Queen could freeze the very blood in your veins with a single look.  And her scoldings left a more last mark than a caning would.ALooking around he spotted not only Grandmother but also Grandfather as well.AHe must really be in for it.AGrandmother’s friend Mr. Holmes was there as well which was odd.  Usually Mr. Holmes only met with Grandmother and usually alone unless his father or someone else was required.  And that funny Mr. McGonagall with his thick brogue was there as well.AMr. McG as he and his little brother Harry called him was one of the first responders after the incident.ACatching the look on her grandson’s face as he approached her desk, Elizabeth chuckled lightly before reassuring him.A“You’re not in trouble, William.”  She told him gently as she waved him to one of the plush chairs at the side of her desk.  “Not in the slightest.”A“What is it then, Grandmother?”  The nearly-eight-year-old asked.  And that nearly was very, very important.A“The other day you made a door slam, is that right?”  She prodded him.A“Yes, Grandmother.”A“How, dear?”AHis lip almost trembled before he remembered his Grandfather and the other men were watching.  His father had been very clear about getting older and crying.A“I don’t know Grandmother.”  He whispered, trying valiantly to keep his head held high.  “I was just frustrated with Harry barging in and then leaving my door open wide when he left that it just…slammed when I looked at it.”A“That young Sir.”  Mr. Holmes said firmly.  “Is called accidental magic and is quite common for young wizards your age.”A“Magic?”  William eyed him skeptically.  “You’re having me on.”A“No, dear.”  Elizabeth shook her head drawing her grandson’s gaze back to herself.  “I’m afraid he’s not.  Magic is real as all of us and now your parents are aware.  You my dear boy have magic in your blood.”A“Magic.”  He breathed, eyes wide as he looked between his grandparents’ faces.  “Real magic?”A“As real as you are young Prince.”  Mr. Holmes nodded.  “Now you,” he pointed at the boy and then gestured between himself and the other men.  “Have an appointment with the magical district so I’m afraid any further question will have to wait until after.  I’m sure once you’ve seen some of what goes on in the magical district you’ll have plenty more that your guards will be happy to answer.”AMr. McG rolled his eyes at Mr. Holmes, Wills spotted it out of the corner of his eyes.A“He means, me an’ Kingsley laddie.”  McG rumbled.  “We’re yer new personal guardsman.  Either of us will be wit’ ya at all times not countin’ sleepin’ and in the loo.”AWills did the only thing he could when face with adults believing in magic and one of them being his Royal Grandmother.  He agreed.A“Okay.”A…AAfter a few quick words between the Royal Couple, the foursome departed for Gringotts – Diagon Alley.AMycroft’s wonderful assistant – today she was a he named Dennis for some reason, Sherlock suspected My’s long hours were making the poor thing have an identity crises – had already informed the Holmes’s Family goblin Hammerhide of their needs and they were ushered right in once Prince Philip and William had recovered from their very first side-along apparation.  Unlike when Mycroft accompanied his now foster-brother, the Windsor Family wasn’t important enough to the goblins to warrant usage of their floo.AThough their royal training was serving them well as Philip manfully ignored the blatant displays of magic in the Alley before they entered the ivory marble edifice and William only paused for a moment at his first sight of a goblin.AThe goblins all easily recognized the dubbed “British Government” as one of the King-Apparent’s foster-brothers and protectors, showing the group an unexpected level of respect as a result, Goblin Griphook ushering them straight to Hammerhide’s office before returning to man the carts.AMcG took up post outside the door as the other entered, being greeted and offered a chair by the waiting Account Manager.A“Gentlemen.”  Hammerhide peered closely at the boy following along behind his older companions.  There was hidden power in that boy.  “How can Gringotts be of assistance today?”A“We need the Ritual of Blood Inheritance performed for young William.”  Mycroft said at once, ignoring the looks from his royal companions.A“And is young William aware of what the Ritual entails?”A“I thought it best if that information was provided by an…unbiased source.”  Mycroft admitted.  “I wouldn’t want Magic to decided I’d tried to sway him in anyway.”A“Wise.”  Hammerhide acknowledged.  “Especially with your connection to the King-Apparent.”AWilliam looked over at the goblin confused at that.  He didn’t have any connection to Mr. Holmes.  Not really.  And if one was going to use that term for an heir to the Throne, it should’ve been towards his father, not him.A“Oh, not you young one.”  The goblin chuckled shaking his head.  “Your Mr. Holmes is the foster-brother of the King-Apparent of the Kingdom of Avalon.  He isn’t quite unbiased when it comes to the fate of the Realms – magical and mundane.”APhilip frowned at that, not sure if he liked the way the goblin put that, but filing it away for further discussion at a later date as the creature continued.A“The Ritual of Blood Inheritance chronicles the entirety of a person’s magical heritage.  It’s been used to settle inheritance debates for years among the wizarding aristocracy and most recently to identify the King-Apparent.  It’s a simple Ritual requiring the use of three drops of blood of the person in question and can only be authorized by that person – no matter their age.”A“What’s the catch?”  Philip asked, knowing there had to be one.A“He’ll be bound to the magic of the Ritual.”  Mycroft supplied knowing that clause quite well.  “If there’s a Lordship he’ll have to Confirm and Claim it.  A magical contract he’ll have to abide by it.  The magic of the Ritual isn’t costly in blood or effort but had the potential to be devastating if one’s unprepared to pay the price.”A“What does it matter where his magical blood comes from?”  Philip probed shrewdly, trying to present the fullest picture possible before his seven-year-old grandson had to make a potentially-life altering decision.  “Where’s the benefit for him in doing the Ritual?”A“Respect.”  Hammerhide held up a beefy hand, ticking off fingers as he went.  “Honor.  Gold.  Education.  All four are possible factors that could be improved through this ritual.  As it stands, your Prince William has no more respect or honor in the Wizarding World than a chamber maid.  And a good deal less than some of them, if they’ve ties to the right House.  Without the proper lineage he won’t gain the right contacts to be accepted into the best schools without throwing a lot of money around.  And the gold he could possibly inherit would help defray the expense of the best wizarding education – not a cheap thing in this world.  Not at all.”A“You really think all of that would be helped along through this ritual?”  The elderly Prince couldn’t see how one bit of magic could change all of those things.A“To attend Hedwig Institute,” Mycroft explained when Hammerhide simply shrugged.  “As what will be called a muggleborn, no matter how well connected in the mundane world, he’ll be placed with the other wealthy muggleborns and commoners from wizarding families.  His tuition – which as a muggleborn will run around sixty-one thousand dollars American per year for the private school – will only cover core classes and one elective.  To have access to the other three electives it’ll be over one hundred-fifty thousand dollars American per year.  And he’ll still be placed with the other muggleborns and commoners – not with the noble children his age and definitely not with the Heirs of the Noble Houses.  He’ll receive the same education for the same price – but not the same connections.  And not even that tuition will get him into the Wizarding Traditions and Culture – that’s strictly for the Noble born.”APhilip whistled under his breath.  “And for Hogwarts?”A“Less expensive per year until he reaches Master-level then it could be more or less.  Supplies are additional funds to the prices I gave you and increase almost every year as more are needed.  There’s not as sharp a divide at Hogwarts, they don’t sort them into weeks the same way that separates the Nobles from the rest, but it’ll still be there just invisible.”AHammerhide put it best:  “To make the connections a future King of England needs with the Nobles of the Empire of Avalon, he needs a Name behind him.  Being sponsored by the Holmes’s will help to be sure.  But some doors will remain closed without a Wizarding Name.”AWilliam spoke up before they could debate any longer.A“I’ll do it.”  He decided, just barely not interrupting his Grandfather.  “I’ll do the Ritual.”A“Are you certain, Wills?”  Philip asked, still not sure himself if all of this was worth it.A“I’m sure.”  He shrugged his lean shoulders.  “It’s the one thing you and Grandmother and Mother and Father all always manage to agree on: getting the best education and learning about my people if I’m going to be King someday.  How can I do that if half of them won’t even talk to me all because I didn’t want to give three drops of blood?”A“How indeed?”  Mycroft said under his breath.A“You understand child that no matter what the Ritual reveals you’re bound by it.”  The Account Manager cautioned.  “If it says your Family cleaned in a hotel or is an Ancient Family that’s it.  If it says you’re a commoner or a Lord.  If there’s property or money or even a marriage contract, you have to accept it.”A“I understand.”  Though he wasn’t sure about the marriage-contract thing.  His Mother said he should be free to fall-in-love and marry as he chooses.  His Father and Grandparents tended to be more pragmatic about it.  He couldn’t see how much worse letting a Ritual decide his spouse could be than letting his Father pick for him.A“Very well.”  Account Manager Hammerhide rose and ushered them from his office, having already made arrangement with Mycroft’s assistant regarding payment for services if the Ritual ends up being a bust.A…AMycroft barely kept the smirk from his face as they walked back to the office of the aged goblin who met them at the doors of the Ritual room, no doubt sent for by Hammerhide as his duty was now complete with the revelation of William’s magical heritage.AHe couldn’t have made William be from a more perfect Family if he’d planned it himself.AThis new goblin – introduced as the Nimue Account Manager Alderbaren – gestured them through into his office, allowing them all to sit before snapping his fingers and summoning the needed files to go over with the new Heir.AThe British Government had been underwhelmed by the display in the Ritual Room – likely because Hadrian’s had been so dazzling it would’ve eclipsed anything less impressive – a bolt of magic in a pure silver had struck the prepared tapestry and quickly with little do-to and pomp revealed the Family Sarah Marlborough had been cast from – though not disinherited – the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Nimue.A“So,” Philip asked gesturing to the parchment in the aged goblin’s crooked hands.  “What does all that mean?”A“The Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Nimue served the Royal Line of LeFey both before and after they joined their territories in what is now France and some of the surrounding mundane areas with the Empire of Avalon.  Their origins like many of the truly Olde Families are lost to time however they were given their current Name after their liege lords joined with Avalon.”  Alderbaren cracked a scary grin.  “They like a few others like to poke fun at the stories of King Arthur told by the mundane masses.  The Lordship will need to be Confirmed on the next Power Day which is the Winter Solstice.  Once Confirmed and young William appoints a Steward, they can access the Nimue Vaults for expenses to cover his education.  William will have to Claim his Lordship on his eleventh birthday like all who become eligible before that age.”A“Contract, Goblin Alderbaren.”  Mycroft examined his nails idly.A“Ah yes.”  The goblin peered over at Holmes.  “The contract.  You would be aware of it.”A“As I was present when the other party was informed of it, yes I am.”A“Which kind of Contract are we discussing?”  Philip had a bad feeling about this.  Holmes was looking entirely too pleased for his comfort.A“The kind you were warned about.”  Mycroft smiled brightly.  “The binding marriage kind.”AAt that point Philip decided that upon returning to Buckingham Palace it was a good day to hie off to Scotland for a spot of hunting.AHe didn’t want to be within a hundred miles when Diana discovered her precious boy was now subject to a binding magical marriage contract.AAnywhere.  He thought firmly with a nod.  Anywhere but within shouting distance of Londontown.A…AShout she did.AAnd storm.AAnd rage.ABut in the end that was all she could do.AWilliam’s fate was set the moment he slammed that door.AThe future-groom in question was blasé about the whole thing.  The thought of marriage and contracts flying mostly over his head after seeing his blood explode and make a tapestry.  Plus Mr. Holmes bought him a frog made of chocolate that actually jumped before you could eat it.AFinally when the dust settled on the results of his inheritance, the main adults in his life sat down to discuss the immediate issues.  Of which his future marriage wasn’t one.  Thankfully for everyone’s eardrums.AArrayed around a meeting table were the Queen, her husband Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Diana – still a furious red, Mycroft, and both of William’s new bodyguards.A“He’ll need a tutor.”  McG said nearly in a grunt.  “If’n it’s with the Heir’s he’ll be then it’s a tutor or no point at all.  Might as well as call ‘im a muggleborn and be done with it.”A“He’s right.”  Mycroft folded his hands on the table before him.  “No matter how poorly phrased.”A“Lupin is the best.”  Shacklebolt offered.  “Even offered a position at Hedwig though I don’t recall if he took it or not.”A“Again.”  Mycroft agreed with a nod.  “You’re correct.  However Remus Lupin is currently serving under a binding private contract elsewhere and is not available for our purposes.  I suggest Andromeda Tonks nee Black.  While not a formally trained tutor she is a Daughter of House Black and capable of teaching William how to fit in with the other Heirs.  She’ll be an extra layer of protection for the Prince having a wicked wand herself and is a fully-qualified Healer in case of emergencies.  I also have it on good authority that she has merely been keeping busy with assisting a study group of those William’s age and younger to stave off boredom now that her daughter is attending Hogwarts.”A“If she is, as you say, a Healer,” Diana asked, inclined to trust him if it meant extra safety for her son.  “Why isn’t she already employed as one?”A“She is.”  Shacklebolt supplied, knowing Andy and Ted well.  “But it’s an exclusive Healing contract with her birth House.  She has to be on-call twenty-four/seven in case they need her.  It doesn’t preclude other employment but does keep her from working either in her own private practice or for a school or hospital.  Andromeda is a grand Lady, Holmes is right about that.  And she comes with valuable connections of her own that could help William when the time comes.”A“What kind of connections?”  Charles’s interest was peaked.A“Black.”  Mycroft answered.  “of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.  If you want William to portray fit in with his peers, there’s no one better to train him before he enters Hedwig than Andromeda.”A“Except Remus Lupin.”  The Queen said drolly.  “But apparently he’s already taken.’AMycroft chuckled.A“Just so, Your Majesty.  Just so.”A…AIt was never a good day when Siger called a “family meeting” Hadrian decided.AThe first time it happened was to tell then five-year-old Hadrian that Dr. John and Sherlock were moving back to London and would only be visiting on the weekends anymore.AThat was a bad day.AOr when they told him about school and how David wasn’t going to be at his lessons with Rhys’s parents anymore.AOr when they told him about how David and Dora were only going to visit during breaks from Hogwarts when the time came for them to go there.AOr that sliding down the bannister in his pajamas was not “appropriate behavior for a Young Gentleman” though that was mostly Lady Maggie.AFamily Meetings were not Hadrian’s favorite things.AAnd keeping in that tone, he was not happy about the reason for this one either.A“What do you mean, I have to share Healer Andy?”  He demanded imperiously, nose shooting up into the air.  “I’m the Heir of her House.  I do not have to share.”ASirius swallowed an ill-timed guffaw with a cough, wincing at the sharp elbow-to-the-ribs he received for his efforts from his mate.  That gem was all James at his same age.  Pure arrogant Potter Heir.AOnly he was pretty sure James’s issue was with sharing his prized broomstick with Sirius and his late-brother Regulus.A“Tone, young man.”  Margeaux frowned harshly.  “Young Gentlemen do not take tones with their guardians and family.”ADropping his chin, Hadrian scowled owlishly at the stern look on Lady Maggie’s normally benign face.A“The Honorable Andromeda Tonks.”  Siger stressed.  They’d been trying to cure Hadrian from using his childhood nicknames for the adults surrounding him in casual conversation.  As a sign of affection between an adult and child it was fine but not as a form of address in public.  “Has been offered a most prestigious position as a guide and tutor to another young Heir.  A gracious Heir and future Lord would congratulate her and wish her well.”A“Healer Andromeda,” Hadrian mimicked just shy of mockery.  He knew that would be a step too far as his bottom had learned the hard way.  “Is my Healer.  She can’t go off and take a contract somewhere else.”  He sent a genuinely confused look over at his main tutor Uncle Remus.  “That’s not how Lord Wallace and Grandpapa Black explained contracts work.  That’s not how Papa Siger explained how contracts work.”A“Ah.”  “Papa” Siger nodded, enlightenment dawning.  Hadrian had begun pushing them more and more lately.  He hadn’t been entirely sure what was precipitating this fit.  Now that they had the crux of it a worse tantrum could be hopefully averted.A“They taught you rightly.”  Remus calmed his cub before expanding on his answer, turning to face the child fully.  “The key here is that Andromeda hasn’t accepted a Healing contract but a Tutoring contract.  She’s irrevocably bound to the House of Black as Healer and cannot take another contract under that aegis, true.  However,” he arched a brow at the little face with eyes that were trying to pin him to the wall.  “Can you honestly tell me that you need Andromeda to wait on you hand and foot?  Do you want her hovering over you with cotton cloths and potions in the case you have a spill from your broom or split your lip boxing with John?”AHadrian frowned then giggled at the image his Uncle Remy brought to life before clapping a hand over his mouth at the sound.  He was a big boy.  A Young Gentleman as Lady Maggie liked to call him.  Big boys and Young Gentlemen don’t giggle.A“I didn’t think so.”  Remus chuckled at the look on his cub’s face.A“Mrs. Tonks,” Mycroft – the barer of bad news – took a sip of tea before continuing.  “Will still be available as needed for any accidents, emergencies, and general Healing needs.  That will not change and the family she’ll be contracted to as a tutor understands that.  However she will also be providing a highly valuable service both to the family in question as well as this Family.”A“How so?”  Sirius asked suspiciously.  There was just something about Mycroft Holmes that rankled him.  Maybe it was that cunning statesman’s polish he had.  Or that if he’d attended Hogwarts he most definitely would’ve been a Slytherin.A“The Heir in question.”  The British Government studied the biscuit and cake try with a canny eye before selecting a wafer-thin slice of lemon cake.  “Is the Heir of Nimue.”AThose who were present at Hadrian’s Inheritance Ritual remembered that Name.  It was on the sole inactive Marriage Contract their charge was subject to.  Which had apparently just gone from inactive to active and binding.AThey hadn’t informed Hadrian of that facet of his Inheritance as yet.  There was no point as long as he still thought that babies were dropped off by a magical stork – John’s original response when first asked the dreaded “where do babies come from” question when Hadrian was five.  Marriage, Betrothals, and Courtships weren’t even due to be covered in his government and Lordship studies until next year with “The Talk” coming sometime between nine and ten.A“That’s one of the Utmost Ancient and Noble Houses.”  Hadrian said with a spark in his eyes.  The rest of that elite group were either held by him or by old people.  “Andromeda is going to teach someone like me…who’s my age?”ARemus and Lady Maggie shared a sad smile, knowing that Hadrian sometimes felt burdened by his accident of birth and lack of companions his age.  With his “cousin” Nymphadora and good friend David off at H.I. several days a week, Hadrian had become more and more withdrawn into his studies and music.  The only time he really had that sweet spark they loved so much was when he went to see Rhys or when Sherlock and John visited.AHadrian had never really lost his attachment to the “Nice Doctor John” who saved his life.A“Yes, dear.”  Margeaux answered, still smiling.  “There’s actually two.  Dowager Longbottom’s grandson who they keep tucked away at the Grange and now this young Heir of Nimue.”A“Can I meet them?”  He asked tentatively.  One thing that had been made very clear to him from the start was that they were extremely cautious about who they allowed around him.  Even the House Elves were vetted before they approved them for service around him.  “It’s just…”A“It would be nice to have more friends?”  Remus finished with gentle understanding.AHadrian nodded bashfully.A“We’ll see what we can do, little lad.”  Siger sighed.  “There’s no guarantee but we’ll see.  Off with you now, you and Remus are getting a late start for your afternoon lessons.”AThe others waited until the boy and his werewolf were out of sight before trading looks.A“Where did that come from?”  Mycroft arched a brow.A“You mean the mini-tantrum?”  Lady Holmes – as known to My as Mummy - blew out an unladylike breath.  “Morgana only knows.  He’s been acting out more and more.  Especially with David and Nymphadora having school and John and Sherlock having a rash of cases.”A“He’s testing the harness.”  Sirius said with a shrug.  “He’s a Potter.  No matter what other titles and lines and duties he has hanging over his head, he’s a Potter.  They’re headstrong and tough little bastards.”  He ignored the look from Lady Holmes.  “They are!  That tone he took with you?  James all over.  I remember him saying something similar to my Aunt Dorea about the same age.  She fixed it right-quick with a stinging hex to his backside.  Potters are fighters and have been since they served the Pendragons.”A“He’s never acted this way before.”  Margeaux pointed out fretfully.  His behavior had become a growing concern between herself and Lady Giovanna.A“Growing pains.”  Sirius shrugged unconcerned.  “He was still dealing with the scars left by those people.  Now that he’s mostly recovered and is more secure he’s bucking at the bit.  Stay firm and be consistent and it’ll blow over.  In time.  The worst thing you could do is coddle him or go soft on him because of what he went through.”A“That sounds like experience talking.”  Siger’s voice was soft.A“’Cause it is.”  The animagus ran one hand through his shaggy ebony mane.  “My parents were beyond controlling.  So when I came to James’s house to escape my Aunt Dorea was easy with me.  James saw that and since Uncle Charlus didn’t think it fair for her to be soft on one of us but not the other she eased up on him.  We were both right-little-toe-rags up until our late teens as a result.  And then we only shaped up because the Auror Academy wasn’t looking for bratlings and Lily wouldn’t have anything to do with an arrogant git like James was at the time.  Go easy on Harry and you’ll have a monster on your hands without the luxury of waiting for him to come out of it on his own with age.  Firm but fair is the way to go, no matter how hard it is to get everyone on board.”A…AThings settled down after that, though to many of the adults in Hadrian’s life they likened it to the calm before the storm.ANo one was fooled by the sudden cessation of temper from a child who’d inherited a formidable one.  The only question was what would set it back off and when.  There were some minor bouts of willfulness resulting in mild punishments like time spent with a nose in the corner or being made to write an essay on the dangers of flying his new broom without supervision but nothing major or shocking.AA time of relative peace and tranquility about to come to a jarring end.A…AIt was the Outing-War that lit the powder keg.ALady Margeaux had cautioned for years since her boys and who were dubbed “Harry’s boys” aka Remus and Sirius had begun one-upping each other when it came to Hadrian’s monthly outings.AIf her boys took him to the zoo to see the elephants during his zoology course, Harry’s boys took him to the magical zoo to spend time with the unicorns during his Care of Magical Creatures module.AThe Tower with Mycroft to see the Crown Jewels?ATo the Black Vault in Gringotts with Sirius to see all of their heirlooms – which Hadrian will inherit in time.AJohn brings him an orphaned kitten for a companion?ARemus buys him an owl to keep in touch with his friends.AAnd on and on and on it went.AOver three years of competition with Hadrian at the center of it.  It was no wonder the boy had started acting out.  As far as he was concerned he was the center of the universe and nothing he’d seen so far had really contradicted that.AEven Andromeda’s new position had required his tacit approval hence why they even discussed it with him in the first place.AThe tantrum-to-end-all-tantrums began innocently enough:ARhys and David, without checking with their parents, invited Hadrian to the opening match of the Quidditch World Cup Series.AOpening day of the Series was a massive event and one that David had received box tickets to for his twelfth birthday in March with the Match occurring in June just over a month-and-a-half before Hadrian’s own eighth birthday.  Being a good friend and knowing that his father’s ward was an Heir though which Heir was a closely-held secret by the adults, David invited him as a sort of pre-birthday gift.  Hadrian had never been to an actual Quidditch match before though he always loved review them on the Omninoculars the Wallace boys would bring him.AAll three of them were nearly prostrate with excitement and since May was to be Uncle Remy & Siri’s month there wouldn’t be a problem.AOr so they thought.A“Out of the question.”  Siger said from behind his morning paper the morning before the Match.  It was a Saturday so only Hadrian and his two foster parents were present for breakfast, Sirius and Remus taking a lie-in.A“But Papa Siger…”  Hadrian’s voice was perilously in danger of being a whine.  “Uncle Remy and Uncle Siri go to Quidditch Matches all the time together.  I’m certain they’d like to go to the Opener.  Besides it’s with the Wallaces.  They’re on the list!”A“The List” being the list of approved companions his guardians had hashed out.  Both of the Wallace sons as well as Andromeda’s daughter Nymphadora were on it.  So were Lord Sherrinford Holmes’s children but they were a little too old and a little too stuffy to make good companions for Hadrian.  His guardians all worried about turning him into “a little old man” with everything he needed to learn before he Claimed his Inheritance.  Having him spend time with a pair of children who preferred dolls to dogs in the case of Helga and books to horses for Hamish wasn’t a good idea.AHe spent time with them as practice for meeting his peers in a formal setting but none of them really took to each other.AHadrian needed childhood companions that actually acted like children despite their lofty birth rather than another person to remind him that he’s a Young Gentleman.AWhich was one of the reasons Mycroft was stalling him on meeting the Heirs Longbottom and Nimue.AWilliam lived under the same pressure of royal birth as Hadrian while Neville by all accounts was very timid.  The danger there was William and Hadrian either feeding off of their “proper” public personas or rebelling completely – which Hadrian was turning out to be proficient at all on his own.  With Neville they didn’t want the quiet boy to disappear completely into the background of Rhys, David, and Dora’s large personalities.A“List or not.”  Siger folded down the paper to peer sternly at his charge.  “You’ve asked and I’ve given my answer.  No Quidditch.”A“But why?!”  Hadrian jumped to his feet, blood rushing to his face, fists clenched tightly at his sides.  “I never get to go anywhere with my friends.  Other kids get to go places.  Rhys gets to go places.  He goes to Quidditch Matches.  He goes to a play group.  He goes to his other friends’ houses.  He gets to go everywhere.”  He gets to have more than one friend.  Hadrian thought wistfully but didn’t dare voice.  “I want to GO!”AAt the shout of GO!  Power burst from Hadrian’s body in a controlled wave, shattering all the glass and crystal in the morning room and breaking the warded windows.  Siger and Margeaux were knocked from their chairs to the floor, Margeaux casting a shield over herself and her defenceless husband as shards of glass and crystal rained down from the ceiling and walls.AFace milk-white and pale from shock, Hadrian swayed on his feet.  His magic had never been outside of his control before.  His magic hurt Papa Siger and Lady Maggie.  He could see a bruise forming on the side of his Papa’s head and Maggie was cradling her arm.AShouting came thundering through the house as the two resident Wizards popped down from their room and searched frantically, wands drawn, for an attacker or invader.ASirius, the former Auror, realized what happened first.  His pup stood at the epicenter of the blast, nearly insensate from the aftermath.  The boy was only keeping upright through sheer force of will.  Reaching over, he laid one hand on his mate’s arm, shaking his head and forcing Remus to lower his wand.AWith a flick of his wrist he repaired what he could and a swish vanished the rest.  Leaving Remus to take care of Hadrian who his lover had already escorted from the room, Sirius crouched next to first the Lady then the Lord, helping each of them to a chair.  After a quick diagnostic showing no real damage done besides a small bruise for him and a twisted wrist for her, he tucked his wand away.AAndy could dispense a few potions once she was finished with Hadrian, his connection with the wards of the House making him aware of both her arrival and current location.A“What happened?”A…ALater that day after everyone had been healed and Andromeda had left, Lord Wallace and Siger’s brother Sherrinford arrived.AAs one, Hadrian’s three guardians entered his bedroom, quickly spying the tear-stained face of the sleeping boy.  Seeing them enter, Remus who had kept watch over the overwrought young wizard, closed his book and reached over, gently shaking his charge awake.  Gritty green eyes blinked up at him before Hadrian rubbed the sleep from them and sat up.  Giving his employers a nod, the werewolf stood and left the room closing the door softly behind him as he took up position in the hall.AThe three Lords strode over to the bed and sat, Gawain choosing to summon an extra chair from the sitting room rather than perch on the bed.A“This can never happen again.”  Lord Wallace said with utter finality.A“I know.”  Hadrian’s voice was rough from his crying jag as he stared down at the comforter puddled on his lap.  “I didn’t mean to.”A“We know that, Hadrian.”  Siger sat forward.  “We know, but it doesn’t change anything.  Your magic is like a sleeping giant.  It’s capable of doing great things when roused.  Unfortunately it can also do terrible things as we saw this morning.”ASherrinford nodded thoughtfully, unconsciously mirror his nephew Sherlock’s favorite stance.A“I believe part of the problem.”  He said slowly as he organized his thoughts.  “Is that you’ve always had control of your magic.  So when you lose it you don’t know what to do or how to handle it.  And that’s our fault for forgetting that powerful you are but you’re still just a boy.  And boy wizards have to be taught to control their emotions when they have great magic.”A“Am I in trouble?”  Hadrian asked fretfully, worrying a corner of his blanket between his fingers.A“Oh, you’re in massive trouble lad.”  Gawain said almost cheerfully.  “As are my own boys.  They never should’ve invited you in the first place without asking, then this whole…episode could’ve been avoided.”A“Our decision is thus,” Siger stood his compatriots joining him.  “This is May and usually your summers are rather lax.  Not so this year.  You’re officially grounded.  That means no owling friends, no visits, no horseback riding or fencing with Rhys.  You’re temporarily banned from the Wallace Estate for the summer.”A“The summer!”  Shocked green eyes looked frantically between the three resolute and diamond-hard faces above him.  “That’s forever!”A“And your tantrum wasn’t worthy of such a punishment?”  Sherrinford asked with an arched brow, looking down at the indignant face.AHadrian subsided at that the picture of Lady Maggie cradling her arm to her chest flashing through his mind.A“Now.”  Gawain crossed his arms.  “Since you’re banned from my Estate, we’ll be having your estate management here instead.  And as you’ve suddenly had some large chunks of time freed up in your schedule you’ll be spending an extra hour each week with Lord Black learning the basics of finance.”AOf all of them Lord Black for all his years had the canniest financial mind.A“That doesn’t fill all of your now-empty hours that would otherwise be spent with your friends.”  Sherrinford added.  “So we’ll be adding onto our language lessons.  You’ve an excellent grasp of Latin and French with a decent ability with German and Gaelic.  You need Russian, Hindi, and Welsh before your coronation and possibly more after.”AIt was only through not wanting to make things worse that Hadrian restrained his groan.A“However.”  Sherrinford smirked.  “If you apply yourself diligently to improving your German and Gaelic…”  He was convinced the only reason the lad wasn’t fluent was because of pure laziness after how easily he’d taken to Latin and French.  “And becoming at least conversant in Russian this summer we will revisit your grounding mid-August and perhaps allow Rhys and David to come over for a long weekend before David starts school again.”A“As another incentive for applying yourself to your studies.”  Gawain added.  “John has informed us that after watching a “documentary” on the mundane Israeli Defense program you’ve expressed an interest in adding Krav Maga to your boxing and wrestling regimen.”A“And don’t think Remus hasn’t told me about your new fascination with sailing.”  Siger rolled his eyes.AOf all the things for the boy to decide he wanted to try why sailing of all things?A“With your schedule already close to bursting at the seams.”  He continued.  “In order for you to add time for more hobbies you’ll either have to sacrifice some of your free-time…”A“He doesn’t have enough as it is.”  Gawain repeated his constant issue with his future Lord’s schedule.A“…or complete an area of study to everyone’s satisfaction.”A“Right now Languages is the only area where you’re slacking.”  Sherrinford said pointedly.  “Apply that prodigious mind of yours to them and I’m sure we can take some time in the Fall and see about things like sailing or martial arts.”ASherrinford and Gawain bid Hadrian goodbye and then nodded to Siger, leaving him to inform their charge about the rest of his punishment.  A young man’s pride could be a sticky thing, no need to possibly bruise it further when it was already stinging.A“You really worried us, Harry.”  Siger sat on the side of the bed and drew his foster-son into a close hug.  “You could’ve hurt yourself even worse than another person.”A“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”  Hadrian chanted softly, digging his face into his Papa’s shirt.  “I didn’t mean it!  I was just so mad and then upset and then my chest started to hurt and I just wanted it to stop hurting!  I didn’t think it would hurt anyone.”A“Shhh.”  Siger rocked him gently.  “Easy now, lad.  Easy.”ASeveral long moments later when Siger judged Hadrian ready to continue he spoke.A“The grounding is your punishment for arguing back and snapping at us.  The extra lessons aren’t a punishment they’re to keep you out of trouble.  We’re also going to be firm about your meditation exercises with Remus, I know you’ve been absent-minded about it, skiving off early for biscuits or to fit an extra half-hour of play with Rhys in.  That stops now.  You need those exercises to help control your emotions and magic, lad.  We’ve just seen what can happen firsthand if you don’t keep up with it – at least until your magic smooths out and stops growing which should happen…eventually.”A“Ok.”A“Now Andromeda sent for Ted and we’ve talked it over with him.  Starting tomorrow you’re having weekly visits with him again during the week as well as on Saturdays.  Hopefully between talking things out with Ted and him helping you with your Occlumency we can stop something like this from happening again.”A“What about using a focus?”  Hadrian offered, trying to be helpful.  “David and Dora both have wands now and Rhys uses a training wand.  Don’t wands help regulate magic?”ASiger shook his head, sighing.  He knew this would come up eventually.  Had Remus not argued so ferociously when he started tutoring his foster-son Hadrian would have a training wand as well.  But until today he’d never needed artificial means to wrangle his magic.AIt’d been as natural as breathing.A“A wand or another focus would be a crutch for you.”  He explained once he found the right way to put it.  “You’re a true magical prodigy, son.  The kind that only pops up every couple generations.  Magic Herself has Blessed you.  Using a focus would be like taking Her Blessing and shoving it into a box a hundred times too small.”A“That would be bad.”  Hadrian observed with a child’s simple logic.A“Yes,” Siger chuckled at the thought of offending Magic Herself in such a way.  “Yes it would.  Now for the rest of your punishment you’re going to clean the breakfast room – by hand, no magic, and no elves – until it sparkles.  You can ask the elves for direction but they are not to do it for you.  Once you’ve finished you’ll write a formal apology to myself and Lady Holmes.  It should be comprehensive and using your best parchment and finest penmanship.”A“Yes, Papa.”  Hadrian winced at the cleaning but had thought it would be something like that.ALady Maggie was a big fan of Like-for-Like.AHe’d messed up the room so he wasn’t surprised he’d be expected to put it back the way it was.A“There’s my good lad.”  Siger squeezed him tight before rising.  “Now I believe you have a snack waiting in your sitting room and there is a breakfast table in need of a polishing before lunch.”ARolling his eyes Hadrian gave him a half-grin.A“Yes, Papa.”A…AThankfully for all that came into contact with him that summer, Hadrian mostly accepted both his punishment and the compromise from Sherrinford with his natural good grace.AWhile vocal about missing his friends and how much he loathed trying to make his quill form the Cyrillic alphabet for his Russian lessons, Hadrian had also been given something to strive for, something that had been absent with his life being so routine.AThe biggest disappointment of the summer was not having an eighth birthday party and not being able to join John and Sherlock at the King Tut exhibit at the Museum before it left for its tour of America.AThough the party was cancelled the friend restriction was temporarily lifted so they could deliver their gifts in person a couple days before the end of July.  And while the Wallace boys had been punished for their part in Hadrian’s bad behavior, their parents couldn’t justify taking away what had been a birthday gift of its own…so they were able to attend the Match and Hadrian got a pair of Omnioculars upon turning eight.AHadrian’s guardians meanwhile had had another major meeting with the children were occupied and discussed what to do about the friend situation.  Next Fall would herald Rhys’s first year at Hedwig and David and Dora at Hogwarts, he would only be able to spend time with Rhys for an hour or two on Saturdays.  Hadrian needed a big social group.AA plan was finally hatched to mimick the two play-groups that were already in existence: one run by Molly Weasley at the community center in the magical portion of Ottery-St-Catchpole and the other which tended to cater to the noble children of former Death Eaters and was in Wiltshire.ANeither group would be suitable for Hadrian to join, if for security purposes alone but did provide a template for them to use.AUsing the Wallace Estate and a free time-slot in Hadrian’s schedule on Wedsnesdays, it would be overseen by Lady Wallace with help from Remus Lupin and Andromeda Tonks as available.  Which as both of them had run such groups before made for an easy sell to the children they wanted Hadrian to meet and possibly befriend.ARhys would attend for this year of course, the Diggory Heir Conan was a year younger than Hadrian but his older cousin Cedric was well behaved so they thought Conan would do fine.  Convincing Dowager Longbottom to let her grandson attend was an…ordeal.  But one that Margeaux eventually won.  Susan, the Bones Heiress, came along with her good friend Hannah and her younger sister Ester.  Luna, the slightly dotty Lovegood Heiress came as well, her mother Athena being great friends with Giovanna.  Adrian Pucey was the same age as Rhys and a last-minute addition, however as it turned out his mother was the younger sister of Gawain and thought her son could benefit from socializing with a new crowd since he usually attended the same group as the Malfoy and Nott Heirs.ARegina Pucey nee Wallace wanted her son to meet people besides the children of his father’s cronies.  As it was she nearly had to fight tooth-and-nail to get Adam to agree for him to be allowed around her brother’s children and their friend.  Honestly, if it wasn’t included in their marriage contract she didn’t think the man would even let her see her brother.APolitics were the bane of sensible women everywhere who had hide-bound husbands.A…AEight turned out to be a much happier year for Hadrian than seven.AEven though he never returned to the cheerfully-biddable child he was during the first years of his new life, his guardians found themselves thankful for it, taking it as a sign that he was able to overcome the conditioning forced upon him during his “Dursley years.”AInstead his personality seemed to have found a happy medium – for the moment – between the cheerful early-Hadrian and the snarly seven-year-old-Hadrian.  While some of the adults credited his growing maturity to his age and prodigious mind, Remus who arguably spent the most time with him, saw it differently.AUp until the “Quidditch Incident” every moment of his life was scheduled for him.  Every decision was made for him by those around him before he even woke up in the morning.  The only time his opinion ever truly counted was when it came to playing games with Rhys – the only person in his life who let Hadrian really make decisions.AIt was well-meant tyranny but totalitarian in the extreme.AWhich wasn’t a problem when he was younger and still afraid he’d somehow screw up and they wouldn’t want him anymore.AThe time was always going to come that he recovered enough from his trauma that he was going to want more control over his life…especially with all of them telling him that someday he was going to be a Lord and a King.  When he was younger it didn’t matter because those were fuzzy concepts to grasp even for a prodigy.  But by the time he turned seven he’d definitely figured it out.AAnd figured out that what they were asking of him wasn’t the same as how they were treating him.ADisciplining him and making him deal with the consequences of his actions – the “Like for Like” method Lady Maggie preferred and Sirius had strongly advocated – had helped immensely with Harry-the-Boy.ATalking to him rationally about what he wanted and how he wanted to spend his time – and then figuring out what was plausible and then making it happen – and showing him what he needed to do so he could learn Krav Maga and take up sailing…that all spoke to Hadrian-the-Heir.AUnfortunately the only people that easily reconciled the two were his foster-father and his werewolf-uncle.AThe rest tended to only cater to half of his personality: either the sweet boy or the headstrong Heir.  But that wasn’t working anymore.  Hadrian had gained a taste of making an independent decision when he strove to master the languages set before him and succeeding then being rewarded with the marital arts lessons he so desperately wanted.AThankfully by being exposed to a larger group of children, he’d also seen that while his education and how his guardians were with him could be a pain sometimes, he wouldn’t trade places with many of the others for all the gold in Gringotts.AWhile Lord and Lady Wallace seemed like ideal parents to him there was always a distance.  Gawain couldn’t quite disassociate the child that needed teaching and guidance from his future Lord and Giovanna followed his lead.AConan Diggory’s parents were okay but always rather stiff when they came to pick him up from the Wallace Estate…and Neville Longbottom’s Gran was just scary.AYes, he decided with a nod.  Even though his guardians made him study things like the differences between Marriage, Betrothal, and Courtship Contracts for a whole month, he wouldn’t trade places with anyone he knew.AAThings were just about perfect.A…AIt was during his weekly chess game and politics primer with Mycroft that he was tested on his knowledge.AInformation new and old was always on the table for discussion, with the statesman often teaching him new ways to look at things or different ways things could have been managed from his history lessons to create a better effect.AInvariably, the discussion would wind its way around to whatever subject was currently preying on Hadrian’s impressive mind.AHadrian studied the board in front of him with narrowed eyes.  They were playing mundane chess today, with Mycroft taking the ivory pieces.  He’d just made his opening salvo and his young opponent was trying to deduce his strategy the way Sherlock had been coaching him during their games after Sunday dinners.APlacing it as the opening for the Russian Game, Hadrian countered then glanced up with a Holmesian smirk.A“Feeling international today, My?”AThe British Government chuckled.  “Well, I did stop another potential Cuban-missile crises today.”AThey played a few more moves before Mycroft asked the question.A“What’s bothering you, little King?”ALittle King had become their code for Mycroft being willing to answer questions.  Even ones the other adults in Hadrian’s life rather he didn’t.A“You know how I remember things?”  Hadrian winced at the poorly-phrased gambit that went with the misstep that cost him his Queen’s bishop.A“Hn.”  His foster-brother studied the mistake with a shake of his head and nabbed the misplaced piece with a pawn before sitting back.  “Very much so.  Your memory is much like mine and Sherlock’s…though you don’t tend to ‘delete’ information you think is useless the way my brother does.  What of it?”A“The Lords explained Marriage, Betrothal, and Courtship Contracts to me a couple months ago.  Spent ages on them making sure I knew the differences, how to write them to the benefit of my Houses, when to approve them and when to deny them,” he waved his hand in a vague gesture before moving a Knight to guard his Queen’s flank.  “Everything.”A“Well, I rather thought that was coming as I saw you were to magical contracts both binding and non-binding in father’s lesson plans.”  Mycroft responded non-committedly – both in word and on the board.A“My.”  The name was a put-upon sigh complete with an eye roll.A“Harry.”  Mycroft mimicked, putting his little brother’s Queen in jeopardy.A“I remember.”  Hadrian stressed, moving his castle to intercept his brother’s bishop and taking it for good measure.  “When we were at the bank.  When I was so sick and hurt.  I.  Remember.”AThat had his brother lifting his head warily.  Piercing blue eyes tracked every tiny movement of bright green, checked and cross-checked every twitch of the still-young face that as yet maintained a hint of baby-fat.  So young.  And so gods-damned smart.ALike Sherlock.AThough thankfully not obsessed with death and murder.AOne of those was enough in a family.A“You want to know about who exactly you’re contracted to and how.”  Mycroft shook his head and rose, knocking his King over with an irritated flick of one long finger.  “Checkmate.  Come on, little king.  This is a conversation that requires more people…and quite a bit of brandy.”",The Avalon Seven,108617

LeStrade – it was the middle of a Wizengamot session requiring Sherrinford and Gawain be present to protect their interests, and Mycroft had to deal with the rising tensions between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern countries.AThough as promised in the day did finally arrive – there was plenty of brandy on hand.ATed and John had taken it upon themselves immediately following Hadrian’s ninth birthday to give him “The Talk.”  Their logic being that it’ll be much, much easier to explain some of the details of the contracts if the boy at least understands the grittier parts of them.  It was much less painful than the discussion the contracts themselves were slated to be.ATaking advantage of his ability to comprehend subjects well beyond his age group, John and Ted each selected several books that would discuss the…mechanical…process of sex as well as the mental/emotional processes involved.  Most adults would’ve simply left it as the mechanical/biological process and been done with what is stereotypically an uncomfortable subject.  But with the contract discussion looming ever-nearer that wasn’t going to be enough.AJohn went with a volume usually used with college-level coursework titled: “Human Sexuality and Reproduction.”  It was very comprehensive and covered most of the mundane side of things – including a fair and unbiased take on homosexuality and other preferences that were beyond “Insert Peg A into Slot B.”ATed likewise had chosen what would be used as a teacher’s edition for sex education in a wizarding school.  He knew Hadrian would be able to grasp the magical theory involved easily and it even gave an overview on the various methods same-sex couples of both genders could reproduce.  Interestingly enough in anti-creature Britain it also included information about creatures and creature mixes that could bond and/or breed with wizards and witches though unlike John’s volume it wasn’t anywhere close to unbiased.AThe conversation that followed after giving him a week to read and process the volumes went something like this:A...AHadrian sat swinging his legs idly on the settee in his sitting room while Ted and John traded “go ahead, no you go ahead looks.”  Finally making a decision – there might’ve been rock-paper-scissors involved – John caved and spoke first.A“Do you have any questions about the books we asked you to study, little one?”  John winced as the pet-name slipped out.  He knew Hadrian was old enough and mature enough for “The Talk” but it still felt wrong.  All he could see was the little bundle of hair and eyes staring up at him, trusting him enough to carry him through his first floo trip.A“A couple.”  Hadrian admitted with zero hesitance.  He couldn’t understand why Dr. John and Healer Ted were being so…weird.  If he was having his conversation with Sherlock they would’ve already had a logical breakdown of the issue complete with graphs and charts.  Maybe an experiment dealing with brain chemistry.AWhich was exactly why Sherlock had been outvoted when he lobbied to do it instead of John.A“Go on, then.”  Ted smiled, leaning over to prop his bent arms on his lap.A“Boys.”  Hadrian corrected himself remembering the phrase used in the text.  “Magical Males…they can have babies but mundane males can’t…right?”A“That’s right.”  The mind healer nodded.  That one had thrown him during his own sex ed class years ago.  Finding out that if he’d been bent he could get pregnant had certainly put a damper on any experimenting he might’ve been interested in doing.A“And I’m supposed to get married.”A“Yes, when you’re older.”  John confirmed.A“And it’s ok to like boys if you’re a boy and girls if you’re a girl.”A“Absolutely, little one.”AThis was where Hadrian actually had a question.A“…Does that mean I’m going to have a baby?...”AJohn about spit his lemonade across the room.AAnd they thought giving him “The Talk” would be easier because he was smarter than most.  Hah.  It just meant he had more creative questions to ask and make them squirm.A…AFull glasses of brandy in hand – except for Hadrian who was given just a tiny amount at the bottom of his glass – the needed persons gathered around the large table in the Ravenscroft Hill formal dining room.AHadrian who had started his education about wines as part of his Deportment and Manners lessons, wrinkled his nose a bit at the smell that wafted up from his glass.  It was much muskier than the sweet wines Sherrinford was starting him out with.  He still didn’t understand the appeal but allowed that the “grown-ups” tended to like it.AGawain in his Steward persona had claimed the seat at the head of the table, files denoting the binding contracts in question spread out before him.  There were three piles.  In the gold folders were the ones between two Royal Houses, in the silver between a Royal House and a Noble House, and the bronze were Noble House to Noble House.  Thankfully that also separated the two betrothal contracts from the marriage contracts, allowing him to proceed in a logical manner.AWhich will hopefully keep outbursts from Sherlock to a minimum.A“Well, Hadrian.”  Mycroft said, swirling the brandy in his glass as he lounged in his chair to Gawain’s immediate left.  “What questions do you have about what you remember?”AMycroft had informed the key parties as to what precisely had been said between himself and their charge, John and Ted doing the same though the latter wasn’t present for this conversation.A“I know that I have to get married.”  He said taking a deep breath.  “And I know that there are contracts involved.  Other than that, no one has ever said anything about this whole…thing.”A“We would have, pup.”  Sirius said, rubbing one hand down Hadrian’s arm from his spot next to him.  They’d placed the two people best at soothing Hadrian at his sides: Sirius on his left and Remus on his right.  “When it was time.  You just grow up too fast for us to always keep pace.”A“Now there’s an understatement.”  Siger muttered into his glass, taking a swig.  This year marked the tipping point.  Hadrian had officially been in his care longer than he hadn’t been.  Now they had to tell him a large facet of his life had already been decided.ATitles were one thing.  People were born into titles every day.  Marriage on the other hand was a personal, intimate decision.AOr at least it should be.AHadrian focused back on his Steward who took a breath and put aside his personal feelings – very personal in one case – and gave his future Lord and King what he wanted.A“There are six binding magical contracts.  Two are Marriage Contracts between Royal Houses, two are Marriage Contracts between one of your Royal Houses and a Noble House, and two are Betrothal Contracts between Noble Houses.  All of them specify ages of fulfillment and all of them require Heirs to be born.  You are also subject to the Last of Line laws.  As a result,” Gawain took a deep drink of his brandy.  “You will have to gain a total of thirteen Consorts either through the current contracts or by Courting or being Courted by suitable parties.”AThat took Hadrian aback for a moment.A“Thirteen?”  He echoed then frowned.  “But I’m not that Last of several of those Lines…am I?  I know I Inherited them but there’s other of the Blood out there.  Like Siri and Dora for House Black.”A“You’re right, Harry.”  Remus said, folding his hand on the table before him, ignoring his glass of brandy.  “And you’re also wrong.  We haven’t gotten to this yet in your lessons but when you underwent the Ritual of Blood Inheritance you didn’t just qualify and were immediately given thirteen Houses.  No.  Magic Herself chose to bestow them upon you.  You are the one Magic deemed worthy of renewing thirteen Magical Lines.  Just as She decided others of the Blood were not worthy.”AThe werewolf made no mention of the Houses Magic hadn’t entrusted to Harry for whatever reason.  The magical Lines of Avalon were so tangled there were hundreds of defunct Lines waiting for an Heir or a renewal if they were magical but not Noble.  Just as there were probably thousands of people who had the necessary lineage to Claim one of the Thrones of Avalon.ABut Magic chooses.AJust as She chose Harry.A“What am I supposed to do with thirteen husbands or wives?”  Hadrian asked weakly, eyes wide.ASirius opened his mouth to give a snickering answer only to lose his breath with an “oomph” when Remus elbowed him in the stomach.  Hard.AThat was going to leave a bruise.AIgnoring that particular train-wreck, Gawain continued with his report.A“The contracts and details are as follows:AMarriage:  House of Emrys and House of Nimue.  The Crown Prince or King-Apparent of the House of Emrys with an eligible Heir of Nimue.  The Heir of Nimue shall be Honorably Courted and Properly Betrothed to the Heir of Emrys and They Shall Be Bonded in Matrimony by the Coronation of the Heir of Emrys or the Heir’s sixteenth birthday whichever is first.  Consummation must occur within one year with no less than two Heir produced by the Heir of Emrys’s twenty-first birthday.”ARemus needed that drink now.  His cub had to get married before he turned thirteen or lose his magic…or life.A“Marriage: House Ravenclaw and House Prince.”A“Prince?”  Sirius growled.  “My pup has to marry one of Snape’s get?  Over my dead body!”A“No,” his mate snapped.  “It’ll be Harry’s dead body if he doesn’t comply.  Ritual of Blood Inheritance, remember?  Even if breaking the contract would only render him a squib, the Ritual will take his life for the offense.”AThe animagus slugged back the rest of his brandy before prowling over to the bar and pouring another glass.  Taking that as a tacit agreement of silence – at least until later – Gawain continued.A“Marriage: House Ravenclaw and House Prince.  To afford cessations of Hostilities between the Empire of Avalon and the Empire of Rome.  The Heir of Ravenclaw shall wed with the Heir of the Ambassador to Avalon, House Prince.”A“Well, shit.”  Sherlock said blinking.  “How old is that contract?”A“Two thousand years…give or take.”  Gawain said drily.  “Apparently House Ravenclaw didn’t ever have another eligible Heir.  I looked it up and the Ravenclaws used Marriage to stop wars…a lot.  By the time Helena died without issue Prince was the last one in a long line of contracts, they raffled off their kids two hundred years before they were even born.”A“Interesting bunch, Ravenclaws.”  Mycroft noted.  “From a political perspective anyway.”ASnapping his wrist Gawain returned to his recital.A“It’s the same as the other except for the ages.”  Gawain summed up.  “Courtship, Betrothal, then Marriage which has to be done by Hadrian’s fifteenth birthday with the requisite two Heirs ‘once the Heir of Ravenclaw as finished their education’ which if Hadrian did enough Masteries could put off having Heirs for this contract indefinitely.”A“That’s something at least.”  Sirius grumbled, pouting.A“The Marriage Contracts with Egypt and Japan are exactly the same and were made around the same time though with different Houses, Japan LeFey and Egypt Slytherin.  Marriage by age sixteen, one Heir by eighteen with another by twenty-two.”A“And the bronze files?”  Hadrian prompted brain busily lining the information up in his head.A“Betrothals.”  Here is where Gawain became really, really uncomfortable.  “Usually Betrothal contracts have an “out” clause if you will – which both of these do.  However…”  He trailed off, looking away from his audience.A“What’s the out?”  Sherlock asked.  “Must be bad if you can’t bring yourself to say it.”AGawain scrubbed his hands over his face.A“The only way to break these Betrothals is if after the Betrothals are in place…Hadrian’s Betrothed’s are proven Unfaithful or Traitors to the Crown of Avalon.”A“I can see how that would make you uncomfortable, Gawain.”  Sherrinford took a delicate sip of his rather excellent brandy.  “Seeing as how one of those Betrothal Contracts is between Hadrian and whichever of your sons he decides best suits him.”A“What?”  Hadrian asked icily, eyes glinting.  “I’m supposed to marry David or Rhys?”A“Yes.”  Gawain choked out.  “You are.”A“They’re my friends.”  He protested, looking to Siger for help.  “My friends.  And they’re boys.  I don’t even know if I like boys…like that.  Or girls.  I’m too young for that.  They’re my friends.”A“We know, lad.”  Siger wrapped one arm around the shaking boy.  “When Ragnok told us about your contracts and the Last of Line business we debated long and hard over how we were going to handle it.  In the end we thought it would be best if at least in this one case you could know your possible spouse from a young age.  We thought it would make it easier when you got older.”A“Easier,” Hadrian laughed much too bitterly for a child.  “Right.”ALooking up at his Steward out of betrayed emerald eyes he gave the man his first-ever command.A“Finish it.  Then leave.”ALord Wallace clenched his jaw then nodded, speaking briskly.A“The Contract between House Valerius and House duLac is simple but binding.  You’re expected to become officially betrothed by seventeen and married by eighteen unless the person you select proves unfaithful or a traitor to the crown.  In the case of House Pevensie and House Wallace,” his breath stuttered before smoothing out.  “You have to select your betrothed by fourteen and wed them by eighteen.”ALeaving the files on the table for the others to study, Lord Wallace rose to his feet and gave Hadrian a crisp bow before taking his leave – as commanded.ASilence flowed thick in his wake.A“That was unkind, Hadrian.”  Margeaux scolded him.  “He was only trying…”AHadrian held up a hand, somehow coming across as imperious even while cuddled between his two appointed comforters.A“He’s been trying to rig the game.”  Hadrian said, nearly in tears.  “And has been from the first time I set foot in his home.  Making sure Rhys was always the first one to see me, was the first one to become my friend.  And Lady Wallace was just as bad if not worse.  Forcing Rhys to partner me…even though he’d rather have a rusty nail driven through his eye than dance.  They just didn’t want their precious Heir stuck in a marriage he couldn’t get out of without shaming their House.”  He scoffed, rising to his feet and making his way slowly toward the door.  “I can’t even blame them, not really.  After all, what do I matter to them when weighed against the Honor of House Wallace?”A…ARhys frowned, searching through the faces of his friends as they all gathered to celebrate his birthday.  He’d finally gotten having his best-friend come approved for the first time ever.  He was so excited to introduce Hadrian to Cormac and Blaise.  Hadrian already knew most everyone else.AThat’s if he ever shows up.A“Dad?”  Rhys found his father staring broodingly at the fire in the floo room, still waiting on guests.  “Where’s Hadrian?  I thought you said he could come?”AGawain startled at the sound of his son’s voice, turning to watch as his handsome child crossed the tiled floor in an athletic lope.AThey all were growing up so fast…A“I did.”  Gawain nodded as his son reach his side.  “I did say that.  But he might not come today.”A“Why?”  Rhys asked, staring up at his hero with the black eyes he inherited from his mother.  They were striking with his deep chestnut hair and pale skin.  “Did he get in trouble again?”A“No,” his father chuckled with forced lightness.  “He’s not in trouble, son.  I’m afraid I am with him.”A“I didn’t know that was possible.”  His son cocked his head to the side confused.  “Adults getting in trouble with kids.  I thought Hadrian was your Ward.  Doesn’t it work the other way around.”A“Most of the time.  But Hadrian isn’t your ordinary kid or ward.”A“Tell me about it.”  Rhys rolled his eyes.  “Sometimes he talks and it’s like an adult comes out.  Or you when you’re being a Lord and stuff.”AEven in his present mood Gawain had to grin at that apt description.A“So what did you do?  You know.  To make Hadrian mad at you?”AHere Lord Wallace stumbled.  He’d made an agreement with his wife not to inform the boys about the Contract.  Not until Hadrian decides who to Court.  They didn’t want either boy treating him differently because of an accident of inheritance.A“It must be bad if you don’t want to tell me.”  Rhys observed knowingly.  “Did you at least say you’re sorry?”A“I would.”  Gawain said.  “But I’m not sorry.”A“I know.”  Hadrian said from behind them, face stony.ANeither Wallace male had noticed the fire flaring green and Hadrian and Remus stepping out, too involved in their discussion.A“Hadrian!”  Rhys cheered.  “You made it!”AHadrian’s aristocratic face softened at his friend’s normal welcome.  At least his friends weren’t in on their parents’ plot.ASeeing the tension between his cub and Lord Wallace, Remus held up the brightly-wrapped gift in his arms.A“Why don’t you show me where you’re stashing your loot, Rhys?”  Remus suggested, ushering the older boy from the room.  Leaning down he whispered in his ear:  “You don’t want to know.  Trust me on this one.”ABack in the floo room, Hadrian inspected Lord Wallace’s guilt ravaged face with his piercing green eyes.  After several long moments he finally spoke.A“Don’t think for one second that my presence here means we’re ok.”  He hissed, nearly spitting the words.  “You may be David and Rhys’s father and the Lord of House Wallace and have a duty to them.  I understand that.  However.”  His voice turned to ice.  “I am the King-Apparent of Avalon and you are supposed to be my Steward.  You are supposed to put the good of the Realm first.  Not attempt to manipulate the future King into choosing a spouse as it best suits you.”AHadrian took a deep breath, reining in his temper and counting slowly under his breath, Occluding is emotions.A“Hadrian and his guardian Gawain will probably recover from his.”  He said in a flat monotone.  “But the King-Apparent of Avalon and his trusted Steward might not.  We,” he continued using the Royal We for the first time in his life.  “Are now forced to give serious consideration as to whether the House of Wallace will remain a part of Our Privy Council once We Claim Our Throne.”AMessage – and warning – delivered, Hadrian turned on his heel and strode from the room, bringing up a happy mask for his friend in the process.AHe left behind him a shattered Steward and what little remained of the trust he used to have in him.A…ANine was turning out to be better and worse than seven, his current barometer for how much a year sucked.AHe hadn’t lost control of his magic again so from that perspective it was a total win.ABut finding out about Lord Wallace trying to engineer one of the few choices he had as far as his own spouses goes…that almost slapped the top of his suckage-meter.AWhat really, truly, got under his skin wasn’t his Steward trying to advance his House or manage who his kids married.  No, as far as he could tell that was normal Lord/father behavior.  It was the underhandedness of it all.AIf he’d been told: someday you’re going to have to pick either David or Rhys to marry; when they first met even if too young to really “get” it, that would’ve been one thing.AIf it’d never been mentioned but he wasn’t pushed into being friends with them either.ABut neither of those things happened.  He wasn’t told and David and Rhys were two of the only kids he was allowed to be around for years.  It wasn’t just cunning – he was foster-brother to Mycroft Holmes, he had a deep appreciation for cunning.  It was dishonest.AHow could he as Heir to the Throne of Avalon trust his Steward if he was dishonest?ASighing, Hadrian stood from the piano bench where he’d been making no more progress on his assigned piece than he was knitting.  Walking over to one of the big bay windows he curled up against one of the fluffy cushions and stared out into the gloomy day.  His mind churning the same questions over and over until he worried himself asleep.A…A“This has really shaken him.”  Siger commented to Remus as the two bedrocks of Hadrian’s life watched him curl up in the window seat from out in the hall.A“It was bound to.”  Remus shook his head in disgust.  “I was confused at first over why he was so upset.  Then he told me about how Giovanna always pushed him on Rhys and separated him from David, forcing him basically to pick the second son instead of the Heir.  And Gawain didn’t do a damned thing to stop her.  I’d be pissed too.”A“Greater men than Gawain have fallen victim to the manipulations of a beautiful young wife.”  Siger gestured for Remus to stay and watch Hadrian as he turned to leave.  “I just hope Gawain fixes this mess before Hadrian’s trust in him in completely gone.”A“It’s already at the breaking point.”  Remus said to himself after the older man was gone.  “Wouldn’t take much at all to make it snap.  And if that happens, Merlin help us all.”A…AFurious shouting and accusations thundered throughout the halls of the Wallace Estate as Rhys and David took cover from the hurricane in the warded library.A“What’s been going on?”  David asked his brother harshly.  He’d been gone a lot, hanging out with his friends from H.I.  There had been something off between their father’s ward Heir Potter and their father on Rhys’s birthday but no one knew what.A“I have no idea.”  Rhys turned to face his big brother.  “Hadrian showed up late last week.  I’d gone to find Dad and asked him about it and he told me he was in trouble with Hadrian.  When I said I didn’t know it was possible for guardians to be in trouble with their wards Dad said something about how Hadrian wasn’t a normal ward and that he might skip my party.”A“He was there though.”A“I know, that’s the really weird thing.”ABoth boys winced as their mother’s voice reached a crystal-breaking decibel.  Rhys lowered his own to a bare whisper.A“When he finally got there Mr. Lupin left with me and Hadrian stayed behind.  I don’t know what happened between him and Dad but it was bad.  Really, really bad.  Mr. Lupin said I was better off not knowing what was going on.”A“Well,” David drawled.  “Whatever it is, it definitely led to this.”AThey shuddered as a door slammed with a resounding crack!  And the sound of a painting falling from the wall reached their ears.A“I hate it when they fight, Davie.”  Rhys whispered, cuddling closer in towards his brother.ADavid swung an arm around him, holding him close as the battle continued to rage.A“Me too, Ry.”  He answered.  “Me too.”A…A“That is enough, Giovanna!”  Gawain shouted at the end of the rope.  “You will take a Vow to stop matchmaking and attempting to manipulate my Ward or I will banish you to your dower house!  Don’t you understand what your actions and my complicity have done?”A“Pah!”  Giovanna Wallace, formerly Giovanna Bianchessi flung off his words with a flambouyent wave of her arm.  “He is a child.  What possibly could I have done that is so bad about a little matchmaking?  He’ll be back here tomorrow like nothing had happened.”A“Hadrian is not just some child, Giovanna!”  Times like this he almost wished he could tell her who Hadrian really is.  “When he claims his inheritance he’ll be one of the most powerful men in the country,” world, “our family cannot afford to lose his Patronage.”A“Oh please.”  She shrugged him away when he tried to grab her by the shoulders.  “He’s a boy.  Buy him a broom or a horse and it’ll be all better.”A“Because of your underhanded matchmaking Giovanna.”  His voice went flat.  “I’m in danger of losing my Stewardship.  How can any Lord have a Steward he can’t trust to hold his Lord’s interests dearer than his own?  I’m not even sure that both of us making Vows – you to stop and me of Loyalty and Honesty – will save our family.”A“So David will marry into a more powerful family.”  Giovanna suggested with a smirk.  “Then it won’t matter at all.”AGawain groaned, throwing his hands up in despair.A“And who,” he asked scathingly.  “Is more powerful than the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Potter?”A“Haven’t you heard the rumors?”  She was almost giddy with excitement.  “Someone leaked a story with an informant inside Gringotts.”ALord Wallace felt dread tingle down his spine as he sat heavily.A“What story?”A“That there’s been activity from the Vaults of the Avalon Seven.”  She knelt down at his feet.  “Don’t you see?  David is beautiful, he takes after me.”  She said with zero sarcasm.  “He’s sure to catch the eye of the new King, whoever it might be.  We just have to keep the Potter child happy enough until the King emerges and then use his Family’s deep connections to the Crown for our David.  We could be the grandparents to the next King!”AOh Godric’s Hairy Ass.  His wife had gone completely ‘round the twist.AHe supposed it was what he got for marrying a beautiful woman half his age.  He knew she was ambitious.  He didn’t think she was crazy with it.A“Let me see if I’ve got this straight.”  He pinched his nose between two callused fingers.  “You’ve, intentionally mind you, threatened a relationship that goes back for hundreds of years on the miniscule chance that one there actually is an Heir to Avalon and two that he’ll be interested in David over Rhys and every other eligible person in his Empire?”A“Well when you put it that way…”  She pouted rocking back on her heels.A“Screw the Vow.”  He stood, shaking her off.  “You’re hereby confined to your dower estate in the Italian Alps.  Mitzy!”  He called for a house elf.  “Take Lady Wallace and the belongings she brought with her upon our marriage to her dower property.  She is not to leave there under any circumstances nor is she to receive visitors or post besides myself or from myself.”AHe ignored the screaming/shouting/crying/throwing-figurines-at-his-head as he continued down the hall in search of his sons.A…AGiovanna was removed – though David and Rhys didn’t quite understand the situation they knew their Dad wouldn’t have done it without cause – and Hadrian accepted the Vow of Loyalty and Honesty in all Dealings from his Steward.AGawain also passed along to King Ragnarok via Goblin Ragnok about the leak occurring in Gringotts – bringing a swift halt to the speculations about what was going on with Hadrian’s Vaults.AAnd things settled back down for the most part.ALord Wallace was a little more humble, Hadrian had learned a valuable lesson about blind trust – even with those closest to him, and his friendship with the Wallace boys bloomed anew, no trace in word or deed that Hadrian knew one of them was slated for his future Consort.ATime creaked on by, bringing Winter then Spring and another Summer.AHadrian turned ten and with that came the knowledge that Rhys wouldn’t be around much with his H.I. schedule.ABut he still had an overfull lesson plan each week and had continued see those in the social group Giovanna had originally brought together before her banishment.AThough with Rhys leaving the group for the most part, Hadrian and Neville were woefully outnumbered by girls, forcing them to grow closer.  A feat which had some of Hadrian’s nature confidence rubbing off on the quiet, shy Longbottom Heir.  But nothing could change the fact that both boys found Neville’s Gran too scary for words.AHe also, as a reward for finally mastering Russian and moving onto Hindi and Welsh, added cello lessons with a master in London to his schedule.  Lady Maggie and Mycroft had self-taught him piano and composition while Sherlock worked with him on the violin.  Though Siri made jokes about the cello just being a case of Hadrian just “wanting the biggest out there”, he’d come through with one for his birthday while Remus agreed to ferry him back and forth to London for his lessons.AJohn told him when he ran over clutching his brand-new cello and the next size violin for his age that he was turning into a veritable Renaissance-Man.AThe good doctor wasn’t too far off.AHadrian’s life wasn’t without blemish.ALord Black – sickly as long as Hadrian had known his Grandpapa – had held on longer than anyone would’ve guessed.  Regrettably, he’d begun declining.  No longer able to tutor his Heir in Lordship duties, Ritual Magic, or being a Black of House Black, he’d turned his notes and journals written for such an event over to Sirius, trusting his once rebellious descendant to finish what Lord Black had begun.AThat didn’t stop Hadrian from insisting on visiting as much as his lessons and studies allowed, sitting at his Grandpapa’s beside for sometimes hours at a time as the elderly man spun his tales of the stars and the gods, even of Lady Magic Herself.  Sirius had been given control of the wards surrounding Castle Black, easing the stress on the patriarch’s magic, and together with Siger made the loving young man a two-way port-key that dropped him right into Lord Black’s bedchamber atop the highest tower in the ancient Castle.AThat marked a charmed time for the two powerhouses.  One an old tiger long weary of watching magic disappear more and more from the world.  And the other a new hope, sent to revitalize and renew his people, a gift to them from Magic Herself.AIt was over all too soon.AHadrian was leaning on his Grandpapa’s bedside, forcing back sleep, when he heard it.  The rattle.  Turning his head as he sprang to attention he spied the clock.AThree in the morning, long passed his bedtime.A“Hadrian.”  Arcturus Black called out in cracked whisper.  “Hadrian?”A“I’m here, Grandpapa.”  Hadrian answered strongly, no sign of the tears filming his eyes in his voice.  Lord Black’s vision had been one of the first casualties of his failing health.A“Let me see you, my boy.”  The dying many cracked a smile as his young Heir took his hands gently and lifted the age-cracked and spotted appendages to his face, letting them roam freely over Hadrian’s familiar features.  “My beautiful boy.  My lovely Dorea’s beloved Grandson.  There is much of my Dorea in you Hadrian.”ASightless eyes nonetheless tracked where his own emerald green would be.A“Much of her in you.”  His hands fell down onto the comforter.  “I looked to the stars once, when I was a young man, not much older than you.  I read them clearly: and well.  The best I ever did, a reading to rival that of the centaurs!”  He boasted with an old-man’s pride.  “But long did I await that future I read and mourn.  For there was no sign of it.”A“What did they say, Grandpapa?”  His voice wavered a bit under the strain of his grief.  “The stars?”AArcturus chuckled and gave a gummy smile.A“That the House of Black would give birth to the Heir of Avalon.  To the hope of all magical Nations.  That the star of the House of Black would rise high…only to fall so low it might never be reborn.  Then like a phoenix from the ashes, we would be saved.”AThe words smacked of prophecy.A“I didn’t share my reading.”  The voice strong only moments ago, wheezed.  “Not even my father or my beloved wife.  Not once in two hundred years.  Until now.”  His eyes fluttered closed before springing back open, the old man coming up on an elbow in a burst of strength and cupping Hadrian’s cheek – as if he knew where he was all along.  “I would’ve died a miserable, miserly old man, dreaming of that day, and mourning.  If not for you, my beautiful Hadrian.  My long awaited Heir.  My little phoenix.”ARelaxing back into the pillows, strength gone from him, Lord Arcturus Black closed his eyes and breathed his last at three-thirty-three in the morning on New Year’s Day, 1991.A…AWhile Hadrian was planning the funeral rites of his beloved Grandpapa, Mycroft was dealing with an issue of his own.ANowhere near as heartbreaking as a funeral…though it had the potential to become one, his, if he didn’t mind his step.  Plotting and planning the best route of attack, he finally set it all in motion the week before Prince William’s birthday on January 21st, a nondescript Tuesday the 14th of January at Sandringham House.AAndromeda was absent, still closeted in mourning with the other members of House Black as they traversed the ancient funeral rites of their Family.AThe Royal Family was arrayed in a circle in one of the cozier sitting rooms of Sandringham House, a fire blazing cheerfully behind the grate.  Present were The Queen and Queen Mother, Prince Philip, both of the young Princes and their parents Charles and Diana.  The now-eight-year-old Prince Henry – Harry to most – had been deemed old enough to learn of his brother’s secret and due to the connection with the powerful House Nimue, was carefully monitored for any sign of magical ability.AFor the moment it seemed that any power he had along those lines was latent but it could activate at any point up to eleven so the magical guards and Andromeda remained ever-vigilant.A“Ah, Mr. Holmes.”  The lovely Diana was the first of the party to notice their stoic observer.  “Please join us.”AInclining his head slightly at the Princess of Wales, Mycroft stepped into the room and bowed low before the Queen and Queen Mother who were sharing a settee – the elder working on a piece of needlepoint while the younger lightly tossed a ball to one of her ever-present and beloved Corgis.  After greeting everyone and settling into the chair offered him, accepting a cup of tea with a sliver of lemon cake from the Princess, Mycroft waited for one of the other adults to ask after his business there.  There were some subjects one didn’t just blurt out with royalty, not even in relative private.A“How is Ms. Andy doing?”  Prince Harry looked up beseechingly at the stern man, unknowingly giving him the opening he’d been waiting for.A“It’s Lady Andromeda, Harry.”  His elder brother reminded him.  “She’s from an old Family, remember?”AHarry wrinkled his nose at his brother.  It was hard enough keeping the regular nobles straight without having to remember all the magic ones now too.  Plus Ms. Andy told him to call her that.AHe knew better than to point that out in front of his father though.  Prince Charles wouldn’t be pleased over the perceived lapse in manners.  Especially with a Lady no matter who she was married to.A“Mrs. Tonks.”  Mycroft winked discretely at the youngest Prince.  “Is holding up well.  Her Head of House’s health had been of concern for many years.  Thankfully his passing was peaceful and attended by his Heir, as is proper according to the Black rituals.”A“Are they very different?”  Princess Diana asked.  “I’ve sat in on quite a few of Will’s lessons and for all the things that seem a little odd to me, many are the same.”A“I would venture.”  Mycroft answered after a long moment.  “That for the everyday witch or wizard the passing of a loved one is handled nearly identically to how you or I would deal with such an event.  However, as I’m sure young William can attest, the ways of the Olde Families and the Noble Houses would be as strange to any of you as the dark side of the moon.  Especially with what are seen as the three major milestones: Life, Marriage, and Death.”A“If Lady Andromeda needs any additional time for mourning or to see to the…Funeral Rites you called them?  Simply let Us know.”  The Queen stated, folding her hands regally in her lap.  “She has been an excellent addition to the Household, both in tutoring my grandson as well as answering a multitude of questions from the rest of our family.”A“Quite the find, Mr. Holmes.”  Prince Charles conceded.  “Though how you manage to find the perfect solution to every situation that arises never ceases to confound me.”AMycroft chuckled setting aside his cup.A“In this case no mystical powers or even extraordinary utilization of resources was necessary.”  He waved a nonchalant hand.  “As my foster-brother holds her Healing contract but no longer needed her as he once did, I both was well-acquainted with the Lady and her abilities and had possession of the knowledge that she was considering taking up teaching when not needed by her House as a Healer.  I simply hoped that you would find her as suitable as I myself did.”A“Mrs. Tonks has never mentioned the connection.”  Diana frowned lightly.  She would know as she was the one who “dropped in” on Will’s tutoring sessions.  “That is the sort of thing I would have recalled.”A“No,” The Queen faced her “government” with an arched brow.  “She hasn’t.”A“Healers under private contracts are always bound by a code of confidentiality.”  Mycroft waved it off.  “She wouldn’t be able to tell you anything about my foster-brother without breaking it.  Besides which, knowing Andromeda, she would never have mentioned it anyway as my father’s Ward is considered a member of House Black.”A“Most interesting Mycroft.”  The Queen remained undeterred.  “Though that doesn’t explain why you have requested this meeting.”A“Very well,” He conceded with a slight nod of his head.  “As we are all aware, young Prince William’s eleventh birthday is right around the corner.”A“Next week.”  William smiled charmingly at all present.  “I really, really hope I get a broomstick.  They sound wicked.”AHis relatives all rolled their eyes at the by now worn-out request while his brother simply nodded along with his brother’s words.  A flying broomstick did sound wicked.A“So I’ve been told.”  Mycroft shielded a grin with the rim of his teacup.  “However, upon his eleventh birthday he will be expected to Claim his Lordship of House Nimue and all it entails.”ASitting straight, Prince Philip calculated the distance towards the door.  They’d buried the issue of Wills’ marriage contract for the last two years, even going so far as to warn Lady Andromeda against mentioning to either her charge or the Princess of Wales.  He was not looking forward to exhuming it.A“Yes, quite.”  Charles looked towards his son.  “Following the recommendations of both yourself, Lady Andromeda, and William’s two trusted guardsmen, we’ve left the financial matters of his inheritance in the hands of the goblin Account Manager.  For dealing with the estates themselves and to help further William’s education in managing a magical estate, we’ve engaged the services of the Honorable Lord Hamish Stuart.”A“Stuart is an excellent choice.”  Mycroft nodded approvingly.  “Not overly aggressive with investments or ‘the latest thing’ but neither is he mired in the past or too conservative for the current wizarding climate.  I can only think of two better, however they are currently engaged elsewhere.”A“That seems to be a recurring theme.”  Philip commented drily, ignoring the look from his wife.AHere Mycroft couldn’t help but nod at the thinly-veiled accusation.  He’d had to play a careful game these last few years between serving the Crown, the Realm, and doing his duty by his little king.  It wouldn’t do to misstep now that the finish line of this particular footrace was at hand.AEspecially since the next was likely to prove quite entertaining.A“We’ve been informed that there are no…”  Charles waved a hand vaguely.  “Exotic requirements for the ritual Wills will use to Claim his House.  Though that a magical location was preferable and he’d need at least two witnesses of magical blood that were not immediate relations.  To that end Lady Andromeda has informed us that her cousin, a Sirius Black, has renewed their late Lord’s offer of using the nearest Black property and it’s…Circle?”  He looked towards his son to check the term, facing Mycroft once more when he received a nod.AImagine that.  Mycroft mused to himself sarcastically.  The Queen of Slytherin during her Hogwarts years had preempted me.A“Most accommodating of them.”  He nodded his head in a move only the Queen noticed was bordering sarcastic.  “Ravenscroft Hill is also an option open to the Prince if there should arise an issue between now and next week.  Did Mrs. Tonks offer witnesses as well?”A“No, now that you mention it.”  Diana set her cup down with a click.  “Which seems…odd now that we’ve discussed it.”ANot when everyone they’d offer is connected to the Prince’s future spouse.  Mycroft’s thoughts this time had a definite inner tone of snark.  No one wants there to be any sort of challenge to the legitimacy of William’s Claim.AThe tie to the mundane Crown is too valuable to risk losing it over a matter of degrees of separation.A“McG and Kings are going to stand as witnesses.”  William offered up for discussion.A“Both are from old Houses.”  Mycroft nodded in approval.  “Though neither is in the direct line of succession for the Lordships, they are very closely related to Lord Shacklebolt and Lord McGonagall.  Younger son and nephew I believe.”AMoving on.A“Once the Lordship of House Nimue has been Claimed, he will receive his invitation to attend Hedwig Institute in the Fall.  Mrs. Tonks can assist you with that process as she’s recently had a child go through it herself.  Besides the matter of his education as a Lord,” he continued.  “There are certain protocols that normally must be observed.  However in William’s case they can be…delayed for a time.  All but one.”AThe Princess of Wales pinned him with an icy blue gaze.A“And what protocol might that be?”A“That of his marriage contract.”ATo her father-in-law’s relief, no additional china was thrown at that moment…however he mostly credited that to her children being present and listening with big ears and bigger eyes.A“Marriage?”  Prince Harry asked cocking his head to one side.  Slowly but surely a devilish grin crossed his impish face.  “Will has to get married and kiss a giiirrllll….”AHe burst into giggles, nearly rolling on the floor.A“Actually, young Prince.”  Mycroft corrected, inwardly sighing.  He just knew this isn’t going to go over well…  “William’s future betrothed is a male…er…a boy.”A1…A2…A3…A“WHAT?!”A…AAfter the family had calmed and brandies were distributed – Mycroft’s go-to for calming nerves short of using a Potion – they reconvened, Prince Harry shuffled off to bed.A“Explain this to Us.”  Queen Elizabeth demanded using the Royal Plural.  The other adults all nodded, varying degrees of confusion and/or concern on their faces.AThe only Windsor that wasn’t confused was William himself, as Lady Andromeda had covered the various types of relationships, partnerships, and marriages allowed in most magical countries with him last term.A“The limitation of marriage or sexual relationships to strictly male-and-female is an entirely mundane notion.”  Mycroft said with patent nonchalance.  He sipped at his brandy.  “It rose to popularity alongside monotheism in the now-Middle East.  And as clergymen became the arbiters of justice in the Western World, their ideas on marriage and sexuality became more and more mainstream.  Their main speaking point being that as only male-female pairings could “bear fruit” they were the only acceptable types of relations.  As such is not the case in the magical world, there has never been a stigma or prohibition attached to love of any kind as long as the parties are of-age and consenting.”AWilliam nodded along with the explanation, clearly showing the information wasn’t news to at least him.A“Then, if I take your meaning correctly.”  The Queen stared at him with her perceptive gaze.  “Same-sex partnerships are able to procreate in the magical realms?”A“Quite.”  Mycroft toasted the Queen with his glass.  “Love is considered a highly-potent form of magic.  Regulating it to appease the mundane-born magicals who enter that realm has never been an option among the ruling classes of the various countries.  In fact, Avalon has an entire series of Laws forbidding such action as “against the Will and Blessings of Magic Herself.”A“Mrs. Tonks gave me a book about it.”  William supplied helpfully.  “When we covered the major Laws of the Nine Blessed during my history lessons last term.  I can lend it to you if you’d like.”A“That’s very kind of you.”  Diana smiled weakly at her son.  “Thank you, dear.”A“When we first discussed this contract.”  Charles gave his mother’s pet statesman a fierce glare.  “You made no mention of this little…detail.”A“There was no need.”  He stated unapologetic down to the soles of his shoes.  “Tempers were high and flaring and young William’s magic had only just been discovered.  Finding him a proper tutor and seeing to his protection were much more immediate needs.”A“Then why now, Mycroft?”  The Queen Mother charged him.  “Why not later, when he’s older and more mature?”A“It’s been delayed as long as possible.  As I said earlier, certain protocols are required once he comes into his full Inheritance.”  He looked from one to the other.  “I know Prince Philip was given a copy of the contract, did not one of you read it?”A“We thought,” Diana waved a hand.  “Assumed, we’d have until he was grown to worry about it.”A“Ah.”AMr. Holmes was clearly not impressed.A“Let me inform you of what has been overlooked due to that assumption.”  His voice was still within the bounds of propriety but the tone itself was glacial.  “The contract in question is from an age when wizards, especially Heirs, married young.  They still do for the most part.  As it was made between a Royal House and that of a trusted retainer who’d become Nobility through services provided the Royal House of LeFey, it specifically states that the two fulfilling it must be wedded before the Heir of Emrys is either crowned or reaches sixteen, whichever is earlier.”A“How long, My?”  Charles asked his schoolmate.  “How long until my son and heir has to wed?”A“Wed?”  Mycroft arched a brow.  “Thirteen.  He has until July to meet his intended and for his intended to initiate their Courtship and Betrothal.  Or lose his magic and possibly his life.”A“You.”  Diana stabbed a finger at his placid face, accusation in every line and curve of her body and voice.  “You knew about this.  You, you, erg!”AIt was just shy of a shriek.A“Before you start in on my good china.”  Elizabeth chided her daughter-in-law sharply, in no mood for tantrums of any kind, especially as the only one with real right to it is sitting as calmly as you please, studying one of his magic texts.  “Perhaps you will allow Mr. Holmes to finish what he has come to tell Us.”A“The Heir of Emrys will be Claiming his Inheritance,” he shot Elizabeth a significant look.  “At the end of July.  On the Fall Equinox in September there will be a grand Lordship Ball at the House of Emrys’s former main seat: Snowdon Castle hidden in magical Wales.  The new King of Avalon will be officially introduced though his coronation isn’t for another two years.  Even in the magical realm such things are a massive undertaking.  He would like to introduce yourself as his Betrothed and future Consort at that time.”AA light dawned on many royal faces.A“Wicked Mycroft.”  Elizabeth murmured, the only one well aware of his relationship to the future King of Avalon.  “No wonder you were so certain of an alliance being probable.”A“Mother?”  Charles prompted, being the only other close enough to overhear.A“When Mr. Holmes first told you of William’s magic.”  She explained briskly.  “He’d come for a reason of State as well.  As you all know the Crown holds a sort of executive authority over Our magical citizens.  However what We didn’t know until that day was Our authority was only due to the Throne of Avalon sitting empty.  So long as Avalon was without Their King, authority over Their subjects reverted to their various Ministries and individual governing bodies with oversight given to the Head of each territory’s mundane government.  In the United Kingdom that was, well is for a few more months, Us.”A“The King of Avalon is the single most politically powerful ruler in the magical world.”  Mycroft fleshed out her explanation.  “And that was when the Throne revolved between Seven different Royal Houses that had formed together over the ages to create the Empire and its territories.  With the new King-Apparent not only is he destined to be the Sole Ruler…he also holds other Houses under him, consolidating power in a fashion other Kingdoms could only wish for.”AThough Egypt and Japan certainly came close.  He mused to himself.  They’d learned well from their close friend and ally and stayed strong when their mundane counterparts crumbled under tremendous pressure that came with the great Wars.A“And young William is going to be his first Consort.”A…and there was the second explosion, right on cue.A…AWeeks later, a boy – too quickly becoming a man – turned to his brother and asked a question of the only person he could:A“My?”A“Hmm.”A“What’s my future husband like?”",The Avalon Seven,108617

WillsAAWills was sitting in an arm chair much too large for his still-growing frame, feet up on the cushion with his arms wrapped around his bent knees when he sensed something strange.AHe was dressed to impress in the finest set of Wizarding robes his tutor Andromeda could find.  She’d taken him and his mother the month after his birthday and he’d Claimed his Lordship to the magical shopping district in Paris.  He’d expected to do a bit of shopping for some formal robes and that would be that.AApparently that is not how Lady Andromeda Tonks nee Black, Daughter of the House of Black shopped.AIt didn’t help matters that in Ms. Andy’s world the Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Nimue must not be seen in something common.AWhich turned out to be everything on every rack of clothes in the entire district.AHelped along by his mother – who shared similar views on attire – Mrs. Tonks dragged him into a small, dark doorway nearly hidden among the much brighter buildings and gleaming windows.  Once inside his bad mood turned to confusion at the utter lack of clothes of any kind.  Confusion that led to hope of getting out of the whole ordeal…right up until a little man with a tape measure around his neck bustled from the back and greeted his tutor with gushing adoration.AThough some of the sting of having to stand still and imitate a mannequin for the hours it took for Wills to acquire an entire wizarding wardrobe was mollified by overhearing that this was the second time Andromeda had been to this particular tailor’s shop that week.AAnd the last time was for A Most Important Person.AIntuiting that his future-fiancé had been put through this torture as well – only with an entire entourage of guardians in tow to give opinions and use him as a dress-up doll – made him feel much better about only having to listen to Ms. Andy and his Mum.AThe best news he got that day though was that all of his clothes would be handmade and spelled with a variety of charms – including some that would allow them to grow with him – so that he wouldn’t have to be as anxious about mussing them as he was his fancy dress for State events.AAnd that he wouldn’t have to go through the whole tailor-shop-ordeal for at least a year instead of every season like with his Prince clothes.ASometimes he really loved magic.AAll those charms meant that he could scrunch himself up in his chosen hiding place and stare out the window for some peace and quiet.  His family was in a royal tizzy – bad pun aside – over the formal event taking place that evening.  He was to be introduced to his…contract…person…that he wasn’t sure what to call.AThey weren’t his boyfriend.AThat implied a level of familiarity that was completely absent since they were strangers to each other.ABut they weren’t betrothed or engaged or any of those “official” titles yet.AHe couldn’t even call…him…his Lord or King or whatever since he hadn’t Claimed his Houses yet.AThere just didn’t seem to be a proper title for this new person entering his life…not at the moment.  And for an eleven year old about to meet the person he’s supposed to spend the rest of his life with…having something to call them seemed vitally important.  Such a life-changing addition to his life should have some sort of word to describe them besides the heinously-long “Heir of the House of Emrys, Contracted-Intended of the Lord of House Nimue.”AIntended.  Wills mulled that over.  That could work.  For the next couple hours before his intended became his betrothed.  At least he’d finally settled on something…though now he had to figure out something else to obsess over to keep his mind off the fact that he was for all intents-and-purposes getting engaged at eleven.ALike whatever-the-heck-that-is that’s tingling at his senses!ALooking around, he searched the hiding places of the long gallery he’d hidden himself away in.  Extending his senses the way Andromeda and McG had been coaching him, trying to refine his ability to use his magic as an extra sense, he brushed up against something…but he had no idea what it was.  It didn’t feel like the normal culprits: McG and Kings had taken to disillusioning themselves and testing his ability to locate them.AAnd it wasn’t Harry running away from their mother who was determined that they all would put the best-foot-forward in meeting his intended and his train of guardians and retainers.AThe two Families had settled between themselves – using Mr. Holmes as an intermediary – leaving him and his intended out of the discussion – that the initial introduction would be an Introduction.AThough from what he could see it was more for the adults’ comfort with the situation being formalized and keeping it a political arrangement.  Apparently they were all sticking their heads in the sand about the part where he and his intended would have to lose their virginities to each other before they turned fourteen.  Which if they weren’t Lords in the magical world would be a massive case of underage relations.ATechnically they both became/become legal adults on their eleventh birthdays.ALittle ease to paranoid and loving guardians who would keep them kids forever if they could manage it somehow…without resorting to deAging Potions.AExtending his senses again he felt it.AJust…there!AWhipping around in his chair he jumped to his feet and looked over the back, shoes firmly on the cushion.  There staring up at him from startled crouch was the biggest and brightest pair of emerald green eyes he’d ever seen.  Hearing the rumble of voices from the hall, he turned his head towards the door as Kings called to him.A“Alright in there, Prince William?  You haven’t seen anyone wandering about have you?”ASpying from the corner of his eye the other boy making frantic motions and ducking around the side of his chair to further hide himself from the view of the doorway, William kept one eye on him and answered his bodyguard:A“Just taking a few moments for myself before the big event, Kings.  Haven’t heard a peep.”AWhich wasn’t a lie, the boy-intruder had been quiet as a mouse.A“Ok, Wills.”  Kings replied in his cheerful manner.  “Let us know if you need anything.  We’ll leave you be until it’s time.”ABoth boys waited until they heard the steps retreat from the doorway and there wasn’t a chance of being overheard.AThe other blew out a breath and stood, offering his hand genially.A“Thanks for that.”  He smiled brightly.  “It’s a madhouse out there.  I’m Hadrian, pleased to meet you…William?”AWills stared a moment before taking his hand and answering.  Hadrian was probably the prettiest boy he’d ever seen.AThose eyes would make his mother green with envy over their bright color and thick black lashes.  Ebony hair fell in soft waves from a tiny braid that kept it off his face and down his back.  His face was pure white like his Grandmother’s favorite porcelain with sharp, clear lines making it plain he was from an aristocratic family.AAnd since Wills had never met him before and the only strangers about where there for the Introduction, he had to be magic…explaining why he could sense him before he saw him.A“Pleased to meet you to Hadrian, you can call me Wills.”A…AHadrian had mutinied.AMost of the time he didn’t mind too much when his guardians turned autocratic.AThey let him make his own schedule most of the time as long as he made sure and completed all of his studies both magical and mundane and let him choose his own hobbies.AThe only place they’d ever really restricted him was with outings in the magical world and who he was allowed to be friends with.AStrictures he’d come to understand the more he studied his heritage and what it really meant to be King of Avalon both in the “King” sense and in the sense of being a monarch and sole authority in the modern age.AIt certainly wasn’t an easy job Lady Magic had saddled him with.  But it was a Blessing nonetheless and one didn’t just say “no, but thanks” to Lady Magic.  There were no returns, refunds, or exchanges on gifts from Magic Herself.ANot unless you wanted to find out for yourself what it was really like living as say…a tadpole.ABut this time he’d had it up to his eyebrows with the orders.AThe last thing a pair of awkward strangers who were magically bound to marry each other needed was a massive audience of guardians, tutors, and family watching their every move under a microscope.A Small.  He’d argued.  Quiet.  Private.AHe’d been overruled at every point.AIn the end he’d caved to the pressure from his foster family to just go along with how his elders wanted it.AOr he’d pretended to.ABut he’d not begged his uncles Siri and Remy for tale after tale of their adventures with his father as the Marauders to no effect.AHence his mutiny made possibly via a purloined bottle of brandy as a bribe to his Uncle Siri – who was supposed to be watching him but was his regular partner-in-pranking…when they thought they could get away with it.AHadrian’s plan had exploited a major issue with the whole charade he was being made to perform: him and his family/guardians/etc. arriving early in the afternoon so Papa Siger and Lady Maggie could walk through the whole thing with his future-husband’s parents.AIf they’d left him at Ravenscroft Hill he would’ve been stuck with sticking to their plan.  There wasn’t an open floo connection in either Ravenscroft or Windsor Castle, none of his family really used port-keys unless they were taking him somewhere, and he couldn’t apparate – yet.  He would’ve had no way to sneak off to the Castle short of taking the Knight Bus…and he liked being able to sit without pain to risk it.ANow sneaking away from his guardians while Siri looked the other way?AEasy as could be with a silencing spell on his shoes and a peek at a floorplan.  All he’d had to do was use his magic to search for another magical signature on its own and he’d be sure to come across his future-husband…eventually.ASeeing his…William…for the first time without Lady Maggie hovering, worried about him behaving like a Young Gentleman, was worth the lecture he was in for when he got back home later.AWilliam, Wills, was handsome with his tall, athletic frame – topping him by at least an inch and he wasn’t a short boy by any means – pairing well with his clear blue eyes and sandy-blonde hair.  Wills wasn’t as…pretty…as either himself or his Wallace friends who’s Mum had blessed them but he wasn’t unfortunately pudgy as he newer friend Neville either.  And he seemed about as thrilled as Hadrian was over the whole pomp-and-circus their elders were making of this whole thing.AAs tense as everyone was you’d think they were getting married today instead of just meeting for the first time.A“Hiding?”  Hadrian asked as Wills turned back around and sat in his chair, waving towards the other one.AWills gave him a little half-smile and a nod.  “You?”A“Same.”  He sighed.  “I don’t’ know why we had to show up so early.  All the adults are running around like crazy people, making things just so.”AThe blonde held in a snort.  “It’s been like that for days here.  Grandmother and her set haven’t been too awful but my parents are wound really, really tight.”AHadrian grimaced in sympathy.  “I know what you mean.”  Digging into a pocket for a moment, he searched for something, entertaining Wills with his obviously much-larger-than-it-seemed cache of items.  Holding up what looked like a pack of cards in triumph, he grinned.  “Found it!”  Busily opening it up, he gave the other boy a searching look.A“Ever played Exploding Snap?”AWills shook his head, tilting it to one side.  “Heard of it though, my guard mentioned it when I talked him into teaching me how to play poker.  Show me?”  He asked with a grin, coming down cross-legged on the floor facing his new friend.AThey chatted idly as Hadrian walked Wills through the game, playing in earnest once the dark-haired young wizard was sure the other understood it.A“Snap!”  Wills grinned up into bright-green eyes, face flushed with pride.  “That’s the two games to me Hadrian to your one.”A“Rub it in.”  Hadrian rolled his eyes jokingly.  “You must’ve had a good teacher.”A“Sure, sure.”  Wills mocked.  “I’m certain that’s it Hadrian.”A“Of course it is, Wills.”  His friend’s face was shockingly insincere.AThe Prince frowned.A“What is it?”  Hadrian asked with growing concern.  Things had been going so well.  Wills wasn’t a stuck-up toe-rag as his brother My had assured him, he was very nice and had taken his early loss with good humor.  He didn’t want things to get weird now.A“Well,” Wills said, clearly thinking hard.  “If I’m Wills instead of William, then you need a nickname instead of Hadrian.  That’s kind of a formal name and this isn’t a formal situation,” he arched a brow.  “Right?”A“Hmm.”  Hadrian nodded his head solemnly.  “I see your point.”A“Well?”  Wills asked impatiently.  “What do people call you besides Hadrian?”A“Ah…”  He ran one had through his dark mass of hair, blushing lightly before looking up at the other boy through his lashes.  “Promise you won’t be mad?”AWills frowned but tentatively agreed.A“Harry.”AWell that was no reason to be weird that Wills could see.A“Or King-Apparent Emrys-Pendragon.”ABlue eyes shot to green.A“Oh.”  Wills blinked at that.  That meant…AThis pretty boy who’d patiently taught him to play a wizarding card game and was hiding from the craziness was his intended.A“Well I’m not going to call you that.”  He gave the patently-worried Hadrian a bright smile.  “Not when we’re alone.  And Harry is what we call my little brother…so that’d just be weird.”AHadrian gave him one of his blindingly-bright grins.  Wills wasn’t mad at him for not telling him right away.  Hadrian still had issues over people keeping things from him after the Wallace-Contract fiasco so he might not have taken it nearly as well…a risk he was willing to take if it meant avoiding a ton of awkwardness.AWills thought hard, turning several options over in his head before coming to a decision.A“What about ‘Rian?”  He asked, head cocked inquisitively.  “It’s short like Wills but not formal or weird.”A“Ree-an?”AHis intended spelled it out for him.AThe newly-dubbed ‘Rian smiled.  “No one has ever called me that before.  I like it.”A“Wicked.”A…AAn easy hour passed, possible-crises averted, with the boys simply sitting on the floor and playing Snap.  They stayed away from the elephant in the room, talking mostly about little things like favorite foods/colors/games/subjects-at-school.  Both agreed that they were looking forward to replacing some of their tutoring hours with actual school at H.I. and were both bashfully-happy that they’d be able to be in the same class since they were both Heirs…well…Lords by the time school started.ABefore too long, Hadrian got a ping on the simple proximity ward he’d set up in the hall before making his way over to Wills’ chair.ATheir quiet first meeting was just about up.AWhich brought Hadrian to the other reason he’d turned mutineer.AWith the way things were with their contract and how their separate sets of guardians decided they wanted to handle things, Hadrian wasn’t being given the option to properly Court Wills.  If they’d been able to meet sooner they could’ve gone through the whole process, gifts and tokens and outings and all.  But that just wasn’t possible.AHadrian loathed that Wills wasn’t going to experience that.AIt rankled at both his natural honorable nature and his nurtured gentlemanly behavior.AHis guardians and tutors had worked very hard to make sure he was both Hadrian-the-Boy and Hadrian-the-King.  Neither of those were okay with skipping a very important part of choosing a spouse…even when that spouse was chosen for you.AWills wasn’t even allowed to choose Hadrian’s Cuff the way he was supposed to.  Between his station and having to have thirteen consorts, Hadrian’s Cuff – the magical cross between a wedding ring and a declaration of Status – had to be specially forged by a Master Goblin Craftsman.  Wills probably had never even seen it although he was supposed to give it to him before the night was over.AHadrian was determined that his first…well…everything wasn’t cheated out of any more important traditions than absolutely necessary.AHe sighed.  “I have to go soon.”  He said mournfully.  “I can feel my Uncle getting closer.”AWills nodded and stood, offering ‘Rian his hand and helping him to his feet.  Only ‘Rian didn’t let go right away, keeping hold of him with his own hand that was curiously both smooth and rough with calluses at the same time.  It gave him a strange feeling in his stomach, one he stored away for later inspection.A“If we were able to do all…”  Hadrian flapped his unoccupied hand flippantly.  “This the way I wanted…”A“I know ‘Rian.”  Wills smiled squeezing his hand once.  “The adults are kind of making a production of things.”AHe shook his head.  “Not exactly what I meant and so much all at the same time.”  Reaching into his expanded pocket he released Wills’ hand, holding out a sheaf of papers.  “My Courting gift to my future-husband.”  He said simply…then started to babble after Wills took it and started to track the musical notes from page to page.  “I asked My…I mean my foster-brother Mycroft about you.  What you liked, what he knew about you, he said you like music and I play music and write sometimes Sherlock says they’re good and he’d know ‘cause he’s amazing but I never know with them they can be weird about upsetting me and…”AWills gently held a finger to Hadrian’s lips, stopping the word-vomit that was spewing all over them.A“I like music.”  He said gently.  “I can’t wait to hear it.”AHadrian’s eyes lit up.  He could do that.A“Do you have your wand?”  He asked eagerly.  “I know a spell that will make the music play without needing an instrument.  Composers use it to hear the orchestration together and tweak the different parts.  I could teach you,” he looked down, turning bashful again.  “If you want.”AWay to geek out, Hadrian.  He scolded himself.  Great impression to leave him with right before he has to see you be King-Hadrian.  Fantastic.AWordlessly Wills held up the wand he’d removed from its holster under his robes, offering it to his intended along with the sheaf of music.A“No,” Hadrian shook his head and moved behind him, recalling his own casting lessons.  Though they were very different in principle since he casted wandlessly.  “It works better like this.”AReaching around Wills, looking up into his face to make sure he was comfortable with the sudden closeness, he held him tight back-to-front.  His right hand clasping the back of Wills’ over the wand and his left resting lightly on his hip.  Moving Wills’ arm like an extension of his own he spoke softly as he rested his chin on the other boy’s shoulder, watching carefully for any discomfort.A“It’s a sensory-based spell.”  His voice was very soft.  “Very much about the intent you put behind it.  You have to want to hear the music the way it was written…”  He carried on, neither boy noticing that they’d gained an audience.A…A“Clearly our Future King has spent too much time with you, Siri.”  Kingsley teased his former-partner as they peeked in on the two from around the edge of the now-open doorway.  “That was smooth as silk right there.  Reminded me of before a certain werewolf hunted your playboy-butt down.”ASirius knuckled away a fake tear.  “So proud of my little Prongslet.”AHis mate rolled his eyes and smacked him upside the back of his head.  “I can’t believe you let him bribe you into wandering the Castle.  He could’ve ended up in Timbuktoo for all we knew.”A“Really,” Kingsley slanted the mild-mannered Alpha wolf a knowing look.  “You can’t believe that Sirius Black aided and abetted an act of mischief and mild-anarchy?  Who’re you trying to fool with that, Messr. Moony.”A“Ah-hem.”  The men looked hesitantly over their shoulders only to spy a foot-tapping and arms-crossed Princess of Wales.  “Find something particularly interesting in the East Gallery gentlemen?  Like my son perhaps?”AGulping in unison they scrambled for an answer that wouldn’t have them in hot water when Remus heard something with his superior senses.  Ushering her forward, he let her have a front-row seat to the tableau.A“Remy?”  His mate asked confused.A“He’s done it.”  Remus hissed, shushing them.  “He taught the Prince the spell.  Now hush.  It’s not every day we get to hear one of his compositions.”A…AMusic flowed out all around them, leaping in gorgeous harmony off the page.AWills closed his eyes and rocked a little on his feet, smiling at the smooth, gentle dance between the piano and violin before the rest of the orchestra joined them.AOpening his eyes he smiled back over his shoulder at his intended who’d taken a step back releasing him at the first resounding note from the piano.A“You wrote me a waltz.”  Wills smiled.  “What’s it called?”A“Just,” Hadrian coughed clearing his throat with a blush.  “Just ‘William’s Waltz’, not the most original I know but it seemed to fit.”AThe music faded away then gave way to clapping from the doorway, making both boys straighten up and turn.A“Very appropriate.”  The Princess of Wales decided as she stepped into the room, giving her son’s intended a once-over.  “Even if your presence here is not.”A“Mothe…”A“Say goodbye, William.”  The Princess arched a brow, rolling right over her son’s objection.  “You’ll see each other in an hour or so.”ASeeing that she wasn’t to be moved, William turned to Hadrian – who’d been flanked by a pair of rather intimidating looking men – and bowed correctly.A“Thank you for the Courting gift, Hadrian.”A“You are most welcome, Lord Nimue.”  Hadrian’s voice was proper while managing to be improperly warm.A“Come along, cub.”  Remus ushered him out, pointedly ignoring the look-over-the-shoulder and the mouthed words.APrincess Diana similarly ignored the exchange, taking firm hold of her errant child and personally escorting him to the alcove off the formal receiving room – where he should have been all along.A…AWilliam and Hadrian’s fears were soon realized.ANot only was it An Introduction it was also An Affaire.ABoth of their Families had given in to what seemed to be a flurry of madness, pomp, and preparations that William had only seen at the Highest of State Affairs while the Ritual of it all made Hadrian think back to his only real frame of reference besides the Seasonal Rites: his Grandpapa’s funeral that he’d presided over as the next Lord Black.ATheir elders had decided upon performing the traditional Betrothal Ceremony first before anything else.APerhaps out of fear one of their lambs might suddenly decide to buck tradition and duty and object to being led to the slaughter.ARibbons hung with a festive air from the ceiling with flowers wound around them and trellises climbed up the walls in a wide array of colors with different meanings.AWhite, of course, for purity.APurple in both a deep Royal hue and one a few shades lighter for Magic Herself.ABlue for peace, green life, gold prosperity, and a pale yellow for wisdom.ATucked here and there were even threads of black, chosen in this case not for mourning or death but to offer wishes of stability to the joining of their Houses.AThe flowers were both a nod towards mundane tradition and magical beliefs with garlands of orange blossoms for eternal love and fertility scenting the air alongside those of woven together rosemary, mint, and lavender to draw friendship and constancy between the couple as well as luck.AThough neither half of the actual betrothal was much consulted about the preparations both having made it clear they thought the whole thing patently silly when they would have to undergo a formal Royal wedding at a later date, it was tradition for each to select a personal flower to represent them in the decorations.AWhich explained the painted daisies (William) and glossy magnolias (Hadrian).  Lady Maggie having a dab hand with herbology had grown both herself as was the custom as the “mother” of the event.  Diana being wholly mundane despite her family history, couldn’t take on the traditional role not having any accessible magic to aid in the growing of the flowers.ALady Maggie had never spent so much time in her greenhouses before though she acknowledged she would need to practice more so as not to exhaust herself.  Unless Hadrian forbid making a “State Affaire” of his betrothals (no matter how much he protested his weddings would remain such) she’ll be growing quite a lot of flowers over the years.  Enough for another twelve betrothals and thirteen weddings.AWhile not old for a mildly-powered witch, she and her husband due to their lower power-levels didn’t receive the same aging benefit more powerful magicals gained.  They would still live well into their fifteenth decade but the two centuries the late Lord Black had lived was likely beyond them.  That being said, both Siger and Margeaux were just reaching the “middle age” mark.AAt eighty, Siger had the energy and verve of a mundane man half is age and would still be fulfilling his former duty as “The British Government” if it wouldn’t have been a reason for talk.  He’d taken over the post from his Great-great-Uncle Lord Sheffield Holmes during the reign of the previous monarch, the Queen’s father in nineteen-forty while the country was dealing with the Second World War.  Siger spent a solid – but tempestuous – forty years in official service to the Realm before passing the position onto his heir.AMargeaux was ten years his junior and while their match was arranged by Siger’s brother, it had been a comfort to the stressed statesman even before turning into a truly loving relationship.ADespite the mild-strain on her powers, Lady Maggie was well-pleased by how the flowers turned out, the glossy magnolias setting off the orange blossoms to a lovely affect while the daisies kept the herb garlands grand company.AAn Alter had been set in the very center of the room and the normal furnishings removed, allowing four clear paths to the oaken table with the Ancient Emrys runner in watered silk, embroidered with the Emrys Crest of a crossed staff and sword, encircled by nine silver stars, all against the emerald green of the silk that took the place of the device’s field.AResting on the Alter was a hammered silver plate stamped with the Nimue Crest, flanked by a pair of closed boxes also made of oak and carved with runes for long life, protection, and truth.  Inside the boxes were the bonding cuffs which would both change upon their marriage and solidifying the bond.AStanding across from each other at the North and South positions and separated by the perfectly square alter were Remus Lupin and Andromeda Tonks.  Due to the secrecy still surrounding Hadrian and William, they were the only ones both capable of handling the magics of the ritual and without impediment due to their relationship with those to be betrothed.  Remus while as close as Hadrian’s father had no official familial bond with the future King and while Andromeda was of his blood it wasn’t a close relation beyond that of Heir and House Member.AThankfully once Hadrian Claimed his Lordships they would’ve have to make a massive Venn Diagram every time they needed a neutral party for rituals as he could call upon any of the Noble Lords and their spouses to preside in his stead.AAt precisely sundown on the Summer Solstice, Hadrian stepped forward into the ritual space from the East symbolizing that he was the “protector and strength” of the pair while William entered from the West as the “wisdom and temperance” of the match.  Both boys broke character enough to give each other a small commiserating smile before focusing on the ritual at hand.AFollowing tradition, Hadrian was wearing deep Royal purple robes with a heavy mithril men’s necklace that spanned along his collarbone from shoulder-to-shoulder and alternated between the Crests and Gems of each of his Houses.  There was a ceremonial sword at his hip sheathed in mithril with an emerald – the Gem of House Emrys – the size of an egg on the pommel.  His robes were edged with thread made through Alchemy from crushed diamond and pure gold again symbolizing purity and prosperity.AWilliam’s robes were similarly ornate though not as elaborately embroidered and with a much smaller necklace.  His robes were a gleaming platinum, marking him as a Lord of an Utmost Ancient and Noble House.  The embroidery was done in crushed aquamarine – the Gem of House Nimue – while instead of a sword he wore a sash around his hips in the light blue and silver of his House.  Around his neck hung a chain of platinum with a pendant several inches in diameter made of an etched aquamarine cabochon backed and the etchings filled with platinum in the grape vine and staff of House Nimue.AHis parents had been in awe of the jewels hidden within the Nimue jewelry Vault he’d gained access to on his birthday.  He’d gained four: the Main Vault filled mostly with coins and chests of unmounted gems and raw metals, the Jewel Vault, an Artifact Vault with special preservation charms, and a Library Vault.  Seeing it all for the first time, he was very, very glad his ancestors had had a grasp on organization.  Goblin Alderbaren had told him that many Vaults were just a massive jumbled of treasures heaped upon each other.AArrayed behind them were the members and witnesses for each House included in the contract.ATo even up the numbers due to most of the Royal Family still being in the dark regarding Wills’ status as a wizard, six members of the magical guard had been included for William including McG, Kings, and Mycroft’s distant cousin Dansford.  With the Vows Mycroft had insisted upon during the unveiling of William’s powers, including the guard wasn’t a risk for an information leak.  This actually made the order of precedence more complicated since as it was a magical ceremony the order of importance was based on their magical status – not their mundane one.AFor Hadrian that meant first came his godfather Sirius directly behind him as the Regent for House Black and his closest relation as his adoptive-father.  Flanking Regent Black were Lord Wallace and the magical Lord Holmes: each one of his guardians and a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble House.  Behind those three walked the magical Lady Holmes who Hadrian knew but wasn’t close too or much involved with, escorted by her in-laws Lord Siger and Lady Margeaux Holmes.  Behind them was Ted Tonks and his daughter Nymphadora Black-Tonks, only because her age made her behind the elder Ladies in prominence despite being a blood-relation of Hadrian’s.  Bringing up the rear were Mycroft, Sherlock, and John as the last was “merely mundane” for the purposes of the ceremony.AWilliam’s order made less sense from a perspective of station.APrince Harry came first because though he hadn’t shown magic yet he was still nominally considered the Heir of House Nimue until another Heir was born or he failed to show magic by age eleven.  Flanking him were McG and Kingsley as both were members of Ancient and Noble Houses.  Following them were Dansford and the other three guardsmen.  Then bringing up the rear were the Queen, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother, and the Prince and Princess of Wales.ACharles predictably wasn’t pleased by the implied slight but was mollified by the knowledge that Mycroft was also at the rear of Hadrian’s assembled family despite being his foster-brother.AWhen everyone had entered and created the Circle with John beside the Princess of Wales at the Northern Point and Sirius coaching Prince Harry along at the Southern, Remus began as the Priest:A“May the place of this rite Abe consecrated for Lady Magic.AFor we gather here in a ritual of peaceAWith two who would be betrothed.AHadrian and William please come forwardAand stand here before us, and before the Lady of Magic.”AThe boys took up their positions inside the circle, Hadrian at the Eastern point of the alter and William at the West.AAndromeda continued the Rite as the Priestess:A“Be with us here, O beings of the AirAWith your clever fingersATie closely the bonds between these two.AABe with us here, O beings of FireAGive them love and passion Ayour own all-consuming ardorAABe with us here, O beings of Water AGive them the deepest of trustAand the richness of the body, of the soul and of the spirit.AABe with us here, O beings of EarthALet your strength and constancyABe theirs for so long as they remain as One.AABlessed Lady of MagicAGive to these before you, we do askAyour love and protectionABlessed Be.”A“Blessed be.”  The others echoed, the Windsors having been coached previously by Andromeda in the ceremony.ARemus opened the box before William and Andromeda the one before Hadrian, revealing the Cuffs.  Taking them with careful reverence from their velvet cushions they placed them on the silver plate, holding their wands over them.  During this next part was where concessions had been made in the traditional ceremony as Hadrian was going to have multiple Consorts.ATheir Contracts required fidelity however there were clauses regarding the taking of other spouses and consorts such as the case with Hadrian’s Last of Line requirements.ASo the wording had to be very precise.ARemus and Andromeda spoke in unison:A“Place your right hands Aover these wands and the symbols of your BondAHadrian’s over Williams.AAAbove you are the stars (the ceiling had been made transparent for the Rite)Abelow you are the stonesAas time does passARememberALike a star should our bond be constantALike a stone should your trust be firmABe close, but not too closeAPosses one another, but be understandingAHave patience each with the otherAFor storms will come, but they will go quicklyABe free in the giving of affection and warmthAWith each other and the others of future bondsAHave no fear and let not the ways or wordsAof the unenlightened give you uneaseAFor the Magic Herself is with youANow and Always.”AThere was a pause then Andromeda continued alone.A“Is it your wish, William Lord of House Nimue, to become one with this Wizard?”A“It is my wish as Lord of House Nimue, to become one with the Heir of House Emrys.”  Williams’ voice was steady and true despite the heavy magic in the air that was visibly affecting the mundanes and weaker mages present.AA flash of magic and the Cuff Hadrian had personally designed for his first Consort was around his wrist, welded by the magic of the ceremony and his response into a perfect circle.  An inch-and-a-half wide it was made of platinum to denote William was of an Utmost Ancient and Noble House with a stripe of mithril running through the center for his Royal bondmate.  Along the Cuff were cabochon aquamarines and emeralds and on the underside were the etched images of the Crests of Houses Emyrs and Nimue.AIt was all at once a gorgeous piece of jewelry and a statement both of William’s and Hadrian’s respective Statuses in the Wizarding World and of the value Hadrian placed on his betrothed.  Tradition only dictated the metals and stones used, not the width of the Cuff and the amount of decoration.  By making it wider than normal for the “submissive” partner in the bond and using more than one stone each, Hadrian was putting all on notice that he highly valued his first consort and honored his bonded’s ancient House as much as his own.ALike the betrothals of old, they were legally binding.  The only difference between their betrothal ceremony and their future wedding was the amount of guests/witnesses and after their wedding they would cohabitate.  Other than that they were already bound as one.ARemus asked Hadrian the ritual question:A“Is it your wish, Hadrian, King-Apparent of Avalon, Heir of Emrys, to become one with this Wizard?”A“It is my wish as Hadrian, the King-Apparent of Avalon Heir of House Emrys, to become one with William, Lord of House Nimue.”AA small gasp went up at his adjustment from the script from those who realized the significance of it.  Like his bonded Hadrian should’ve merely stated William’s title instead of naming him specifically.  It was a political statement to his guardians that he might be going along but he would do things his way.ASuch as slipping off to meet his intended and give him a Courting gift rather than keeping the situation purely political.AHadrian was once more starting to buck the traces but in a much different way than his brief months of temper tantrums and sulks at seven.ANow he was turning into the man and King they’d raised him to be – only with that came his own opinions and ideas for how things should be.AThe second Cuff clasped itself around Hadrian’s lean wrist, William peeking to get a better look at it.  As another step outside of tradition, Hadrian had had to have a special Cuff to deal with all his bondings.  Rather than try and force him to wear thirteen different Cuffs or attempting to weld them into one at a later point – highly difficult if not impossible due to the magic of the bonding ceremonies – this Cuff too had been custom-made by the goblin smiths.  Lord Ragnarok had overseen the entire forging and embellishment process personally as a courtesy to his fellow ruler.ATwo inches wide – the widest a Cuff can be without seeming overblown – it was forged of plain, unembellished or embossed mithril.  Thirteen oval frames were set into the quarter-inch-thick metal, each currently containing the Crest of one of Hadrian’s Houses – except where the Emrys Crest should be in the top-center of the band.  There instead was a cabochon aquamarine that like the jewels on William’s Cuff would instantly turn into a flawlessly faceted gem upon completing their marriage ceremony.AThe spellwork woven into the Cuff was a massive undertaking to accomplish what was required.  The Cuff had to be able to differentiate between a Courtship, Betrothal, or Marriage and respond for the correct House consort at the right time.  For example, though no one was present to see it, when Hadrian gave William a Courtship gift of an original composition, the Crest of House Emrys had shifted into that of House Nimue only to turn itself into a cabochon aquamarine hours later.AAndromeda closed the ceremony:A“As Cuffs have been exchanged and vows given, I now proclaim this Bond as Sealed.”  She hesitated a moment causing both young men to eye her curiously when she stopped.ARolling his golden-flecked eyes Remus said what she wouldn’t, not afraid of risking the wrath of the guardians or his cub over it.A“You may now kiss your Bonded.”  He charged Hadrian, bringing a blush to light both their cheeks.ASeveral of those present – and not just William’s family members – made to object only to be silenced by those near them with firm looks.AIt was needed to Seal the Bond and Close the Rite.ABlushing fiercely over the audience, Hadrian quickly moved to Wills’ side never dropping his hand.  Stretching up slightly as his Bonded was a little taller than him, he pressed a firm but gentle kiss on Wills’ light pink lips.  Mouth resolutely closed – no matter what David and Dora had told him about kissing – he lingered for a moment over how soft the sensation was.  He never knew lips felt like that, wondering briefly if his own felt the same to the bright-red William.AStepping back he squeezed Wills’ hand once encouragingly as the magic that had kept their hands sealed tightly together released them and the heavy pressure in the air dissipated, the lit candles at the four corners of the alter extinguishing themselves.ABefore Mycroft could step forward to handle the introductions, he was cut off by a furious blonde making her way full-steam-ahead towards Remus who was busy sending the Ritual tools back to their Family Vaults with a few flicks of his wand.AIt wouldn’t do for the priceless heirlooms to be damaged because someone spilled a piece of the ceremonial cake – or worse wine.AElf-wine was a bitch to get out of acromantula-silk without damaging the spellwork.A“Kissing?!”  Diana hissed at the startled werewolf.  “No one said anything about kissing!  What did you think you were playing at, sir?”  She sneered.ARushing to prevent a possible disaster of Hadrian-proportions, or worse Marauder-proportions, she found herself quickly flanked by Mycroft Holmes and Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mycroft intending to prevent the former and Kings the latter.ARemus paid them no mind, merely arching a brow at the mother-wolf facing him down.  Even Moony could respect her trying to protect her cub.  A cub that was being quietly teased by his younger brother as his mother was occupied elsewhere and not able to save him from the pest.A“A ritual Kiss was required to Seal the Bond and Close the Ritual.”  He answered the accusation patiently.  “If I hadn’t instructed them as such, they’d have their hands welded together until doomsday and all of the non-magicals present would’ve passed out from the pressure of the old magic.”ADiana growled low in her throat.AThe Alpha sent an arch look at Prince Charles as he came up behind his wife, recognizing the Heir to the Throne from his mother’s mundane newspapers.ACasting for a scent he located Andromeda tucked safely away with her husband and child.  Traitor.A“You were supposed to be informed.”  He said finally.  “By Mycroft if no one else.”  Remus was no fool and shamelessly through the British Government under the bus.AIt helped that he was already in it’s path by trying to cut the Princess off.AMycroft could’ve killed the damned mangy wolf for that.  Instead he changed the topic completely, shifting to grab his littlest brother by the arm and subtly dragging him over to meet the Queen.  Leaving the stewing Diana to be dealt with by her husband.A“No trailing list of titles.”  Hadrian hissed at his smirking brother, overheard by an entertained Queen and her mother and husband.  “This is my Bonded’s family not the leader of a sister nation at the moment.”A“No fun.”  Mycroft complained lightly.  “No fun a’tall.  What good are all those titles if I don’t get to needle you with them whenever possible.”AWills manfully swallowed a chuckle as his grandfather grabbed him and hauled him into the impromptu receiving line.  With narrowed eyes and that hiss ‘Rian was giving quite the angry-kitten impression.ASpotting the action, the rest of the gathered – bar the guardsmen who had already returned to their posts save Kings who was on Wills-duty – arranged themselves appropriately for their introductions.AIn this at least Prince Charles’s sense of “how things should be” was appeased since as the Queen was a sitting monarch and William a confirmed Lord, Hadrian was introduced to them and not the other way around as it would’ve been had the ceremony taken place two months later.A“Your Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of England, may I introduce the King-Apparent of Avalon: Hadrian Augustus Emrys-Pendragon, Heir of House Emrys and Bonded-Betrothed of the Lord of House Nimue.”A…AIt had been decided – again not by them – that with Hadrian’s Claiming barely more than a month away the two betrotheds could wait to get to know each other better until they started H.I. in the Fall and their officially introduction to the Wizarding World as King and Bonded-Betrothed.ANeither young man was pleased, feeling as if the adults in their lives were on the one hand expecting them to be adults and Lords and make decisions as such but at the same time trying to manage them like they would any other eleven-year-old.ASomething was bound to break.AIn the meantime things had returned to normal at Windsor Castle with the exception of a soon-familiar owl winging it’s way to the Prince’s quarters at all times of the day and night and Andromeda adding lessons on what was expected of a the Bonded-Betrothed of a Lord and of a King to William’s schedule.AAnd yes, to William’s dismay, there were differences between the two.AA dismay that was brightened by a letter from Hadrian complaining about his own Bonded-Betrothed lessons.AMost occasions would call for Hadrian to be the dominant party in public however there were a few where William as the Lord of House Nimue was superior to even a King, all dealing with matters of his House.AFor one thing Hadrian would never be able to approve or assign marriages for members of House Nimue even if they were his own children.ANor could be contract or ratify an alliance between his Bonded’s House and another.ALittle things to most people but important for the pride and self-esteem of William who’d been raised to rule from the cradle and was now mostly relegated to being a Consort until he assumed the Throne of England – hopefully decades away.AAs his birthday approached, Hadrian’s letters and replies became shorter as his time was stretched thin by preparations of all kinds.  While Claiming his Inheritance was a relatively simple Ritual there was a whole lot of baggage that came with it.  Not the least of which was finding out where Avalon was actually located and activating the Ward stones that were supposed to protect the Kingdom and its Territories.AWithout a King to charge them and ambient magic from the accompanying Household(s) to keep them powered, the Wards surrounding Avalon’s interests had weakened considerably.AThe air-raids on London during WWII being an excellent example of a tragedy that would’ve been mostly averted if they were fully-powered.  Great tracts of land that mundanes in the Avalon territories had built on actually belonged to the Empire and as such were under It’s aegis.  While not all of it had simply been seized by mundanes, much of it had without the proper patents for usage from Avalon.ABalmoral Castle in fact stood on land gifted to the mundane Royals through an Avalonian patent.AHadrian was not amused by the blatant land-grabbing that the various Ministries of Magic – charged with administering Avalonian rule in Their Territories – had allowed to go on.AAnd while he wasn’t about to boot all the squatters off of his land and use the Wards to keep them out, he was going to demand concessions from the ruling governments that were responsible.AIn addition to dealing with that major problem, his guardians and later Hadrian himself when he was old enough, had begun a thorough review of the Laws that had been enacted in the absence of a King.  Not. Amused.AAll totaled they had decided on splitting the issues and the needed and necessary reforms into seven categories for each territory:  Administration (usually Ministry of Magic), Legislative body (i.e. Wizengamot), Legislation processes, Judiciary issues, Current Laws and regulations, Taxation and Spending, and finally Education.ASome countries had barely a sheet for each, such as India which under their Governor had maintained the same policies as the last appointed Viceroy for the Kingdom and House of Slytherin had enacted unless they were policies that needed changing to keep up with the times.  Of all the Seven Houses, Slytherin’s Kingdom had flourished the best without a King in Avalon.  The others…AIt was hit, miss, miss so bad you couldn’t find it or summon it with an accio.ARussia for instance was mostly fine it just needed an update in their administrative policies following the upheaval of the mundane governments over the last century.AHadrian pretty much wanted to toss Britain out and start from scratch.AIt probably would’ve been easier than dealing with the mountain of issues they found.AAnd that was before Gringotts completed the ordered audits of each and every functioning government under Avalonian rule.AThough calling Britain “functioning” was being kind since that was about all it did.AThe only area that seemed to work in the slightest way was the education system and even that needed massive upgrades and changes to regain the Top School position it had lost in the last fifty years.AAt one point right before his birthday Hadrian had a dream that he was literally drowning in paperwork and dusty tomes filled with statutes.ADespite all the headaches and glasses of butterbeer and brandy, seven years of work came to a head on the night of July 31st, 1991.",The Avalon Seven,108617

Not until you’re like thirty.  Maybe older.)AAASo that’s probably a bunch of it.AAAMrs. Tonks hasn’t been a cakewalk herself as far as lessons go.AAAApparently I wasn’t versed well enough on the

impossible to beat.AAAYours,AAAWillAA…AHead in his hands, Hadrian stared down at the list in front of him.AHe didn’t need to be thinking about this now, strictly speaking.ABut he’d just sat through a meeting at Gringotts discussing the coming hand-off of accounts and duties because of Lord Wallace taking his place as Avalon’s Lord High Steward on his Privy Council and his current Head of Accounts also moving up to be the Lord High Treasurer.  With both of them leaving his personal service for service to the Throne of Avalon, that left him with some issues to think about.  Thankfully who was going to manage his personal estates and assets wasn’t on that list.ALord Tristan Bolyn of the Aged and Honorable House of Bolyn had been thoroughly vetted and interviewed before undergoing an Unbreakable Vow similar to the ones Gawain had taken a couple years previously.  He would be joining the Royal Household after Hadrian’s birthday as his Steward, taking Gawain’s place in managing his personal estates.  Which was basically his entire landed inheritance.  Gawain would look after the Throne’s interests, basically a headache of a position involving oversight of the various Ministries and how they administered the land and estates of the Kingdom itself.AAHead  Ache.  One that Hadrian was ecstatic to leave in Gawain’s hands even if he does end up persuing Masteries in Law and Finance the way he thought he might.ARemus had suggested those as highly valuable Masteries for a ruler and he had to agree.  Plus while the Finances lessons were tedious, he really enjoyed the wheeling-and-dealing aspect and the arguing and debating involved with Law.ATristan was only a third of the equation.  Another third was selecting a goblin to take over as Hadrian’s Head of Accounts with Ragnok’s promotion to keeping an eye on the Ministries’ expenditures and funds management.  Most of the audits were fine, just in need of some pruning here and spending there but Britian’s was ugly.  Ragnok’s apprentice had proven himself with the Evans Accounts and so gained the Potter and Black ones as well as oversight over his accounts as a whole.  The five other goblins who managed the remaining ten accounts would continue to do so…just with a new supervisor.AIt was the remaining third appointment that was giving Hadrian a migraine.AHe had to pick a chatelaine.AAnd not just one.AHe needed a main or Head chatelaine who would technically work for both himself and the Throne, taking charge of both his personal as well as the royal properties and managing the legions of house elves that came with them.  Whoever he appointed would be charged with making sure that all of his properties (and he’d seen the consolidated list that was a lot of houses, castles, palaces, cabins, and retreats) as well as the royal ones were ready to be inhabited at a moment’s notice.  That meant inventorying all of them and replacing what was needed in fabrics, furnishings, dinnerware, silverware, cooking appliances, and the list went on.AIt was a massive task.AThat he also needed another eight chatelaines to work under the Head to manage each of the official “countries” of Avalon’s homes as well as a territorial chatelaine was a total of nine women he had to find and raise to positions within the Royal Household.  Less if a few of them could handle more than one area.AHis first idea was Lady Maggie and she just chuckled, patted him on the cheek and told him he was “such a dear for thinking of her.”ANot that he could blame her, he didn’t want the job either.AHadrian at the least needed his Head Chatelaine selected an installed directly following his birthday.  Otherwise she wouldn’t have enough time to get Snowdon Castle in order before the Ball and Avalon’s Skye Palace would need seeing to as well…since that was supposed to be his main residence…if he ever figures out where Skye Palace is.AAndromeda and Ted had already agreed to fill the positions of Royal Healer and Mind Healer so no issues there, a Secretary was in the process of being vetted heavily by both Mycroft and Sherrinford, and he’d made plans to…appropriate one of the guardsman he’d met at Windsor Castle for his own Captain-of-the-Guard.AThat only left him with needing a Potions Master for the Royal Household in addition to the “Chatelaine Dilemma” and the empty slots on the Privy Council not being taken by one of his trusted guardians and advisors.  So, you know, no worries.AJust the “little” problems that came with becoming King.AAnd those were just domestic issues.A…ATwo days before his Claiming Hadrian had acquired a Secretary and was closeted with the Honorable Russell Davies, second son of the Honorable Lord Davies, going over a few of the still-murky appointments he needed to make.AOfficially the members of the Privy Council wouldn’t be announced until the night of his Lordship Ball but while some were easy: Wallace as Lord High Steward, his Papa Siger as Lord High Ambassador, Mycroft as Mundane Liaison to the Throne, others were not.AMost of the trouble stemmed from the thirteen Lordships.ATraditionally Lord Potter would be the Lord Protector, Lord Pevensie the Lord of the Privy Seal, Lord Peverell as High Magister, and Lord Valerius was the Lord High Justice of Avalon.AAll titles he now held.APlus Wills as Lord Nimue should be the Lord Chamberlin but he was his Bonded Betrothed and Neville Longbottom who should be the Lord High Constable was underage and the Dowager Longbottom wasn’t eligible to hold the office as she wasn’t of Longbottom Blood.AIt was turning into as big of a nightmare as the Chatelaine miasma.AAnd he still needed a Potions Master to the Royal Household.ARussell and Tristan were determined to help their soon-to-be Lord and King solve these issues.  Both were from a younger generation that separated Sirius, Remus, and Andromeda from the Lords Holmes and Wallace, which helped broaden the pool of candidates considerably as they had some names in mind that wouldn’t occur to either set.AHadrian underlined a name on the complete list of supposedly eligible Lords, Ladies, and Noble-born children.  It was quite comprehensive.  So much so in fact that in the beginning it had only made his head ache worsen.ARemus pursed his lips, determined not to say anything.  If his cub was really considering him for a position there had to be a reason.  One he’ll never hear if he shoots it down immediately.  Harry still listened to himself and Mycroft despite the young man’s older guardians despairing over him growing hard-headed after his self-dubbed “Mutiny” before and during his betrothal ceremony.AAs far as he and the younger men were concerned (they being the Holmes brothers, John, Sirius and Ted) Hadrian was simply trying to do what they’d been training and coaching and teaching him to do all this time: rule.AIt was as if the older guardians were channeling Dr. Frankenstein: they made a “monster” from a hodgepodge of pieces (honor, duty, service, pride, power, etc, etc.) and then watched in equal parts awe and horror over that which they’ve created.AJames and Lily would be so proud at Hadrian finally coming into his own instead of just going along.ABut as the younger men hadn’t been open in their disapproval – if indeed they felt any at all – Hadrian still relied on them for advice and then actually took it under consideration instead of the “humoring” tone and stance he took with the elders.AHis cub underlined another name and then another with his fountain pen – a reciprocal Courting gift William sent him with both of their nicknames engraved on the shaft – some in black ink others in red.AAs he worked, Tristan had a look of understanding wash over his leanly-attractive and suntanned face.  Tristan had the handsome face that won one of his squib ancestresses a Crown – and then cost her her neck – paired with the stocky brawler’s build of the men of his maternal line, the Smiths with their same blue eyes and russet hair.ARussell on the other hand didn’t take much from either of his families.  His eyes were a plain, uninteresting hazel matching the medium-ash-brown hair on his head.  Neither handsome nor plain, thin nor fat, short nor tall, he would’ve made an excellent spy with his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to blend in anywhere.AHadrian of course had taken well to both of them after several meetings and the taking of Vows and Oaths – both to himself personally and to his position.AHe would never chance a repeat of the fight with Lord Wallace again.A“You believe the story of the Imperious?”  Tristan asked carefully, seeing the connection between the two names underlined in red.A“Not for a moment.”  Hadrian set the pen in its ebony holder embellished with silver-leaf.  “But I do believe that between my Conquest of the Slytherin Line and the ambitions of these two men I can make could use of them.”A“That could be, cub.”  Remus stroked the light goatee he’d recently grown.  “But how could you ever be sure of their loyalty?  Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape were considered to be Voldemort’s right-and-left hands.”A“The same way their dreaded Lord was.”  Hadrian smirked.  “Through a Mark.  He was hardly the first liege-lord to Mark his followers, it’d simply fallen out of use since ancient times.  Remove his Mark and bind them tightly with the right Vows and a Mark to hold them and they’ll be more loyal to me than they ever were to him.”  He sneered.  “After all, I have no need of women and children to use as hostages over my people.”AHighly uncomfortable with the topic though he knew he might be privy to more of the same during his tenure, Russell changed the subject.A“What of the rest?”  He asked mildly.  “Armand du Lac, Sandringham Bones, Amelia Bones, Garrick Ollivander,” he raised a brow.  “Sirius Black and Remus Lupin?”A“Cub,” Remus growled low.  “I’m a werewolf and Sirius is an ex-convict no matter that he was wrongfully imprisoned.  Neither of us are appropriate members of the Privy Council.”ANor was Remus a Noble but he wasn’t going to get into that argument again especially with an audience lest he threaten to ennoble him…again.AThe thought of it made his neck itch.  Bad enough he was mated to a high-born he didn’t want to be one himself.A“You don’t say?”  Hadrian gasped in mock-shock.  “I had no idea after all these years…”A“Cub.”AThis time the growl had a rough warning edge to it.AHadrian sobered, squaring his shoulders.A“In the Royal Charter Section Five: the Formation of a Privy Council, it clearly states that if the traditional holder of a Privy seat is ineligible for any reason the King may fill it as His Pleasure.  In subsection seven paragraph four there is no mention of lycanthropy being a disqualifying disease and in subsection seven paragraph nine it clearly states that only those “Rightfully Convicted of Offenses” are ineligible for a Privy seat.  Therefore I can make you my Lord Protector and Siri my Lord High Constable…and there’s nothing you can do about it.”AThe so there was absent but implied.A“We can refuse to accept.”A“Until my birthday when I make it a Royal directive and you’re forced to accept or be labeled Traitors to the Throne.”  Hadrian’s grinned was total Padfoot.  “But why go through all that when you know Uncle Siri is going to say yes and then follow you around with puppy dogs eyes until you cave so that way he doesn’t have to be on the Privy Council all alone with Luscious Lucius Malfoy.”ATristan just blinked.AThat wasn’t even manipulation, that was blatant blackmail.AWere they sure he was only eleven?A“Where did you hear that name?”  Was all Remus could say.  “Lucius swore the entire school to silence after that round of spin-the-bottle Slytherin vs. Gryffindor.”AHadrian chuckled to himself.  Did Uncle Remy really think Siri limited his stories to pranks when there was so much blackmail material over current sitting Lords over what happened in those Prefect meetings?  Though he could’ve done without hearing about the dare that led to the conception of Bill Weasley…AAnd that Lucius Malfoy had merely settled for Narcissa Black when he was really attempting to seal a Courtship contract for the then-Heir.AThere was no way Remus would allow his mate anywhere in close quarters with the blonde who regularly topped “Witch Weekly’s” Hot-Wands list.AGold-tinged eyes glared at him balefully.ATwo less Council seats to worry about?  Check and mate.A“When and where would you like me to arrange your meetings with the Council prospects?”ARussell thought it best for everyone if they could please Merlin finish with this topic of conversation.A“Most can wait until next week.”  Hadrian decided with a nod.  “But with my birthday the day after next I need to see Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy tomorrow.  Confer with Griphook and arrange one of their magic-neutral meeting rooms, not their best, I don’t want to seem like I’m showing off with Potions Master Snape’s history with my parents hanging over us.”AHis secretary nodded distractedly, quickly penning notes in his ever-present folio.  “Who should I tell the Head Account Manager to expect and how would you like the requests worded?”ARemus cleared his throat sharply, arching a brow.A“Not in the meeting, Moony.  Not with your history with both of them.  This is hard enough to manage without adding in unnecessary distractions.  No you and no Siri.”A“Who then?”  His eyes flashed pure gold.  “You cannot meet them without a guard.  I don’t care if it costs you your plan.  You will take a guard or you will not be going.”A“That’s what I have a Captain of the Guard for.”  Hadrian grinned innocently.  “McG should be here later tonight and will be staying until the Royal Household moves to either Skye Palace in Avalon Proper or to Snowdon Castle in Wales.”A“You stole your Betrothed’s guardsman?”  Remus gave him a Look.A“Not stole.”  He shrugged completely unapologetic.  “Appropriated and gave a promotion.  With Wills about to spend days either at H.I. with me or being tutored in his general education studies he doesn’t need two guardsmen around the clock.  Dansford is moving one of the newer Hit Wizards assigned to the Royal family onto Wills when he’s in residence with the rest of his family and making Kings his bodyguard outside the royal residences.  It’s all been arranged and Wills understands especially since he’ll still be able to see McG when he’s visiting me and after our marriage.”AThe Captain of the Magical Guardsmen for the Windsor family Dansford had been quietly assigned a few extra men after it’d been revealed to Lady Amelia Bones, who’d taken over as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement after the scandal of Sirius’s false imprisonment had rocked the Department to its very core.  Crouch had been quickly cast from the Ministry, thrown to the wolves to appease the public after two very damaging scandals.ALady Bones had proven herself to be a stalwart crusader in the pursuit of justice, leading Hadrian to consider her seriously for the office of Lord High Justice of the Kingdom of Avalon.AThe Alpha werewolf grumbled a bit as he sat back, not quite appeased but having his major concern soothed.A“As for wording,” Hadrian got back on point.  “How about something along the lines of: The King-Apparent of Avalon requests the presence of (Lord Malfoy/Lord Prince) for a Meeting.  For Lord Malfoy make it regarding his position on the Hogwarts Board of Governors and for Lord Prince regarding the Marriage Contract.  Use the official seal of House Emrys and the Obligatio Parchment.”AObligatio Parchment was strictly made and regulated by the goblins for usage in their official summons for business of the highest importance.  The only people given a patent for usage outside of Gringotts were the Royal Houses of various countries who were on good terms with the Goblin Nation.ASuch as the Kingdom of Avalon.ASeverus Snape would recognize the potion used to treat the parchment and give it its legendary binding power while Lucius Malfoy would see the binding as a statement of power.AIf the inherent binding of the parchment wasn’t enough to get them to the meeting, their curiosity would take care of it for him.A…A“Explain this to me, Hadrian.”ASirius’s voice was dark and cold, forcing Hadrian to lift his head from the difficult translation he was working on for his Ancient Runes lesson the next day before his meetings.AFire raged behind storm-grey eyes as the subject of their rage closed the book laying on the desk before him with a snap.A“Who else would make a better Lord High Constable…”  He began only to be cut off when a callused, tattooed hand slammed onto the desk.A“Don’t fuck with me, Harry.”  His godfather’s words were a nearly inaudible rasp.  “I don’t give a shit about being Lord High Constable or Remy being your Lord Protector or you being the King-of-ruddy-Avalon.  I’m talking, as a man, to the young man who is my godson.  Now tell me.  What are you playing at?”ATheir gazes clashed in a titanic battle of wills while the very air seemed to still.AEventually after several moments Hadrian simply knew he was going to win.  And if he did he stood a decent chance of losing his godfather while he was at it.  He’d still have a Regent Black and a Lord High Constable but not his godfather.  This was one of those moments where you lose, not because you’re weaker but because the price that came with winning was more than you wanted to pay.AStanding he motioned silently for Siri to follow him, leading him down the hall to a room he’d never been in before.  Once they’d stepped inside and Hadrian had sealed the door behind them, he spoke a Word and the cavernous room lit up.  It was clearly a magically expanded Wizarding Space and they were standing on a balcony catwalk high about the floor.ASirius canted his head from side to side trying to figure out what seemed familiar about the space below him but couldn’t place it.AThen Hadrian waved his hand and suddenly the connection he couldn’t quite grasp slammed into place.  It was a giant chessboard.ABut…not all at the same time.AInstead of two sides there were four, all connected at the center.  And the squares weren’t all white and black nor did there seem to be a uniform number of pieces or even types of pieces.AThe animagus couldn’t make heads or tails of it.A“Imagine the current Cold War going on as a giant chess match.”  Hadrian’s voice spoke eerily into the silence of the massive chamber, the pieces marching to their starting points at the sound.  “On one side you have Dumbledore.”AThe White King changed to a view of a kindly-grandfather type seated on a would-be throne with a phoenix on his shoulder.A“The other Voldemort.”AThe Black King shifted turning into the snake-face effigy of the man who terrorized thousands, a viper wrapped around his shoulders as he stood tall and defiant.A“Many of them lost pieces: pawns and higher valued alike in their first confrontation and now they’re attempting to regain followers before the next salvo.”APhantom figures of wizards, witches, and magical creatures of all kinds fought and fell in the empty open space between the two stationary would-be Kings.A“Now that peace has reigned for a time, the salvo draws near.  But while they recovered other fronts arose.”ATwo new sides – one in emerald and one a mottled mess of white, black, and emerald rose, marching into place.A“On one hand are the common people, the ninety percent that honestly don’t give a damn about who’s in charge as long as they have food on the table, their children are safe, and magic still runs in their veins.  Most of these are pawns, they have no real King to order them into battle, and most of their loyalties sway with the changing of the wind.”AA massive set of pawns stretched back into the shadows, a few higher-level pieces scattered among them.A“Then there’s me: the King of Avalon in two days’ time.”  The emerald King shifted into a slightly older version of the boy beside him, still narrating in that eerie voice.A“Dumbledore believes he has a spy in Voldemort’s ranks, though they each value him and play him differently and you never know what color he’s going to choose to serve at any given time.  Voldemort treats him as his right-hand, to him he’s valuable, versatile, and extremely dangerous.”AThe Black Queen shifted into a sallow-faced man with black hair, his cloak splitting turning half-white and half-black.A“Our venerable White King values him differently.  Oh, he’s still valuable but expendable.  Powerful but not overly so.  Though very, very versatile as any successful spy must be.”  A White Knight gained a Black base.A“Now the Black King has dozens of pawns to call up while the White King has few.”  A double line of pawns advanced to the front of the Black side while a sparse single line made their way to face them from their side.  “And ten of his most powerful pieces are imprisoned while others are missing.”ABars shot up around ten pieces – a variety of knights, bishops, and rooks while others a combination of paws and rooks faded in and out of existence, there one moment and gone the next.A“And at the King’s left hand is another piece, capable, charming, and above all cunning.”  A piece somewhere between a Queen and a Bishop gained Lucius Malfoy’s long blonde hair.  “One never knows it’s next move or where it’ll strike.”A“And then there’s the White King’s pieces: a decent assortment and all highly powerful.”  Knights, bishops, and rooks took the field.  Sirius thought he saw a Knight with Flitwick’s face and a Bishop with Minerva McGonagall’s.  “But the piece he prizes and covets above all else?  His Queen.  An extremely powerful piece that he sent – or so he thought – to be broken and forged and broken again.  Dumbledore would hate to lose his prized weapon…but he would if it meant saving himself or victory.”ASirius was unsurprised to see the Queen gain Hadrian’s face though not entirely correctly.  There were ugly glasses perched on the soft face and livid scars standing out on the bared arms and forehead.A“The White King thinks he controls his Queen but in reality it’s not his to command at all.”AA sheen of emerald shimmered just under the white and the emerald eyes of the statue flashed.ACocking his head, Hadrian waved his hand and the emerald pieces formed up – though in reversed order, the pawns behind the high-value pieces.A“Now our beloved emerald King as in theory hundreds and thousands of various pawns and more powerful pieces at his command – but they won’t fight for him.  Not yet.  He has to prove himself worthy of service before they will join his side.”  Several pieces from the mottled and white sides moved to flank those of the emerald but with a clear line between them.  “The emerald King has powerful pieces beyond that: Knights, Bishops and Rooks.”A“But no Queen.”  Sirius commented seeing his own face supplant that of a Knight standing shoulder-to-shoulder with his Mate’s Bishop.A“No Queen.”  The emerald-eyed youth echoed with a small nod.  “But.”  He arched a brow.AGetting a feel for the magic in the room, Sirius waved a hand.AAs one the Knight-Severus and Queen-Severus deserted their Kings, the mishmash-Lucius following at his back, the Knight and Queen merging into an Emerald Queen as the mishmash-piece did the same.  At a flick of his wand the White Queen gave a devilish smirk and disappeared under a Cloak.  A final flick had many of the emerald’s-in-waiting shifting over – and changing their colors to Hadrian’s.A“It will be quite the coup.”  Sirius had to allow with a sigh.  “In one move you steal Voldemort’s two most powerful supporters, undercutting his power base severely when the Knights and others realize they’ve deserted the field for another camp.  And swiping at Dumbledore in the process as it’ll cost him more than just Snape if he defects.”  Then he asked the pertinent question.  “But is it worth it?  Having tea and crumpets with Death Eaters just to gain a few more pieces in a game you didn’t even start?”A“I don’t know yet.”  Hadrian admitted, worrying his lower lip between straight white teeth, canny eyes studying the board.  “But the game is set.  The only question is: Am I willing to show up?  Or do I leave my people, all my people to their fates?”  The young ruler shook his head.  “I’m not willing to possibly cost the lives of hundreds or thousands of people, my people, because a pair of assholes decided to turn magical Britain into their chess game.”A“So you’re going to make it your game.”  Sirius finished with a sigh.A“And make up the rules as I go along…if I have to.”A“I hope you know what you’re getting into with those two.”  Sirius shook his head and closed his eyes tightly, pinching his nose between his thumb and fingers.  “They’re two of the best and brightest minds to ever study the Dark Arts.  That might be one rabbit hole you won’t make it back out of if they start playing their games with you.  It’s a humongous risk.”A“It’s a risk I have to take.”  Hadrian gripped with rail until his knuckles turned white.  “Death Eaters or not.  Murderers or not…they’re too valuable to simply relinquish them to another without even making an attempt at bringing them into my service.”A“I wish you luck, kiddo.”  Sirius clapped him on the back.  “I really do.  Because I’m piss-poor at chess and even I know that’s one hell of an opening gambit.”A…AADear Wills,AAASo…AAAI almost died by enraged-animagus today.  I’d been making plans all day with new my staff and unwinding with some mindless homework when

House Malfoy was as stoic and icy as ever, not one iota of his inner tension and turmoil showing on his handsome face.  He paused for a split-second as he caught sight of the back of his best-friend and sometimes-rival Severus Snape waiting impatiently at the Welcome Desk that was Lucius’s own destination.  While it was an open-secret that Severus was the Lord and Head of House Prince, almost no one treated him as such – which was exactly as the taciturn Potions Master wanted it.AIn fact, the only time before he could recall seeing Severus arrayed like the Lord he was instead of as a simple Brewer in his Potions Robs was for the Wiccaning and Blessing of his godson, Lucius’s own Heir Draconis.  The Wiccaning of Lucius’s twin godchildren Octavian and Livia born of Severus’s late wife was before he’d gained the Lordship as they were a good two years older than Draco.AHe had to admit, cataloging him with a canny eye, that if Severus flaunted his status more often he would probably have women throwing themselves at him – and not just to become Lady Prince.  His friend carried off the fine clothes in the Prince colors of dark Roman blue and oyster-grey well with his lanky body and stern features.  He’d even deigned to rinse that horrible Potion that protected his hair from cauldron fumes from his fine black hair.ABut then, Lucius smirked as his friend turned.  One doesn’t meet the future King of Avalon with greasy hair.AEven the snarky Snape wouldn’t go that far in his stubborn refusal to conform to convention.A“Severus, my friend.”  Lucius clasped arms with the taller man.  “Enjoying your summer away from the Castle?”A“Indeed.”  Severus gave a smirk.  “At least my own children aren’t complete dunderheads.  Though Draco…” he pretended to sigh regretfully and shake his head.A“There’s no need for that.”  Lucius gave a small sniff.  “My son is turning out quite enamored of potions thanks to your tutalege.  If anything I’m sure it’s a relief from irritants who don’t know one end of a stirring rod from the other.”A“Quite.”  Lord Prince barely held himself back from rolling his eyes.A“Gentlemen.”  A goblin stood in the archway leading back towards the innards of the bank.  “Follow me.”ALocking eyes for a brief moment they turned in unison and trailed sharply after the guide who stopped before one of the “neutral” meeting rooms though both knew it wasn’t the largest nor most comfortably appointed.  The King or his agent wasn’t taking any chance with them turning on him…wise when dealing with them, they could each privately admit.  Rather than being slightest over the implied lack of trust they were somewhat soothed by it.AAt least this King – or whoever was managing him – wasn’t an utter fool.AWhat else he was or wasn’t they would have to discover for themselves.AStepping inside at the goblin’s behest the came to an immediate stop at the sight of Hit Wizard McGonagall leaning nonchalantly against the wall.  Severus being friendly-colleagues with McG’s mother Minerva was well aware of the power that laid in that bloodline.  Lucius on the other hand had dueled the man back when the Dark Lord was still active and had nearly not escaped with his life.A“You may go, Captain.”  A young voice ordered genially from under a concealing cloak.  His voice was cloaked as well, giving no real information about the figure other than he wasn’t fully an adult.  “I’m certain Lords Prince and Malfoy would not dare to harm Us while you are just outside the door.”A“Your Uncle will skin me alive.”  McG said with a sigh, no trace of heavy Scots accent anywhere in his voice.  It simply wasn’t proper for the Captain of the Guard for the Royal Household of Avalon to sound like an uneducated bumpkin.  His mother would have his hide.  “If your werewolf doesn’t bite me first.”A“You can do your duty as Captain of the Guard as a werewolf.”  The figure said musingly.  “Without your skin however…”AMcG rolled his eyes irreverently and gave a crisp bow, deeper to the seat figure and then to the Lords as their Houses dictated, and strode confidently from the room.AOnly by force of will did the two Lords refrain from commenting on their little byplay.  It read to them both as a farce put on for their benefit.  Staged in part to put them at ease with their easy banter and in part as an intimidation tactic.  Though there wasn’t much intimidation needed beyond having the infamous McG as the Captain of the Guard.AThe Hit Wizard no doubt held the rest to the same high standard of performance as himself, making for a truly deadly force.AUnder the cloak, hood still up and charms still in place to moderately disguise his voice, Hadrian stood and gave the Lords a small nod.A“Lords Prince and Malfoy.”  He waved to a pair of chairs across from them.  “Thank you for coming.”ASnape held in a snort.AIf Lucius received a similar summons as his own there was no doubt in his mind that nothing and no one would’ve been able to keep him away.A“Lord Prince.”  Hadrian folded his leather-gloved hands on the table before him.  “We have more business to discuss than Us and Lord Malfoy.  Would you be amenable to ceding your Right of Precedence to Lord Malfoy on this occasion?”ASeverus gave a smooth nod, not even twitching when a silencing bubble shot up all around him without the cloaked figure moving a finger or speaking a word.A“Lord Malfoy,” Hadrian smiled under his hood.  “I have to say I much admire your work in restoring your Family’s good Name after the…questionable choices of your Sire.”  The and yourself was implied though for politeness not stated.  “As such I have a question to put to you.”ALucius took the back-handed compliment with good grace, restraining his desire to sneer at the cocky whelp.  The wandless/wordless silencing bubble around his friend was an excellent motivator to be cautious with his dealings at this point.  Either the would-be King had more guards stationed under some form of invisibility device or spell or he was powerful enough to do the impressive bit of magic himself.AEither one was a great motivation for patience.A“Yes?”A“Do you like being a Death Eater?”  Hadrian asked bluntly, cocking his head to one side and ignoring the combination of rage and shock that crossed the man’s face before his icy mask went back up.  “I ask not out of some morbid sense of curiosity but because I genuinely want to know.  I’ve made a study of it and from what I could deduce, the only people who actually liked, enjoyed, or wanted to be Death Eaters were…well…bat-shit crazy fanatics.  And pardon the language, but that doesn’t seem to match what I’ve heard about the urbane and erudite Lord Malfoy.”APlus the only thing Malfoys were known for liking more than power was money and Voldemort tended to treat his followers’ money like his own – which he didn’t have any longer after losing his title to Hadrian by right-of-conquest.A“I was,”A“Don’t say under the Imperious.”  Hadrian snapped out, holding up a regal hand.  “I don’t believe that drivel.  At least not as far as Tom Riddle’s left-hand is concerned.  I wouldn’t put it past him to use the Imperious to create cannon-fodder but not his most trusted advisor.”A“You are well informed.”  For a child.  “You must have had the best of educations and tutors.”A“Of course I did.”  Hadrian shrugged, not fazed by the allusion to his age.  “That however, doesn’t answer my question.”A“Did I like being a Death Eater?”  Lucius arched a pale-blonde brow, eyes like glittering shard of silver ice.  “I believe you said it yourself.  I am neither insane nor a fanatic.”A“Superb.”  Hadrian held out a contract, Lucius taking the folio with on elegant hand.  “The file you have there is a binding contract.  Within it are a variety of Vows and Oaths required by all members of the Privy Council,” silver-grey eyes shot up before he flipped open the leather folder and scanning the document frantically.  “With a few extras for yourself.”A“You,” Lucius cleared his throat, feeling flat-footed and unprepared for this turn of events.  “You intend to make me Lord of the Privy Seal?”A“Conditional on my being able to remove the Dark Mark and use a Mark of my own to anchor the list of additional Vows I require before allowing you into my,” his lips twitched.  “Inner Circle.  The Kingdom of Avalon has not had a King for hundreds of years, the world has changed.  I find myself in need of a master of managing information, image, and the dreaded press.  There is no one in the Wizarding World better at it than you.  And with the taking of Oaths, there is no one I will be able to trust more to do this job than yourself, Lord Malfoy.”ALord of the Privy Seal.  Lucius sat back flummoxed.  No member of House Malfoy had ever risen to the ranks of either the Royal Household or the Privy Council.  Those were usually the domain of the Utmost and Most Ancient and Noble Houses.ARumor and innuendo, he mused.  There was much of it for a brief time a few years ago about traffic in the oldest Vaults of Gringotts.  Vaults that hadn’t been open for years suddenly becoming active again.  Perhaps, he thought with clarity as his Mark twanged in remembrance.  There was a reason why the Utmost Houses weren’t available to fill the Council anymore.AReasons connected to the young man in front of him.A“If you can remove the Dark Mark.”  Lucius conceded, taking up the Blood Quill in front of him and signing on the dotted line, taking a deep breath as he felt the Vows and Oaths snap into place.  Though not the ones that needed anchoring through another Mark.  “I’m your man for life.”A“Excellent.”  Hadrian hopped to his feet and rounded the table.  “I’ll need to see it.  I’ve never met a Death Eater in person before though my guardians all have.”AWell aware of Severus watching every move they made with his ever-calculating shark’s gaze – Lucius wouldn’t put it past the man to know who to read lips – he stood and shrugged off his elegant outer robe of silver-threaded silk and then doffed his underlying frockcoat of superfine linen.  Undoing the cufflink on his left arm that was embossed with the Malfoy peacock-feather, he rolled back the pure-white sleeve, the faded-ink-black of the Dark Mark showing to stark relief against his pale nobleman’s skin.  The younger man didn’t so much as flinch as he cradled the arm in one hand and leaned close to examine the Mark.A“Hmm,” he said lifting his head, revealing bright-green eyes hiding under that concealing hood.  “It can’t be so simple…” Hadrian trailed off musing to himself.ALucius flinched imperceptivity as the young man – a very young man judging by his hand once he pulled off a glove – placed a bare finger on the Mark and pressed both physically and with his magic which rose to suffocating levels.  The Lord Malfoy could even see Severus reacting inside his little bubble and the Potions Master was one of the most powerful wizards Lucius knew outside of him, their former Master, and that old goat Dumbledore.  He held in a pained wince as the Mark reacted to the foreign magic.A“Ah,” the still-hooded young man said.  “Of course.”AThe would-be King increased the power he used against the magic of the Mark before speaking a Word that had Lucius nearly fainting in shock.  Not because he understood what the young man said but because he couldn’t.  Avalon’s new King was a Parselmouth.A“Finite Incantatum.”AThere was a horrible shriek and then the Mark appeared to burst into flame on Lucius’s arm and around the King’s hand.  But the fire wasn’t hot nor did it burn.  The King’s magic protected them.AWhen the flames died down after a long moment, there was nothing left of the stain on the Malfoy Family Honor.  Not even ash.ABut the King didn’t let go of this arm, instead he shifted his grip and turned Lucius to face him head-on, his bared hand reaching up and with another display of his magic splitting the fine-Egyptian cotton right above Lucius’s heart.AOnce more touching the Lord of Malfoy skin-on-skin, the King spoke another Word this time in an Ancient variation of Gaelic or Welsh Lucius should recognize but couldn’t translate and another Mark appeared on his skin.ARather than the Crest of Emrys the King had used on his summons, the Mark was in the form of this King’s personal Crest appeared.  A Mark made up of Crossed Swords surrounded by thirteen stars, used to bind his Lord of the Privy Seal to his additional Oaths and Vows.  Very similar to the Emrys Crest but at the same time worlds apart.ALucius gritted his teeth as the other required Oaths and Vows snapped like shackles around his mind.  Any vague thought of twisting things to his advantage vanished as instinctual knowledge of how the Mark would punish him possessed his mind.  No.  Young he might be but the King was no fool.  The House of Malfoy was all at once neutralized against him and set into play for him.ACunning, Lucius smirked to himself.  His new King was most definitely of the Line of Slytherin.AAnd so far much saner than the last King of the Snakes.AHadrian repaired the damage to the shirt and bade the Lord Malfoy to retake his seat.  Quickly they went over the sample press releases that he’d drawn up with help from Mycroft and Russell, allowing Lord Malfoy to get a feel for the sort of press they were after.  Hadrian drew his attention to the list of important dates and events that were already planned and in motion that he would need to cover – especially the reforms and his assuming the Throne of Avalon as those had the potential for the worst sort of press that Britain was notorious for.ALucius raised his brow at the betrothal announcement.  There was a rumor floating around that the House of Nimue had been renewed but no confirmation of it.  And there in black and white was proof of an engagement between the Heir of Emrys and the Lord of Nimue.AImpressive political maneuvering before he’d even taken the Throne.  Lucius thought he might actually enjoy his new position.AAnother brow-raiser was a planned press release to Potion’s Quarterly discussing the youngest Potions Master in centuries joining the Royal Household as Potions Master and Researcher for the Royal House of Avalon.A“I assume Severus is unaware of his new position?”  Lucius asked drily.  “And I see several different betrothal and marriage announcements.  How many should I plan for in total and what sort of timeline?”A“Thirteen total,” Hadrian admitted with a slight grimace.  He still wasn’t happy with that.  “Though several are subject to contracts from before my birth.  And between now and my twentieth birthday.”AA nod from Lucius before he rose, gathering the papers and parchments together.  He had quite a bit to accomplish by August First which was only two days away.  Best not dawdle.A“Is there anything else your Grace requires before I take my leave?”  He gave a smooth bow and used the honorific though it wasn’t strictly necessary until the First.A“One question,” Hadrian glared down at what he’d taken to calling “That Infernal List!”  “Lady Narcissa Malfoy nee Black.  Would she be more in line with her sister Bellatrix or Andromeda.”ALucius was stunned by the question though he didn’t show it.A“Andromeda.”  He nonetheless answered quickly.  “She has never shared Bella’s…fervor…in matters of blood.  She has been an exemplary Lady Malfoy.”A“Fantastic.”  Hadrian checked off one line of his Chatelaine list and put a question mark beside another.  “You have my secretary’s information.  Owl him with a date and time next week which suits the Lady Malfoy for a meeting with Us and a few others.  I find myself in desperate need of Chatelaines for both my personal and Our Royal residences and properties.  You were the last I needed to speak with regarding Lady Narcissa’s suitability for one or more of those positions with the Royal Household.  Have a good day, Lord Malfoy.”AA nearly gaping Lucius backed from the room with a bow before straightening and clutching the file to his chest striding from the back.ANarcissa was never going to believe this…A...ASeverus waited with straining patience as the Heir of Emrys concluded his business with Lucius.AHe’d tried everything to rid himself with the Dark Mark.  Especially with the Dark Lord absent and his last act being slaughtering his childhood friend.  Severus loved the Dark Arts.  But he would renounce them in a second if it would bring Lily back to life.AAnd with a few minutes, a few words, and an impressive display of magical force, his best-friend was freed from the Mark forever.AIt made the spy wonder what exactly the cost had been.AAnd why Lucius had signed a contract in his own blood.ADeath Eaters were bound to serve Voldemort, that was true.  But not even that madman had used their own blood to bind them.  That was solely the province of alliances between Houses – something the Dark Lord had never been able to prove and use to his advantage despite all’s assumption over him being the Heir of Slytherin.  It had nearly driven the man mad long before his obsession with immortality did that he couldn’t call himself Lord Slytherin nor was he able to use the rites of nobility to bind his followers to him.AThe Dark Mark was the best he could do and everyone thought it was permanent.AThat was until today.AWhen the blonde had taken his leave and the bubble surrounding him collapsed, Severus immediately asked.A“How was that possible?”A“The former Heir of Slytherin used parseltongue to form the Dark Marks – as I had suspected from my research.”  The much-younger man removed his second glove and placed them gently on the table, refolding his ivory hands beside them.  “All you need is the ability to speak parseltongue and enough power to overload the Mark’s magic and done.”ASeverus churned that little nugget of information over in his head whilst still listening as the would-be monarch got to one of the points of Severus’s presence.A“I would prefer my future father-in-law did not have the brand of a madman man on his arm.”  Severus looked up sharply and slammed his hand down, catching the file that were slid across towards him before they crashed into his chest or the floor.A“Before you are two contracts.  One is a copy of the marriage contracts binding the Heir of the Royal House of Ravenclaw together with the Heir of House Prince.  It was formed as a surety of good-faith during a treaty.  It is binding with very little wiggle room.  Your Heir, Octavian I believe?  Is bound to marry Us.”  Hadrian’s voice went silky.  “I will not have a Death Eater for a father-in-law.  The second file contains a contract binding Severus Tobias Snape-Prince, Lord Prince, to serve the Royal Household as Potions Master and Researcher until released.  It contains an identical set of Vows and Oaths that all retainers of the Royal Household must take.  In addition are a series of Vows governing your former activities and ensuring your sole loyalty is to Avalon and Us.  You will sign.”  His very voice was a threat.  “You will serve.  And you will be loyal.  Or for a wedding present I will present your son and Heir with your head.”AIt wasn’t the best way to start a marriage but in this Hadrian the King took precedence over Hadrian the Person.  No Marked Death Eater was going to mar the Kingdom of Avalon.  Not even one who recanted and turned spy.A“You have me well-cornered.”  Severus conceded as he raised a brow at the extravagant Potions contract.  Nothing it contained was in any way objectionable.  Nor did it require the teaching of dunderheads.  Instead it gave him nearly carte blanche to research and experiment as long as he maintained the required stock of potions for the Royal Household and made himself available as needed to the Royal Healer and his Grace the King.  An enticing carrot just in-case he didn’t heed the obvious stick.AThough something told him this young man wouldn’t hesitate in doing exactly as he said.  Tavi would hate him for it but what was the distemper and disdain of a single consort when you were King and had a riotous country to keep in hand?AIn his position, Severus would do the same.A“There is one problem.”  His legendary gaze was piercing.  “I made an Unbreakable Vow to protect the child of a late friend.  That cannot be overwritten with this.”  Severus held up the contract with one lean hand.A“Who was the friend and child?”  Hadrian leaned forward, having some idea of Snape’s background courtesy of his uncles.  If it was a Death Eater and child that would be a problem indeed.  But if it wasn’t…there was only one ‘late friend’ who came to mind.A“Lily Evans and her son Harry Potter.”  There was a barely-audible sneer on Potter, amusing Hadrian.  The Potions Master would know like all Lords that the Potters were closely aligned with the Royal Houses and didn’t want to piss off the new King over a childhood rivalry.  But he couldn’t keep himself completely neutral either.A“That won’t be a problem at all.”  Hadrian would chuckle if he wasn’t desperately trying to stay in character.ASirius was going to have a coronary.ASeverus nodded hesitantly before picking up the same Blood Quill as Lucius and signing as required.  Better his dream job than a beheading.  Besides Albus had grown extremely tiresome lately.  Not having to return to the castle after break would be a relief.AAnything to get away from the Weasley Twin Terrors and constant offers of tea and lemon drops.AThese Weasleys were smart and quite the brewers.ABut insane.ASo very, very insane.AAfter he’d signed they repeated the earlier process with Lucius only quicker as Hadrian knew what to expect.  Once the Vows and Mark were in place, they sat once more.  Severus’s insatiable curiosity got that better of him and he asked:A“How can you be sure my vow of protection towards Harry Potter won’t be an issue?”  That would be impossible to accurately predict.AHadrian grinned and lowered his hood, secure in letting Lord Prince in on the secret now that he was wrapped up in Oaths.A“Morgana’s Tits!”  Severus gasped eyes wide.  “Potter!”  He was close to spluttering.A“Among many other things,” Hadrian smirked.  “Yes, I am.”ASeeing that the boy wasn’t going to answer any of the multitude of questions Severus had regarding his latest bombarda to Severus’s sense of equilibrium, he returned to the topic at hand.A“What are the precise details of the contract with my son and when shall my duties as Potions Master begin?”A“We have to be wed – not just bonded – by my fourteenth birthday.”  Hadrian replied promptly.  He’d memorized the details of the various contracts.  “With children once we’ve both finished our educations however long that might last.  It was a contract with Ravenclaw after all.”  He said jokingly.  “As for your new position the Royal Household and Our retainers will be removing to Skye Palace in Avalon or Snowdon Castle in Wales sometime within the next month.  You can expect an owl from the Royal Steward Tristan Bolyn with the details when We have settled on a locale.  All members of the Royal Household are required to reside in the Royal Residence unless taking leave for some reason.  Or when I attend Hogwarts.  You’ll be given a choice between remaining at the main residence or living in your own at that time.  Your children and family are of course welcome.  Some of the Privy Council will also be living at the Royal Residence for the first few years.”A“Very well.”  Severus nodded, it was acceptable.  “And regarding the contract…?”AHadrian sighed.A“I’m in the process of Courting my Bonded-Betrothed and first Consort, the Lord of House Nimue.  Until we’ve wed and I’ve taken the Throne and had my coronation I don’t really have the time to Court another.  I would like to get to know your Heir before I spend the rest of my life Bonded to him.  However what and when you tell him is entirely up to you.”A…",The Avalon Seven,108617

with anyone who planned a major life event such as a wedding or big anniversary party can tell you: it’s easy to obsess over the minutiae.AThat’s how wedding and party planners stay in business after all: dealing and obsessing over bullshit so you can just show up and have the time of your life.AAt least that’s how it’s supposed to work in theory.AIn Hadrian’s world it’s like living with a phalanx of party planners who were the morbidly-cunning offspring of a vicious dictator and a unicorn-on-crack/cocaine.ACompared to the insanity of his betrothal he’d thought his Claiming wouldn’t be an Event.AYes, it was one of the most important things he would ever do.AHe understood that.AIt’d been explained to him repeatedly at least once a month for the last seven years – more if he’d had a rebellious week and he was being tortured with lectures on birth-rights and duty.AAs he’d understood it his Claiming of his Lordships and Houses was just that: his.AAll it really required was him, an atheme, a ritual site, and several witnesses who weren’t relations or bound into his service.AThe latter being the reason he’d held off on contracting with the rest of the people he’d tipped for filling the ranks of his Privy Council and his needed (please Circe soon) Chatelaines.  It gave him a ready pool of witnesses to choose from who were theoretically impartial.  At the moment anyway.ASo when the adults all around him seemed to become infected with a singular form of rabies only without the frothing at the mouth – so far – he’d been justifiably confused.AWhat was there to plan?AHe followed the debate over who to include as the “impartial” witnesses, that at least made sense to him.  When they’d all agreed with Lady Amelia Bones, her younger brother Sandringham who held a duel Mastery in Magical Law and Estate Management & Finance, and Lord Garrick Ollivander, Hadrian had let out a breath.  They were done, debate over, he could go back to plotting how deal with the various head of government both magical and mundane who managed his territories.AApparently he’d stopped holding his breath a mite too soon.ANext the atheme came under discussion, mainly between Siger and Sirius arguing whether using the Holmes or Black Ritual Knife would be more appropriate.  He’d used the first to Confirm his Inheritance and the second during the Funeral Rites for his Grandpapa so he was familiar with them first.  He found himself saved through the intervention of an unlikely source.ALord Ragnarok had personally inspected the Emrys Vaults and taken out the ancient Ritual Knife used before the original founding of Avalon when the Emrys Family ruled over the majority of Wales and Ireland.AIt wasn’t even considered previously as he couldn’t enter any of the Vaults and remove anything until after his Claiming.AOk, they were done now right?AWitnesses chosen and secretly approached, atheme recovered, they were done.ANot yet.AThe biggest debate of all wound up being over where he would perform the Claiming.ASirius wanted Castle Black as one of the oldest residences Hadrian had inherited.  Since Lord Black had turned over control of the Wards to Sirius before he passed they were still able to access the ancient Black fortress.  All of the other inherited properties were closed to Hadrian until he Claimed his Lordships and was able to enter the Family Vaults to remove the ward stones and learn the locations of the unplottable residences.AApparently Hadrian came from a very, very paranoid bunch.  The wards on all Noble properties were set to turn unplottable if there wasn’t an active Lord.  It was an ancient protection to prevent guardians from accessing their Ward’s vaults and removing valuables from their properties.  The only money Hadrian has had access to were some very affluent trust vaults.AThough the goblins had found a loophole that let him inventory and audit all of his holdings, properties, and investments as well as his liquid assets.AWhich also allowed him to order the audit on the governmental finances that were involved in the territories controlled by the Kingdom of Avalon.  Altogether they started it on his fifth birthday and have continued to audit and monitor them for the last four years after the initial audit was complete.  There were going to be some very put-out government workers when they woke up on August 2nd and were charged with theft, embezzlement, and in some cases high treason.AHis Papa Siger wanted to use the ritual space at Ravenscroft Hill, Lord Holmes wanted to use Holmes Manor, while Lord Wallace wanted the ritual to take place at his estate.AIt quickly became a popularity contest between his godfather and his three guardians.AFinally the day before his birthday they were able to all agree on using the ancient Druid ritual space at Stonehenge.AIt only took two months and several uncomfortable family dinners for that arrangements to be finalized.A…AAfter Lord Prince left Hadrian alone in the meeting room at Gringotts Hadrian pulled off his concealing cloak, revealing mundane work-out clothes.  Reaching into his pocket he took out a shrunken bag and enlarged it while McG looked on with raised brows.  Slinging the duffle bag over his shoulder he wrapped the cloak into a bundle and stuffed it into a side pocket.AStriding from the room, Hadrian made for the Alley and the closest port-key point, his Captain of the Guard dogging his heals.A“And what might you be up to?”  McG finally asked as his charge lifted a simple pendant with the Holmes crest on a braided leather cord from under this soft cotton t-shirt.  That most definitely wasn’t the port-key McG had been briefed on that led directly to Hadrian’s quarters in Ravenscroft.A“Unwinding.”  He said succinctly.  “I haven’t been to a Krav Maga spar in weeks and John’s been so busy clearing his calendar at work he hasn’t been to Sunday dinner in a month even if Sherlock made it.  My schedule is about to be so tight I won’t be able to visit London until after the Ball in September.  I’m going.  The only question is whether you’re going with me.  If so you better grab on, I set the port-key on a timer when I took it out of my shirt and you have five seconds left.”ACursing bodies that insisted on being impossible to guard, McG slapped his hand down on the medallion.AAt the end of the day there’s one rule above all else when you’re being an active bodyguard: never lose the body.AYou can always yell and scream later.AA fishhook grabbed him behind the navel and sucked him through the ether, dropping them both in the empty second bedroom at 221B Baker Street, London.AThe massive Scotsman who stood well over six feet tall, glared with his dark brown eyes at the completely unrepentant face of the future King of Avalon.A“Yer gonna be a problem, aren’t ya laddie?”  His burr was in full-force as he struggled with how he was going to explain this to Lord Holmes.  The first day on the job and his charge was already giving him fits.A“Not a problem.”  Hadrian said with a shrug.  “We didn’t know how long the meeting would take so we cleared the afternoon.  I have another three hours and,” he cast a Tempus.  “Seventeen minutes before I’m due back at Ravenscroft for my purification ritual before the Claiming.  I’m going to spend that last three hours and now sixteen minutes as I please before I give my entire life over to being the King of Avalon.  So I’m going to go spend the next two hours with the people who saved my life when I was a mess of bruises, blood and broken bones.  Then I’m going to spar until I’m not forcefully restraining myself from exploding on the next person who tries to tell me how I’m not old enough to decide where my Claiming will be but still supposed to run a Kingdom starting at dawn.”AWithout another word after that mini-rant Hadrian stalked off to find his brother and John.A...ADr. John Watson looked up as the alarm ward Sirius had posted on their apartment dinged.  Sherlock had arranged it so that certain people could pop in and out of the spare room and that was where the alert came from.  If he had the meaning of the tone right it was one authorized person and one unauthorized person.AHe tucked the pistol he kept in his desk drawer into the back of his jeans and propped one hip against the arm of his side-chair, making sure he kept a clear view of the archway leading into the hall.AIt was probably Sirius or Remus bringing the new bodyguard by but with who they were connected to and Sherlock’s life mission of being an eternal annoyance to the criminal element of the United Kingdoms, it was better to be safe than sorry.ASherlock had heard the alarm but immediately deleted the information from his brain, being busily working on an experiment of some kind in their kitchen/lab.ATurned out John was both right and wrong.A“Harry.”  John smiled, walking over and giving the lean boy a hug then holding him out at arm’s length for an inspection.AHe hadn’t seen his former patient/little brother in weeks and at his age that could make a massive difference.AThe once-tiny waif had grown into quite the young man.  Tall for his age but still not in the tallest percentile and with a sense of power from his years of martial arts, fencing, and horseback riding.  All long, lean muscle at the moment he was destined to bulk out at least some with puberty.  His raven hair was pulled back in the tight braid he preferred for physical activity.ASherlock closed in on the two from behind, saber in hand, at the sight of the boy’s rather large shadow.  Much too large to be Remus though the Alpha werewolf wasn’t small by any means.  Proof positive that even when lost in his own mind his lover was aware of possible threats to his loved ones.A“Down, brother.”  Hadrian said without even looking, knowing what was going on because of the look in John’s eyes.  “He’s my new Captain of the Guard and I prefer him sans sword-wound and you awake instead of Stunned.”A“Blast.”  Sherlock pouted.  “I wanted to test his reaction time.  Sirius’s is quite astounding.  I’ve deduced that if McG was considered one of the finest Hit Wizards and Sirius one of the most dangerous Aurors that McG’s reflexes must be on par or better than Sirius’s.”A“No, Sherlock.”  Hadrian turned laughing green-eyes on his brother.  “Another day, perhaps.”A…AWatching the young monarch laugh and joke with his honorary brothers, McG finally “got it.”APerhaps it was because the three separate occasions he’s been around the young man he was always surrounded by his guardians or they were important affairs that he’d never seen this person before.  Kingsley had told him of the scene between the two betrothed before the ceremony and he hadn’t believed it.  The boy was too formal he thought.  Too much a King though he’d yet to Claim his Throne to unwind and play Snap and joke with his intended.AHe even had serious reservations about his former charge’s happiness, bound for life to a “proper pureblooded” spouse.AThe meeting he’d eavesdropped on between the Lords and Hadrian earlier and his interview for his current position had done nothing to alleviate that fear he’d had for young William and his future happiness.AHe knew that many royals – magical and mundane – were often concerned more with duty and the stability and future of their countries than happiness.AIt was almost as if happiness was to province of those not born to rule.AThen he had his new charge and King pull out a mystery port-key, rant at him twice, and scrap the rest of his schedule for the day so he could spend some of his last hours as a normal person being well, normal.AHadrian Augustus Emrys-Pendragon rolled on the floor, being double-teamed in a wrestling-match/tickle-war, and laughing and giggling for all he was worth.APerhaps there was hope for the boys after all…A…A“How goes the game?”  Sherlock asked his little brother lowly while John was busy showing McG pictures from when they’d first found Harry.ASherlock was the one who pointed out to Hadrian last year when they were discussing Britain’s First Wizarding War and the fall of Voldemort that despite common belief it was unlikely that the “Dark Lord” was truly dead.AHe found the evidence entirely inconclusive.AThen casually mentioned at as far as he could deduce, the “Dark Lord” Voldemort and the “Light Lord” Dumbledore tended to treat their people more like pawns than people.AAnd the monster game was born in an empty ballroom.AHadrian made an inconclusive sound deep in his throat as he studied the case file in front of him.  Sherlock had put it in his hands as soon as he was done fooling around, wanting an actual mage’s perspective.  Sherlock had no active magic of his own, his magical core rerouted to power his impossible brain.  When it came to magic there was plenty that didn’t even follow the so-called ”laws” of magic let alone physics.AHis little brother had gotten excellent at spotting when a deduction was being thrown off because of magic flexing Her Will.A“The pieces have mostly been identified and chosen.”  Hadrian said after a long moment.  “But until the Black King makes his play we’re waiting to truly begin.  Until then it’s more trading volleys between two sides of a four-player game.”A“Hmm.”  Sherlock hummed.  “So you’re in a holding pattern.”A“And you’ve got a case of accidental magic.”  Hadrian looked back down at the crime-scene photos of a sinkhole that had appeared in a park overnight causing thousands in property damage.  “A big one.”A“Walk me through your deductions.”A“The neighborhood is mostly industrial so it could’ve been a chemical accident but there was zero trace evidence.  It’s an area that is also frequented by a generally benign homeless community.  This,” he tapped a finger on the digital map and drew a line.  “Is the distance from the sinkhole to the nearest magical home, business, or public area.”  It was several miles.  “The main thing however, and the reason I deduce the case came through your website instead of the police, is that the sinkhole has a perfect circumference.”AHadrian grinned, beaming up at his brother.  “While the laws of magic would say it’s possible to do that with a spell, the sheer size, makes it highly improbable.  One spell couldn’t do it unless massively overpowered and several wouldn’t make the perfect circle.”A“How massively overpowered?”  Sherlock demanded he prove his deduction.A“Myself, Voldemort, Dumbledore.”  Hadrian grinned wider.  “In that order could do this with a single spell and not still be there suffering from our core being critically drained when people came to investigate.  Perhaps one or two others but not likely.”A“Why accidental magic?”A“Homeless population.”  His brother responded at once.  “Most homeless populations contain a certain percentage of children.  One of the leading reasons for childhood homelessness other than the entire family being on the streets is fundamental differences with their family or caregivers.  Accidental magic can begin manifesting at any age up to eleven and in rare cases as early as birth and up to the end of puberty.  Extreme emotion fueling accidental magic is capable of creating a sinkhole with this circumference without draining the caster since it tends to draw equally from the caster and the ambient magic in the area.”ASherlock grabbed another folder and handed it wordlessly to the future King of Avalon.A“Sally-Anne Perks, age seven, ran away from home last month after a fight that resulted in massive blunt-force trauma to her father and a shiner on her.  Police and doctors were baffled over how the father sustained his injury.  Picked up last week by police a half-mile from the sinkhole the morning after it appeared.  She’s in a group-home at the moment and has been approached several times since age six by the Ministry to attend a Wizarding School.  Her father has refused to allow it and she goes untrained.  As of yesterday she was informed that she will be attending compulsory classes at the wizarding primary school in London and has been moved to Cole’s Orphanage, her father’s custody revoked.”AHadrian snarled under his breath.  He hated that magical orphans were slapped into the mundane system when the magical world had the resources to care for them.  It led to incidents like the one Sherlock brought to his attention.AAnd likely riling him up was what his brother was after.AThey were both aware that his guardians were going to push from him to start implementing certain revisions to the current laws over others.  Sherlock wanted Harry to be angry over Sally-Anne because he refused to be angry on his own behalf.  Neither one of them wanted there to be anymore Harry Potters or Sally-Anne Perks being left out in the cold by the wizarding world.AHarry had someone to rescue him and became Hadrian.AWho did Sally-Anne Perks have?AA question Sherlock wanted at the very front of his royal brother’s mind going into the meetings with the governments he was about to control.A…A11:58 at night on July 31st saw an eclectic group standing in the gaps created by the missing stones at Stonehenge.AEveryone had come: Hadrian’s guardians, their spouses (save Lady Wallace), their children, the newly-contracted guard, Hadrian’s new retainers, those that he’d marked for the Privy Council, even John and Sherlock.ANo pressure or anything.AJust a large mashed up group making up some of the most powerful men and women in magical Britain, waiting for the clock to tick down one more minute and the show to begin.AAndddd….AHe was naked.A“Skyclad” was the appropriate term but for an eleven year old boy no matter how smart, mature, or comfortable in his skin, it was still awkward standing in the middle of one of the oldest magical sites in the old with nothing but an ancient dagger and his own skin for company while people who’ve known you anywhere from years to hours stand around waiting for you to do something.AThe site had been prepped, Hadrian himself had spent the last two hours painstakingly painting the proper runes for the ritual: Fehu for possessions won or earned, Uruz untamed potential and sudden change, Raidho seeing a larger perspective, Kenaz for harnessed power, Gebo for the gifts received, Nauthiz for recognition of one’s fate, Jera for the results of earlier efforts (in this case the Confirmation ceremony) realized, Algiz to ward off evil, Sowilo (a rune that mirrored the barely-visible scar on his forehead) for success, goals achieved, and honor, Tiwaz: honor, justice, leadership and authority, Mannaz for The Self, and then Othala for inheritance and ancestral property, finishing with Isa in the center to reinforce the others around it.AThirteen in total each with one of his House Crests below it.AThankfully Hadrian had been schooled in the Elder Futhark and art for years so it wasn’t too difficult but it was time consuming.  Especially with how detailed some of the Crests were.  Though he was able to do it clothed so there was that at least.AIt wasn’t until the last seven minutes before the “seventh month died” that he had to strip down and wait, breathing deeply and falling into a meditative trance, knowing and trusting that his power would alert him when the time for him to act appeared.A(Author’s Note: I didn’t write most of this.  From The Pagan Library)ASpeaking in Ancient Welsh, he began:A“Black spirits and white, Red spirits and grey, Harken to the rune I say. Four points of the Circle, weave the spell, East, South, West, North, your tale tell. East is for break of day, South is white for the noontide hour, In the West is twilight grey, And North is black, for the place of power.""ADrawing the blade of the ancient dagger he dragged it with slow precision down the palm of his dominant hand, what would be his wand-hand if he had need of one changing to Gaelic as he spoke.A“As above, so below As the universe, so the soul. As without, so within. Blessed and gracious one, Lady of Magic, On this day do I consecrate to you: My body,”AHadrian drew Uruz once more, this time in his own blood, on his left and right biceps to represent physical strength and masculine potency.  His strong arm to be Lady Magic’s strong arm.A“My mind.”AMannaz was repeated in the center of his forehead only for intelligence and forethought rather than The Self, again in the dripping blood from his bleeding hand.A“And my soul.”ATo represent the connection and bond he swore to Magic Herself, Hadrian drew Algiz over his heart before moving on to the next and final step finishing the chant in Latin:A“Dark is the night as I reach this turning point Here is a time of death, yet a time of rebirth. Endings and beginnings Ebbings and flowings A journey done and a journey yet to start. As the wheel turns, I see birth, death and rebirth and I know that every end is a beginning.AOn this night, that marks my birth, take my blood as sacrifice as I Claim that which those before me were born to, died for, and bled to see your Will done.AAs Magic wills it, so mote it be!”AHadrian took charge of the power that had been steadily building with each word and drop of blood, channeling it first through himself and then into the ancient dagger, the unadorned iron hilt heating unbearably as it nearly overloaded before he sent it out in a burst of Pure Magic at the rune Isa on the center Stone that he’d drawn earlier.  The magic burst hit the charging rune and spread, channeled through Hadrian and the blood-runes and into the painted runes and the Crests below him.AAt this point, if they were able to see it through the blinding wave of light and magic, the witnesses would have noticed Hadrian’s body being forced to grow as it attempted to channel the massive surge of magic as the last of the blocks in his Inheritance fell.AWithout him having to charge the runes on the Stones, there was no way he would’ve been able to channel so much pure energy and survive.  Not even Magic herself could have saved him by doing as she was now: gifting him with a magic-induced growth spurt to accommodate and leech off the excess his natural channels couldn’t handle.  The carefully-chosen blood runes helped immensely creating a pathway She could use to save her champion’s life.ASo as the Runes dictated so it was:AFor Uruz he gained physical strength and speed matched with untamed potential, great energy and health.  With Mannaz his intelligence, forethought, creativity, skills, natural abilities all gained a boost though not as dramatically as that he gained physically.  Thank Merlin he chose Uruz and not Thurisaz or he could’ve wound up with a completely uncontrollable temper and the size of a giant.  And with Algiz his natural inclination to defend others was bolstered along with his connection to Magic.AOne of the last thoughts he had before the Runes all around him finished charging and the magic slammed back into him with the concussive force of a tank blast was that nobody warned him about getting struck by lightning during a Claiming.A…AUtter panic set in as the light suddenly vanished, taking Hadrian along with it.AThere was a sense of a silent pandemonium slowly taking over their minds one by one as they processed what just happened.AThankfully there was at least one person there who was able to not completely lose his mind when Magic decided to do throw a spanner in the works.ALeave it to the sole strictly-mundane person to keep their head in the middle of what could turn into a magical crises.A“Is the Circle still active?”AJohn’s calm Doctor voice cut through the mental chatter that was nearly deafening.A“I’m not sensitive enough to tell.”  Sherlock answered his lover immediately, despite his currently residing in his mind palace as he went over every millisecond of the ritual.A“It’s not.”  The silky voice of Severus Snape called out as he moved with his enviable grace inside the Stones and then touched where the Crest of House Emrys used to be painted under the Rune Isa to charge the Claiming.  “And the site has been rendered inert.  No residual magic remains.”A“No offense.”  John nodded towards the black-clad man.  “But I don’t really know you.  Can anyone confirm?”A“If Lord Prince says the site is inert.”  Lady Bones stepped forward, hands down at her sides.  “Anyone I know would take him at his word.  There are few with his abilities and none here.”A“Very well,” Sherlock gave an abstract nod.  “Does anyone know what the bloody-fuck just happened?  Because I keep going over what I know of Ritual Lore and am coming up blank.”A“A Claiming.”  Lord Garrick Ollivander said in his whispery voice as he shifted to study each of the Stones in turn then looked at the spot where the boy disappeared from with his strange opalescent eyes.  “A Claiming unlike that which has been seen in centuries.  One for the Ages.  And we were all here to Stand Witness.”A“That’s all well and good.”  John nodded patiently.  “However that doesn’t help the problem at hand…”A“Does it not?”  Ollivander mused quietly.  “What would that be then?”A“Harry is missing.”  Sirius growled out, his eyes taking on a gleaming cast as his Grim form rose in his mind.A“Ah….”  The old wandsmith nodded.  “I see.  You all fear for the lad, and rightly so were the Claiming unsuccessful or Lady Magic displeased with his preparations.  However one thing has long been understood by those of us who have always Served the Houses Magic Blessed.  A true Heir of the Blessed Houses once Claimed for them and by them will be taken to the Ward Stones to fulfill His Duty to Protect Her People.”A“Meaning…?”  John shook his head, sometimes being the lone mundane in a pack of magicals was like spending too much time spinning on a spinny-chair.  It did nothing but leave you light-headed and not knowing up from down.A“Skye Palace.”  Remus breathed, eyes closing in relief.  “He’s been worrying for weeks over how to locate Skye Palace.  It’s not anywhere, not in any of the texts or documents or tomes he’s been given access to for tonight.  The Ward Stones must be there.  It would be the only place secure enough for the Royal Houses to keep them safe.”A“To recap.”  John checked that he had the facts straight.  “Harry, who just channeled such massive levels of magic I’d be surprise if they didn’t feel it in Australia, and was swaying on his feet from the attempt, was just magically whisked away, alone, to the mythical and legendary Capitol of Avalon.  Which no one here or anywhere knows where it is or how to access it.”A“Right…” Sirius closed his eyes and groaned.A“And this is a good thing…?”  John’s tone had turned mocking.  “How exactly?”A…AHe awoke in a strange domed room surrounded by crystals.ABlinking as he sat up, Hadrian lifted one hand to his aching head, his blood pounding away at his skull from the sudden influx of power.  He stared stupidly at his bare feet.  They didn’t look right.  They looked…bigger.ALowering his hand, he flexed it a few times stretching the perfectly healed scar in a silvery-cream that pulsed with a tinge of residual magic.  Raising his other hand as he was finally confident his core would support him, he turned them over quickly back and forth several times staring at his hand in relation to the bonding Cuff that never left his wrist.  It was smaller.ANo, that wasn’t right.AHis hands were bigger.A“What the bloody fuck is going on?”  He breathed, staring around in confusion at the thirteen pillars with their dimly-lit crystals.  Feeling behind him he reached back and hit a rough stone directly at his back.ACarefully pulling his feet under him he frowned a moment before waving his hand and fashioning a pair of light linen pants covering his nakedness.  For a strange cavern located who-knows-where it was surprisingly temperate.  Once he was sure he wouldn’t just topple back over like a felled tree – this time possibly seriously damaging himself without help in sight, Hadrian turned in a slow circle studying the room in its entirety.AWhat finally made it “click” for him was the one thing he hadn’t been able to see before: the rock behind him.AOr more accurately, the big-ass rough-cut diamond with a sword sticking out of it.A“Avalon.”  His eyes shot wide open.  “The Ward Chamber of Avalon.”AAt least he finally discovered how he was going to find Skye Palace, he thought fitfully.AThe pieces of a puzzle he wasn’t even aware he was trying to solve slid into place.AHe was in Avalon.AThe Sword was Ancuru, High-Elvish for Bright or Brilliant Magic and was forged for the first King of Avalon after the alliance of Emrys and Pendragon.  From its legend that of Excalibur was formed, taking with it the phrase chiseled into the very stone in which it rested: “For If He Be Worthy, Let Him Draw Me From My Rest.”  It was both warning and instruction.ANo King of Avalon had ever taken the Throne without drawing Ancuru from the diamond it rested in.ATaking a steadying breath, Hadrian stepped forward grasping the hilt with both hands, ignoring the pain caused by the sharpened edges of the grip which sliced new wounds into his hand sending blood dripping onto the diamond below.  As the Stone tasted his offering, it began to glow.  At first it was as dim as the Ward Stones resting on their pillars that surrounded it then steadily stronger and stronger as the magic in his very blood powered the central Ward Stone of Avalon.ATugging up sharply, Ancuru came loose in his hand with no more effort than he would use to draw any other sword from a sheath.AKnowing his job wasn’t quite finished, Hadrian walked to the first stone directly North of Ancuru’s Stone and let several drops of his blood fall onto the top.  It was an emerald – the Ward for Wales and Ireland.  Traveling clockwise which was also East-to-West, he moved from Stone to Stone powering each of the Wards for the Seven Kingdoms as well as another two for their allied nations.  The remaining four powered Avalon’s wards and those of their territories that were added after the Kingdoms were allied.ANo doubt Unspeakables all over the world had just gotten the shock of their collective lives.AThe Wards of Avalon were unlike any others.AFeeling woozy and light-headed, Hadrian followed his instincts, exiting the Ward Chamber deep within the center of Skye Palace and moved steadily until he was able to see the outside world, Ancuru still clasped in his bloodied hand, though it no longer cut him, the sharp edges folding back into the grip once their purpose was complete.AHadrian blinked as he moved out onto the first balcony he found then fell to his knees with a gasp.A“Well.”  He mused with a rasping voice to himself.  “I know why they called it Skye Palace now.”AAs it took up an entire flipping floating island in the fecking sky!AAnd it wasn’t the only one.AHadrian canted his head left and right, resolutely staying safely on the ground, er, floor for the moment.AAll around him were floating islands, all filled with buildings and infrastructure and even some that seemed to be made up of nothing but fields or rolling hills.AAll were silent, lying dormant and empty until another King took the Throne of Avalon.AIt was the biggest secret no one had ever discovered.AThe reason why no one could find Avalon was because it wasn’t possible for it to be found.  Reaching out with his magical senses, he found the “floor” of the magic.  The magic field that supported the dozens of islands and kept them afloat ended about a mile over his head and a quarter mile beneath him.  Avalon was completely surrounded by a magical suspension field that mundanes could neither sense nor see and must interfere with their technology without frying it completely.AAnd that same field worked as a gigantic unplottable Warding structure.AHidden entirely in plain sight: the legendary Kingdom of Avalon.AHadrian let out a chuckle as he saw the island pass by over mundane London.ARising to his feet he leaned on the railing, propping Ancuru next to him.A“Well, shit.”  He sighed.  “I found it.  Now what the hells do I do now?”A“Mipsy can bes helpings, Master.”  A piping voice came from behind him.ALooking over his shoulder he spied a mass of House Elves hiding in the shadows of the Palace, peeking around corners and statues and suits of armor to get a look at him.AHouse Elves.AThe best friends of stranded wizards everywhere, he decided with a small grin.A“This should be fun.”A…AMipsy, who turned out to be the sacrificial lamb the House Elves sent to greet the possibly-deranged new Master and not the Head Elf, popped him into a lushly appointed receiving-room.  It wasn’t the Throne room or even one of the “best” receiving rooms for royal guests to Avalon but it was warm, the fire was lit, there was a steaming pot of coffee on the low table, and the larger-than-the-rest armchair was like sinking into a cloud.  Since the Elves were delirious with joy over having a new King in the Palace – made even happier when they discovered he had the beginnings of a Household – they’d begun popping in randomly to see him as word spread from the Palace to the surrounding city.AAccording to the oldest elf Hadrian had ever heard of let alone seen – he was honestly afraid Lop would just fall over dead at any moment – when the Palace and the Wards running it closed after the death of the last King, the House Elves all stayed no matter what Family they were bound to in order to maintain the city.  It was a relief considering that even with the best of stasis charms, fields still needed to be rotated and tended, roofs needed repair, and preservation charms updated.  He’d even had a bet going with Sherlock over whether he’d find a ruin or not.AUnsurprisingly Sherlock had won with his assertion that dead or not, no King would let their legacy fall to ruin if there was a way to prevent it.AAnd one thing they’d all learned with magic – especially Hadrian’s – was if there was a will there was a way.AFor the ancient Avalonian Kings apparently that way was House Elves.AAvalon turned out to be completely self-sustaining according to Lop.  Since the House Elves had been trained in all areas of making a house or farm run depending on the Family they worked for they were able to teach each other what was needed.  The House Elves of Avalon had set up a communal society in the absence of a Master, one that worked shockingly well for them with the magic of Avalon itself sustaining them.AHowever, Lop was loathe to point out, the longer Avalon went without a King the less magic was available to sustain the Elves.AThere hadn’t been an elfling born for over two centuries.AFor that alone the Elves would adore him – and his surplus of magic – even if they weren’t bound to his service.AOne thing he learned that was surprising was that the Avalon Elves could pop down to the surface of the planet – but that land-elves couldn’t pop up to Avalon.AAnother of his ancestors’ protections.ANor were they capable of making potions and their stores were long depleted so no blood replenisher or other magical remedy for his light-headedness and disorientation with his enlarged body was in the offing until the elves he sent down for his family and Household returned.AHe sent Mipsy after his Lord of the Privy Seal.AIt was time for an announcement.A…A“I don’t know which to yell at you first over.”AAndromeda’s tone was not pleased as his long-time Healer strode into the room, skirt billowing like a sail in full-wind.AAt least she was concerned.A“That you’re ruining what is probably a priceless antique by sprawling there covered in blood and things or that you have a massive sword just idly resting on your lap.”AOr not.  Not concerned worked too.  As long as she had some potions on her.  Hadrian had work to do and little time to do it.A“Why yes, Andy.”  He mocked, cracking an eye open to glare at her balefully.  “I’m perfectly fine.  No, I wasn’t sucked into a magical vortex and dumped onto a cold stone floor after bleeding myself.  And no, I didn’t then have to cut myself open again to pull a ruddy sword from a bloody stone and then use the blood from that to power the wards.  I’m just peachy.  Do carry on with scolding me because I haven’t managed to find a tub and some soap yet.”AHis Healer merely tsked, arching a brow.  “Well as you were propped in a chair one would assume you were at least in an acceptable condition.”  Flicking her wand she cast a quick diagnostic the handed him a trio of phials from the ever-present pack at her hip.  “Nothing a few potions and some rest won’t cure, as I had assumed.  They’re stronger than you’re usual,” she warned.  “Your new Potions Master,” now he knew he heard tone.  “Was quite efficient with getting me supplied previous to the ritual.”AHadrian shrugged and knocked back the phials.  He recognized a muscle-ease, mild pain-reliever, a headache potion, and the fruit of the gods at the moment: a blood replenisher.A“Pepper up?”A“I said rest, Hadrian.”  Andromeda propped her fists on her hips.  “Rest.”A“Rest, Hadrian.”  The young man mimicked.  “Never mind that you have to meet with your Lord of the Privy Seal, Hadrian.  Just rest Hadrian.  Or the half a dozen other things that need to be done before dawn.  Rest.”A“Tone.”A“King.”  Hadrian arched a brow and lifted the sword, jabbing it point-up towards the ceiling in a lackadaisical motion.  “Got the pretty and everything.”AGrowling low in her throat, she reached into the bag and all but flung the phial at him, Hadrian nipping it out of the air with the reflexes of a trained fighter.A“I’m worried about the magical growth spurt, Harry.”  Andromeda told him seriously.  “That had the potential to put a serious strain on your magical core and your internal organs.  They’re just not meant to go through what happened tonight.  You need rest and observation to head off any potential problems.  I’ll give you two hours and then I want you passed out in wherever your new bedroom in this place is.”  Andromeda looked around the room.  “I’ve only seen the foyer and the path here, your elf Whimsy was quite insistent.”AAs if Andromeda wouldn’t have marched right to his side, elf or no.A“A couple hours is all I need.”  Hadrian soothed her gently.  “I just have to head off the worst of the coming storm before I do anything else.  People need sworn into my service, arrests need made, and several press statements need to go out.  Everything else can wait for the morrow.”  He looked out at the darkening sky – a tell-tale sign that the night was fading fast.  “Or the afternoon.”AThe arrests were one of the main issues.  Lady Amelia had to be sworn in so she can sign the orders along with himself and Sirius as High Constable.  He wanted his hands on a few people before they can disappear into their hidey-holes once the turnover of power is announced.AHigh Treason wasn’t something Hadrian could afford to dick-around with.  Not at the onset of his rule.  His coronation wasn’t for two years, but that was just so he had time to get used to the position and his people had time to plan it.AThe moment Ancuru left the Stone, Hadrian Augustus Emrys-Pendragon was King.ANow he had to act like one.AKnocking back the Pepper-Up he rose to his new height – an astonishing five-six – six inches taller than he’d been that morning, and gave Andy a buss on the cheek and a rakish grin, propping Ancuru on his shoulder before sauntering from the room.A“Surely you’re not going to run around with that thing all the time!”  She shouted at his back.A“I don’t know.”  He called back cheerfully.  “It does make a statement…”A…AThe meeting with Lucius was quick-and-dirty.AThanks to the draft releases Hadrian had given him, the master of Image knew exactly what sort of tone the new King was looking for and had already prepared something for each of the key publications that would provide it.  A quick picture taken of Ancuru laid out on a rich rosewood table with only a view of Hadrian’s hand – signet of Avalon in place on his left middle finger and his Cuff in full view – provided a visual confirmation of the story without revealing the face behind the revived Kingdom.ALord Ragnarok had removed the signet Rings for Hadrian’s Houses.  The new King was beyond pleased when his Lord High Steward thrust the box at him and gruffly told him to “put them on, they’re yours now.”  The Royal Houses merged together when he slid them on his left middle finger, leaving only the Crest of Avalon showing though he could change it to show any of them at will.  The same happened with the non-Royal houses on his right-middle-finger only showing his personal Crest that Marked his Lord of the Privy Seal and his Potions Master instead of that of Avalon.ANeedless to say, it was the Crest of Avalon Lucius wanted highlighted in the picture, along with the easily-recognizable Sword.AThe only other blade in magical history that neared Ancuru’s fame was that of Godric Gryffindor though it had belonged to his Royal House long before it came into the hand of the most-famed of the Lions.APhoto and minute corrections to the press releases in hand – and with a spring in his step as he’d won an argument over what to do with the Witch Weekly spread – Lucius was able to port-key back to his home courtesy of his new pendant that doubled as the sign of his Office.  Made of rose gold to signify his status as a Lord of an Aged and Noble House, the Crest of Avalon was engraved on the face of the peach-sized medallion in mithril.  It was one of a set that was given to each of the Privy Council as they were sworn into their positions though one remained empty for now.  Each had the Crest of Avalon engraved in mithril with the face and chain of the medallion worked in the metal of their status.AAll but Goblin Ragnok who had no use for such a thing, preferring instead a simple leather band with the two-way port-key anchored to a plain onyx cabochon.AHadrian gave great thanks to Lady Magic that the two-way port-keys were already fashioned, simply needing to be keyed to the holder with a drop of their blood.  The blood also acted as a test of their status, the plain-silver chains and medallions each morphing into the metal associated with their House.  And for once that night, he wasn’t the one who had to bleed.AHis newly-appointed Lord High Constable (Sirius) and Lord High Justice (Lady Bones) made quick work of signing the arrest warrants that Hadrian then sealed with the Crest of Avalon before handing the handful of parchments to McG to have the Guard around them up and make them guests of the Realm in the bowels of Snowdon Castle.AAvalon had once used Azkaban Prison as both prison and jail until it was turned over to the Ministry.AAfter hearing Sirius’s nightmares as a young child – a problem even now years later and with Mind Healing – Hadrian would rather tear the place down stone-by-stone than suffer anyone to play victim and lunch to Dementors.AFinished with his “short” list, he stumbled his way through the halls towards where he just knew his quarters were.  Score one for inherited memory.  He thought sleepily to himself.  McG trailed along behind him, not entirely trusting that his young King would make it there upright.AThe Scot wasn’t far off.ANo sooner had he pushed through the door than he was face-down on the fluffy comforter of his bed, using what he had left in his reserves to pop over.AMcG hadn’t even closed the door before he could hear snores coming from the weary form on the bed.",The Avalon Seven,108617

Extra!AAWills made his way on Silenced feet through the elegant marble-and-gemstone halls of Skye Palace.AElegant was the only way to describe it, even his parents – who had swung between fighting with each other and over him being magically bonded to a male for the rest of his life – had found nothing critical to say about the capitol of Avalon when the House Elves had arrived for them early that morning.  The whole family was here, staying in apartments that were more lavishly appointed than their own at Windsor Castle or Buckingham Palace.  Originally it was just supposed to be himself, Kings, Harry, and his parents but one of the elves had given Kings a letter and the next thing Wills knew his Grandparents were bustling into the room.AAny pique from the Queen was averted as soon as she saw her rooms.AHadrian had given them an entire wing of his palace for their stay.  Though Wills’s room was by far the nicest – something his father had grumbled over being a slight against him and his Queen but was silenced with the reminder that of them all only Wills had real status in Avalon.  The rest of them were treated with the same courtesy was Wills because they were his family, nothing more.AHis assigned personal-elf Mipsy, another special privilege of being Lord Nimue and Rian’s betrothed, had told him that otherwise when the Queen came for business she would’ve been in a public guest wing with the “other muggleses”.  Her Royal accommodations were only Royal because she was his grandmother.  It was a boggling twist to his world.  Everything had always been the other way around.  Special treatment provided because of who his grandmother and father were, not who Wills was.AHe had to admit it felt nice.  Being highly valued for himself instead of his family.  Part of it was due to his House but that could’ve been anyone besides him.  Magic chose him as the Lord of Nimue.  And that just felt good, that Magic felt him worthy of leading a House as him and not “Prince William of Wales.”AMipsy was also the reason he was now creeping through the halls.  Kings had “warned” him that the Wards were so strong that there was no possible way for the Ministry of Magic to pick up his magic use here.  After trying futilely to get some more sleep, he’d called for the lively little elf and asked her what Rian was up to.ADiscovering that he was sleeping in the King’s Tower – a massive spear-like structure that made the highest point of the palace from what he remembered of the mini-tour they were given – he’d grabbed the shrunken gift box and Silenced his shoes before venturing out into the halls.ARian had said he didn’t need to get him anything in return for the gobstone and wizarding chess sets but that didn’t feel right.AIt wasn’t a matter of propriety – the excuse he’d used on his mother when she didn’t want to allow him to go shopping – but of what his magic was telling him.AWills’s magic had always been like a gentle guide, especially with his magical tutoring.  At least with some things.  Charms his magic helped bunches with.  He just got it.  Transfiguration on the other hand…not his best subject.AAccording to Mrs. Tonks that was because most witches and wizards were predisposed to certain magics.  They came easier, were easier to learn and understand.  A “magical prodigy” was a magical person who had no predisposition.  Those with a rich magical heritage were more likely to be magical prodigies than a person with a narrow heritage because their family magics and the instinctual knowledge that sometimes came with it had a broader spectrum to work from.AAlong with the Nimue predisposition to Charms, he also had a good head for herbology and potion making, leading Andromeda to the conclusion that perhaps he had the blood of one of the Healing families somewhere in his line.AA supposition they’d proven true when he’d gained access to the Family Vault and discovered that the last Nimue Lord before him had a Pevensie mother – a family that rose to the nobility as the official Healers of the Royal House of Pendragon.AWills had chuckled about that.AHis was definitely a Royal Marriage – his spouse was even his distant cousin.AVery, very distant.ABut then from what had been explained regarding Rian’s bloodlines…he was related to just about everyone.AAt least who were among the Noble Families of Avalon.AOutside of that not as much but his blueblood was so mixed his Bonded was going to have to be careful with who he wed within the Nobles of Avalon.AHe was spotted at last by Remus of all people, sitting in a comfortable-looking chair with its back to the wall and facing the double doors that led to the King’s Tower, a book spread open on his knee.A“Lost, your Grace?”  The golden-eyed man gave the young Lord his rightful honorific as his cub’s Bonded.  Lady Maggie would scold and tell them Wills wasn’t supposed to be referred to as such until after the wedding.  But as far as the Alpha wolf was concerned the only difference was a display for the public and a change in rooms.AThe boys were bonded.  William deserved the respect that came with it.AWills gave him what his mother called his “charming” grin.A“No,” he said holding up the shrunken gift.  “Have a present for Hadrian and I know the only chance I’m going to get to talk to him today once he wakes up is at meals.  Wanted to at least drop this off before he’s caught up in Kingdom business for the next week.”AA week was the estimate he pried out of his Grandmother’s Mr. Holmes.  That was how long his grandmother’s visit was supposed to last.  He was supposed to be able to stay until the last week of August so he could leave and get ready for school to start up.  With Rian busy getting the running of the Kingdom launched, he would mostly be getting to know Rian’s family and sneaking games of Snap with his Betrothed.  If he wanted to give his gift to Rian today before the insanity really began was his best shot.ARemus hummed non-committally, tapping one finger on the open page of his book.  Technically watching for Harry to surface was a job for the Guard but…he was hiding.  As Lord Protector there really wasn’t much he could do until some of Hadrian’s meetings with the various Ministries happened.AUntil his cub got done cherry-picking the best of the best from the Auror and Hit Wizard ranks from the different territories to create the standing-force the Lord Protector was in charge of…he really didn’t have a job since the Wards were powered by Hadrian himself and placing new ones required Hadrian’s approval.  The office of Lord Protector was equal parts Warding and maintaining a fighting force.  Neither of which was on the table at the moment.AThat didn’t stop Sherrinford as the Lord High Chancellor from bothering him about it.AHe could in turn go be a bother to McG as the Captain of the Guard since his position and the Guards they’d acquired were part of the Protectorate…but that wouldn’t be a good idea unless he fancied running around on four-paws after the Captain transfigured him into a wolf – the man’s running threat if bothered again.ABesides that McG knew more about running a Guard than Remus could learn in a lifetime.AHence the sitting outside the Tower door…hiding.A“Go on up.”  He sighed.  “But if he hexes your eyebrows off for waking him don’t say I didn’t warn you.”A“Okay.”  Wills shrugged.  Since he wasn’t hauling his Bonded out of bed for training, meditation, or lessons, he figured he would be alright.  For insurance though…A“Mipsy,” he called as he started climbing the stairs.  “Breakfast for two in…wherever is set up for breakfast in the King’s Tower.  With coffee.  Lots and lots of coffee.  And chocolate.”  He added the last after thinking a moment.ABetter safe than sorry.AThe little elf nodded and popped away.AWilliam climbed higher and higher, gaining peeks into floors decorated with a simple comfort and elegance that made the Palace surrounding him somehow change from a massive statement of magical and dynastic power into a place he would be perfectly happy to spend a Sunday afternoon playing Snap or Chess with his betrothed.AOutside the Tower the walls were made of solid cream marble ribboned with gemstone rivers in the sparkling majesty of white diamond and turquoise, emerald beryl and tourmaline.  More gems than he knew the names of created sparkling designs and intricate knotwork within the very foundations of the Palace.  He stopped abruptly then gave a laugh as he continued his climb.AIt was a focus.ASkye Palace was a massive focus.AMany people thought Godric Gryffindor mad when he used the stones from his own House’s ancient Castle in the building of Hogwarts.  Generation after generation of his family had bled, and loved, and used magic freely within the confines of the stones, charging them with ambient power before the foundations of the school were even laid.  In modern times many felt that Hogwarts had gained a kind of sentience from all the magic cast with the walls since its founding.  Those who knew thought it was rather both.AWhy Gryffindor tore down his abandoned family castle and rebuilt it beside the Forbidden Forest was now answered – at least to Wills.AWhat did Gryffindor need with a drafty castle when his real home was an unassailable fortress that was capable of being used to cast magic with devastating effect?AThat also explained how the Wards were still functioning and Avalon was still safely floating in its magical field.  Skye Palace was the giant battery that made the Wards strong and the city fly.  It was the creation of a mad, impossible genius.AAt least Wills knew Rian came by his quirks honestly.ALook at what his Family had done.AAnd what a legacy to try and live up to.AJaw set, Wills at last made it to where the Bond told him Rian was, eyes widening a bit at the sheer size of both the room and the bed.  Twenty people could sleep in that thing and not have to touch – unless they wanted to.  Wills blushed bright red at the thought before banishing it.APuberty had turned into the worst thing ever after meeting his Bonded and having to kiss him.AAt least before his hormones didn’t have anyone real to fixate on.  Just your standard athletes and supermodels and actors/actresses.ANow…AHe was too young to deal with now.ASetting the box on a wide bench set at the foot of the monstrous bed, he took out his wand – vine and black unicorn hair, twelve inches even and moderately flexible custom-made by Lord Ollivander – the black unicorn tail-hair made for a more powerful wand than unicorn tended to provide, and resized the box, with a flick he freshened the slightly-squashed bow before giving a short nod.AA grumble came from Hadrian before he cracked an eye open and rolled to his side to look at the intruder who’d set off the alert ward on the last stair landing.A“Wills?”  He asked in a sleep-fogged voice, squinting against the light-filled room.A“Good morning Rian.”  Wills gave him a bright smile.A“What’re you doin’ ‘ere?”  Hadrian wondered around a yawn before his brain kicked-in at the smell of coffee, his sleepy-green eyes shooting over to the small round breakfast table sitting off in widowed alcove, a shining silver breakfast service the origin of the life-giving smell.A“Well Rian,” Wills explained indulgently as he hopped up next to the now-sitting King.  “We were all whisked away from Buckingham Palace this morning by a troop of house elves.  Including Grandmother for some reason that is yet-to-be-explained-to-me.  Everyone else pretty much crashed once we were shown our rooms but I wanted to come surprise you.”  He waved a hand at the box and the breakfast.  “I even brought goodies…though Mipsy is responsible for the food and coffee, I just asked for it.”AHadrian gave him a crooked smile before standing at his prompting tug and moving to the table.  Inhaling a cup of caffeinated goodness he gave his bonded a genuine grin then said:  “I love that elf.”AWills gasped dramatically and shoved his shoulder lightly with his own, not spilling a drop of his own tea in the process.AThe two young Lords dug into the full-English, William sticking to his tea while after a cup of coffee Hadrian switched to the chocolate, not wanting to fry his brain-cells on the caffeine before his meetings.  They mostly chatted lightly as they filled their stomachs, Wills commiserating over the insanity of Hadrian’s guardians then Hadrian returning the favor – along with giving an unwanted apology – over William’s battling parents.A“It’s not your fault, Rian.”  Wills told him with an adult sigh.  “They were already bickering over my being magical in the first place – Father was never really too pleased over the issues it could cause the Monarchy – and other things.  That you’re a boy and not a girl isn’t something you could help and isn’t the real issue anyway.  So don’t apologize for making things difficult between my parents.”AHis bonded agreed once he saw how much the topic was hurting the older boy.  Changing the subject as their finished plates were whisked away by the elves, leaving only fresh pots of tea and chocolate in their wake, Hadrian nearly bounced over to the tempting box.  All but dancing, he waited for Wills to join him and waved indulgently to the gift before tearing off the bow and paper and tossing the top over his shoulder.A“Excited Rian?”  Wills laughed.A“Presents!”  Hadrian gave him a big grin.  “Presents are a serious business.  Especially surprise presents.  Those are the best kind.”A“I know you said I didn’t need or have to.”  William gave him a quick side-hug before freeing his bonded to explore the various brightly-packaged contents of the box.  “But I wanted to.”AHadrian made an exclaiming sound as he lifted the packages one by one from their places.AWilliam had gotten him a wide assortment of mundane puzzle games and mechanical toys.  Things he’d mentioned he liked to tinker with in one of their letters.  They helped him clear his mind and unwind from long days of lessons and politics.AEspecially the dreaded “language days” he still had to put up with.  Now that he was fluent in all the languages of Avalon Sherrinford had him working on those of his most important allies.  Before he’d hated German, then Welsh.  After learning both he had to say…not that bad compared to Japanese and Ancient Egyptian and Arabic.AThe box had held several puzzles from the Perplexus line, circuit boards, a Rubix cube, and even an erector set.AIt was once again a perfect reciprocal gift from his own of gobstones and wizarding chess.A“This is brilliant, Wills.”  Hadrian said as they sat on the floor surrounded by the games and toys.  “Thank you.”ALeaning over he gave his bonded a quick peck on the cheek, blushing lightly.ADespite the last two months of correspondence, this still was only the second time they’d met.  He just wasn’t comfortable doing anything else, even though traditionally an actual kiss was the proper “thanks” for a Courting gift following a betrothal.  It wasn’t like there was anyone there watching them from the shadows and grading them on their Courting Etiquette.AThank Merlin.AHaving an audience for their Bonding Kiss had been bad enough.AWilliam finally addressed the hippogriff in the room.A“So…”  He said looking over at the sword that was apparently unwilling to be farther than five feet away from Hadrian.  At the moment it was propped up against the side of the massive bed in a basilisk-hide sheath that had an over-the-shoulder harness attached.  The strap of the harness was embossed in mithril with the dual Crests of Avalon and Rian’s personal Crest.  Hadrian in his cotton pajama bottoms with flying snitches and Puddlemere United top wasn’t exactly dressed to have it holstered at his back.A“How much did you geek-out over having to King-Arthur Excalibur over there out of the Stone?”AHadrian collapsed in giggles onto the plush Aubosson green-and-blue rug.A“So much geeking-out on the inside.”  He finally admitted.  “On the outside I was exhausted from the Claiming, bleeding, and trying to find the energy after suddenly gaining six inches to not fall on my arse.”AWilliam nodded sagely and challenged his bonded to a game of Snap.A…ADaily Prophet Headline: August 1st 1991:AAAACorruption!  Murder!  Theft!  Embezzlement!  In the Ministry:",The Avalon Seven,108617

AvalonAA“The-Boy-Who-Lived!”AHadrian stepped up to the podium in Malfoy Manor’s main ballroom in the late evening of August Second.  The reporters were rather resembling a pack of rabid dogs slavering over the same bone.  For the last two days total control over the Ministry Scandal and Hadrian’s Royal Inheritance had laid completely with Lucius and they were eager to get a scoop on their competition.ARising a regal hand, the immaculately dressed King waited until the reporters took the hint and gradually fell silent.  Echoing the attire he wore for the pictures Lucius released, he wore black dragon-hide trousers and matching sleeveless dueling robes with a Royal-purple sleeveless acromantula silk tunic adding regal color.  Ancuru was over his shoulder and his mithril chain of office was around his neck, Lordship rings on his hands and his Cuff blazing with the flashes from the cameras.A“Before any questions are answered.”  Hadrian stared out over the crowd with his enchanting emerald gaze.  “We will give a statement.  However, it would be appreciated by the Throne if from now on We are referred to as: King Hadrian, His/Your Grace, Lord of Avalon or any of Our inherited Houses, even simply Hadrian.  The title of The-Boy-Who-Lived serves no purpose beyond that of continuously prodding the healing wound Voldemort” he ignored the shocked looks and gasps of the crowd.  “Also known as the Half-Blood Tom Marvolo Riddle left on the collective hearts and minds of Britain’s people both magical and mundane.”AHis face was solemn and clearly showed his grief and reverence for the dead.A“He killed my parents.”  He switched to the singular, making it personal if they wouldn’t accede to a request from their King.  “Tom Riddle killed my parents.  He came into the safe-house provided by Albus Dumbledore and hidden under the Fidelis by the same after being given the Secret by the still at-large Peter Pettigrew.  He cut my father down like a dog and forced my mother to beg for the life of her only child before slaughtering her before my crib.  Nothing is accomplished by celebrating my survival except stomping on the memory of my parents and the hundreds of others who did not survive.”A“If you must celebrate something.”  Hadrian’s voice gained a deep resonance as he continued.  “Celebrate life by living yourselves.  Rejoice in your lives because there are so many who no longer can.”AWaiting for the dict-a-quills and a notorious acid-green quick-notes-quill to finish scribbling he took a sip of the water Lucius handed him.A“Today We stand before you to announce the arrest of Vernon, Petunia, and Marjorie Dursley.  For those of you who are unaware Vernon and Petunia Dursley are the sister and brother-in-law of the late Lady Lilly Potter nee Evans.  Marjorie is Vernon’s sister and Petunia’s sister-in-law.  Marjorie Dursley, mundane, stands charged with seven counts of abuse of a magical child.  Vernon Dursley, mundane with magical knowledge, stands charged with fifty-nine counts of abuse of a magical child, four hundred and seven counts of neglect of a magical child, forty counts of embezzlement of funds for support of a magical child, attempted line-theft by misleading a magical child of their heritage, and attempted murder of a magical child.”AHadrian paused several minutes for the uproar that had grown louder and louder to die down once more before finishing the charges against the Dursleys.A“Petunia Dursley nee Evans, squib of the Evans Line,” pause for the uproar.  “Stands charged with three counts of attempted line theft by misleading a magical child of their heritage,” since Petunia knew about the Potter, Evans, and Pevensie families being magical and still lied.  “Fifteen counts of abuse of a magical child, seven hundred and eighty-nine counts of neglect of a magical child, forty counts of embezzlement of funds for support of a magical child, and concealing the attempted murder of a magical child.”AAnother several minutes of pandemonium and a cup of water later and Hadrian was ready to finish his announcement before taking questions.A“In the wake of these charges and the others logged every day in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement chronicling abuses against magical children in both the magical and mundane societies, We as King and Lord of Avalon do hereby announce the creation of the Child Protection Decree.  The Decree will become the benchmark by which child abuse is investigated and prosecuted within the territories of Avalon.  The full body of the Decree will be distributed at the end of this press conference.  Questions?”AHands shot up and questions were shouted in a jumbled.  Hadrian simply stood silent until they shut the hell up.  Pointing to a mousy brunette, Hadrian took the first question.A“Elspeth Smythe-Smith with Witch Weekly, Your Grace.”  She was practically bouncing.  “Yesterday we reported that you are subject to no less than thirteen Last-of-Line laws.  Have you made any decisions about how you’re going to handle what amounts to a harem of spouses?”AHadrian restrained the deep need he felt to curse both her and Lucius into oblivion.A“With my inheritance being of such magnitude I was made aware of the responsibility to my Lines and that I would need to take spouses.  However in addition to the continuation of my Lines there were also binding marriage and betrothal contracts along with that same inheritance.  So yes,” he smiled charmingly.  “In that way six of my Lines already have contracts in place and I am actively Courting my bonded-betrothed of the House of Emrys.  Next question.”ASteering clear of all women, Hadrian called on a bespectacled older wizard.A“Derringer Sweeps from Potions Quarterly, Your Grace.”  The man’s voice was low and gravely.  “Have you made any appointments to the Royal Household?  Who will be the Royal Potions Master for your Grace?”AAnd the formerly safe question was gone.A“We have retained Lord Prince as the Potions Master and Researcher to the Royal Household.  Lord Prince is the youngest Potions Master in a century and We have the utmost respect for his abilities.”A“No concerns that he’s a Death Eater?”  The infamous poison tongue of Rita Skeeter called out.  “Or about your pet Death Eater that keeps handing Your Lordship water?”AHadrian arched a brow.  “Ah you must be the slanderous Ms. Skeeter.  Lord Malfoy would you mind…?”A“Not at all, Your Grace.”  Lucius gave a smirk before shrugging off his outer-robes and holding up his unblemished left arm for all to see.A“Any other questions?”A…AThe next morning before heading into another day of trying to negotiate with the holdouts from Russia, Hadrian took some time to handle a housekeeping issue.AIt was official he had to appoint a Head Chatelaine and another over at least his properties private and royal in the U.K.AHe looked up as Russell announced his guest, who he’d sent Tristan to collect that morning.A“Dowager Lady Longbottom, your Grace.”A“Lady Augusta.”  Hadrian came around the desk and gave her a kiss on the hand before pulling out one of the custioned desk chairs in his formal Study in the State Rooms of the West Wing of Skye Palace.  “It’s wonderful to see you again.”AOver the last several years Hadrian had grown close to her grandson Neville, Heir Longbottom, through their combination social/study group at the Wallace Estate.  Though he hadn’t had much contact with the Dowager he had had occasion to meet her previously.  And learn the story surrounding her son and daughter-in-law’s tragedy.A“Your Grace,” Augusta gave him a proper curtsy before taking the offered seat.  “It’s an honor that you’ve requested a meeting at the dawn of your Reign.  With how busy you must be between gutting the Ministry, seeking the blood of your abusers, and being named Witch Weekly’s “Most Eligilbe Wizard”.  What can House Longbottom do for the Kingdom of Avalon?”AHadrian hid a grin at the Dowager’s peppery commentary of the media blitz Lucius was orchestrating.A“House Longbottom can reclaim their empty estate in Avalon Proper.”  Hadrian arched a brow.  “However that is not the purpose of this meeting.  Both We as a Kingdom and I as Lord need a Head Chatelaine.  Desperately.”  He added with a sigh.  “I desperately need a Head Chatelaine.”AAugusta pursed her lips.  That was no small thing.  As a Dowager and a Daughter of House Prewett, she was well aware of the scope of what he was asking.  And then there were others beside herself to consider.  As Head Chatelaine she would be a member of the Royal Household and would need to live in Avalon and make herself available to the King.  She would also have to coordinate with the other individual Chatelaines the King would appoint over certain residences or regions.  No matter how she felt about them personally.AAs well as dealing with the other members of the Royal Household and the Privy Council to prepare the Royal Residences or assist with planning Royal Events at the locations under her purview.AThankfully there wasn’t a massive staff to coordinate.  House Elves tended to manage themselves once they were aware of where and what needed doing.A“I am hesitant to accept.”  She began only to stop at a gesture from the young King.A“If your concern is for the continued health of your son and daughter-in-law rest assured that has been taken into account.”  Hadrian told her before she could formally decline.  “We are prepared to have them moved to either the Royal Infirmary or a suite in the Avalonian Longbottom Estate.  The Royal Healer Andromeda Tonks nee Black is prepared to take over their care.  Combined with the services of the Royal Potions Master and Researcher, We can guarantee they won’t receive better care even at St. Mungo’s.”A“Very well, your Grace.”  Augusta conceded to the determined young man with a regal nod of her own.  “I shall make arrangements with the House Elves for Longbottom Grange to be closed and the Avalonian Estate opened.  Which of the Royal Residences needs seeing to first?”A“The Head of the Avalonian House Elves is Lop.”  Hadrian smiled and handed over a thick file.  “You will need to coordinate with Lady Margeaux Holmes nee Hawkins who is the Chatelaine of Our Welsh properties,” though he hadn’t officially sworn her in to the office yet.  “To prepare the former Emrys Seat of Snowdon Castle for the Lordship Ball on the Fall Equinox.  And with the Captain of the Guard to secure port-keys for the transfer of your belongings and people to the Longbottom Estate.”AOne massive headache off his plate, Hadrian dismissed the Dowager with a smile and a polite goodbye before taking a few moments to send off notes to Tristan, McG, and Andy about the new Chatelaine before joining Siger and Sherrinford with trying to rein in the Russians.A…ABy the time the press of the wizarding world had thoroughly danced on the corpses of the not-yet-executed Cornelius Fudge and Bartemeius Crouch, they’d overlooked many of the quiet political maneuvers Hadrian and his Privy Council had used to solidify his rule of Avalon.ANo one was talking about the Lord High Justice of Avalon also being the Interim Minsiter for Magic.  They were far too busy being outraged over the dirty dealings and blatant bribery of Fudge.AThere was no discussion about the widespread reforms then pushed down the collective throats of the remaining ministry officials.  They were too busy worrying over whether keeping their jobs after the clean-out.  Especially when many of the now-deposed officials had been brought up on criminal charges.AAnd the public was much too outraged over the abuse against their now-beloved King to care that he had basically created a blanket decree over how they were allowed to treat children.AWhen they weren’t being outraged over child abuse or the ministry scandals, they were in love with the young, regal, handsome King Hadrian.AWitches young and old either wanted to marry him or wanted their daughter or son to marry him.AAnd he was so forgiving, taking on the tarnished reputations of Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape and raising them to the highest positions of service to the Throne.AHadrian gave Lucius use of Slytherin’s Avalonian Estate named Basilisk’s Den for his family’s residence while he was in residence at Skye Palace and made Lady Malfoy Chatelaine of his English and non-territorial properties.A…AThe morning of the move from Prince Manor to Skye Palace, Severus Snape-Prince sat down with his twins at breakfast, prepared to completely upend their world view.AOnce the plates had been cleared and his son and daughter were talking idly about school and their friends, Severus set down his cup of tea and cleared his throat.ABoth raven’s-wing-black heads turned to face him, curious expressions on their fourteen year old faces.  Severus’s twins were a Slytherin (Octavian) and a Ravenclaw (Livia) both going into their second year at Hogwarts.  His lovely Livia was the picture of her late mother and was set on being a Charms Mistress and Researcher for the Unspeakables.  However his son who looked like a younger, much more refined and handsomer version of his father wanted to study Alchemy and experimental potioneering.AAnd now he was going to have to tell both of them that those goals and dreams of their laid in the hands of someone else.A“As you are both aware,” Severus folded his hand in front of him.  This wasn’t anything he was prepared for.  His father wasn’t worthy of the name, being a drunken, abusive asshole.  His mother was so beaten down the best parenting she was capable of was giving him her old potions textbooks.  His wife dying giving him his children left him cast adrift.  They didn’t come with a set of instructions or a manual.  All he could do was his best.  And right now that was put on his “Head of House” face and get it over with.  “The Most Ancient and Noble House of Prince came to England’s shore as ambassadors.  Part of that duty included a marriage contract that remained dormant for centuries after it was signed.  In fact it went inactive for so long that neither I nor my predecessor were aware of it.”ALeave it to his clever girl to put the pieces together.A“Which one of us is the property of the King?”  The Snape Snark was alive and well in his daughter’s hands.ATavi and Livia watched him with the same narrow-eyed glare that he’d used for years on hopeless dunderheads in his classroom.A“Octavian.”  Severus let out a breath.  “After Hadrian met with me and informed me about the contract I went and searched through the Prince Family archives.  The contract is binding and unbreakable.  However,”ALivia who had let out a breath, whipped her head back around and stared at him with wide eyes.  Octavian had lowered his head into his hands and hunched forward, removing him from blocking her line of sight to accuse her father with her mother’s eyes.A“It’s not the only contract the Prince Family had forgotten.”  He heaved a sigh.  “You know the story.  Your Grandmother Eileen…”A“Ran off with a muggle.”  Livia pressed her hands to her mouth, eyes tearing.  “Rather than marry Abraxas Malfoy, the then second-son of the House of Malfoy.  So I…?”A“Yes,” Severus winced.  “The contract was never fully enacted.  My mother ran off before her betrothal ceremony making the contract viable onto the next daughter of House Prince.  No one knew.  Not even your godparents Lucius and Narcissa knew.  As of Draco’s birth you were bound to him.  And no one had any idea.  This isn’t what I wanted for you,” Severus tearfully told his children.  “Arranged marriages and binding contracts.  Neither of us wanted this for you,” he said referencing his late wife.  “But it is what it is.”AWatching them for signs of…something…other than just uncomprehending stares, Severus laid his hands flat on the table and pushed himself to his feet.A“With my position with the Royal Household we will be making our home wherever the King is in residence.  We leave for Skye Palace in Avalon this afternoon.  I have directed our elves to meet each of you in your rooms and assist with your packing.”ABefore he could stride from the room, he was stopped in his tracks by the sound of his son’s question.A“What’s he like?”  Tavi asked, lifting his head from his hands to stare at his father with a mirror image of his own eyes only in slate-grey, a halfway point between Severus’s black and Astrid’s ice-blue.  “Hadrian?”ASeverus paused for several long moments.A“Like a King.”  He finally answered.  “The Hadrian I met was very like a King.”A…AAcross the globe in The Empire of the Rising Sun, Emperor Hiro Ryuunosuke, sixty-seventh Emperor of the Empire of the Rising Sun, on the morning after the Claiming, felt the Wards protecting his Palace rise and strengthen in a matter of seconds.ACalling out for his manservant, he sent for the ambassador from the British and his favorite falcon letter-bearer and scribe.AThe Wards of Avalon had done nothing but weaken since the last of their Royal Lines was Lost.  That they would suddenly tremble and shake with fresh power meant only one thing.  His most powerful ally had once again awoken.AAnd with them came new hope for magic everywhere, for like the now defunct mundane British Empire, that of Avalon was one that spanned the world over.ATo them, the sun never did truly set nor was Lady Magic ever forgotten.AIt was time to send a letter.A…AAt that same moment in Egypt, a hawk winged its way from the Royal Seat in Thebes to the Summer Palace in Alexandria bearing with it great tidings of strange happenings.A…AWhile Severus was struggling his domestic issues and Avalon’s allies were scrambling for answers from their current ambassadors – beyond those found in the press – another father was having a difficult conversation with his own children.AGawain Wallace was finally going to have a conversation he’d been putting off for two years.  Hadrian had grown tired of his waffling and had given him an ultimatum: tell them or Hadrian would.A“Boys,” he began with a sigh.  “There’s something I’ve been keeping from you…”A…AGawain and David stared after Rhys as he stormed from the room, thunder-clouds crashing across his face.AThe father turned to his older son and asked:A“Do you think he actually heard anything I just said?”ADavid stared after his brother for several long moments.  Rhys had distanced himself more and more from him since he’d left for school.  Then he’d nearly cut their father out of his life altogether after he sent their mother away.  Rhys had always been closer to her.AHearing that one of them was to be bound in a marriage not of their choosing…AA  He wouldn’t be surprised if Rhys had tuned everything out after that initial revelation and he told his father as such.  Adding:AA“He wouldn’t be so enraged if he knew Hadrian was the groom.  He’s still hurt that his best-friend kept his status from us all our lives, and he’s bloody furious with you over it, but Rhys would realize that being a King’s Consort is the best he ever could’ve done for himself.  Besides being possibly bonded to his best-friend…at least we’d all know either me or Rhys wouldn’t be abused.”A“Do you think anything penetrated that thick skull besides the possible betrothal?”A“No.”  David sighed.  “And if anything it was the bit about how it could be broken.”A“Balls.”A“Yep.”AHeir Wallace hesitated, not sure if now would be the best time but if he didn’t ask soon there might never be a time if Hadrian decided on him instead of his brother before he even ventured the question.A“Dad?”  His voice was cautious.  “I need to ask you something…”A…AIn a reversal of events from a week before, Hadrian found himself slipping quietly through the halls of Skye Palace, on his way to the East Wing where he’d assigned the Windsors and Mycroft apartments for use during their visit(s).AThough he wasn’t alone and it wasn’t a clandestine act, Hadrian was enjoying just being able to stroll through his new home without running into one of the Privy Council who desperately needed him to sign or approve something or one of the ruddy politicians or reporters his days had been filled with.AFor the most part the territories of Avalon – including their new “sister” country in the U.S. of A. – were now aware and assenting of the new chain of command.  Only Russia continued to be problematic and that had more to do with their mundane counterpart than it did the Russian Premier of Magic.  The various heads-of-state had the plans and reforms for their countries that he and his guardians had worked tirelessly on for years and the two camps – he and his Privy Council and the heads-of-state – had decided on timelines for implementation for various reforms and laws to be fully in place.ABritain was going to require a heavier hand but both they – his Privy Council – and he had known that.  The education reforms were going to be the worst.  As things stood mundane-born witches and wizards weren’t contacted soon enough and enrolled in a wizarding institution of learning young enough to prevent unnecessary breaching to the International Statute of Secrecy.  In fact according to the numbers Sherrinford had used his contacts at the ICW to obtain, Britain itself was the biggest perpetrator of breaches to the SoS.  A massive problem with a simple solution:AContact early, at the first sign of accidental magic and then educate, educate, educate.AThe more practiced a witch or wizard becomes the rarer the acts of accidental magic.  Period.  There was no excuse for eleven and twelve year olds to be running around blowing up their schoolmates and changing the color of their teacher’s hair when the public wizarding primary schools begin enrollment for gifted students as early as five.  The public wizarding education system had mainly been created after the fall of Grindelwald to educate mundane-borns and the poorest of wizarding children.  There was even a school-supply grant funded by a portion of the exhorbitant tuition of Hogwarts to provide the necessary books and supplies to those who can’t afford it.AThere was zero reason why any mundane-born who had been identified through magic usage should remain uneducated until eleven.  There just wasn’t.AEven if they couldn’t afford Hedwig Institute at eleven there were public and subsidized schools that provided alternatives, the same for Hogwarts and secondary education up to OWLS or NEWTS.  If a student doesn’t meet the qualifications for a scholarship or grant to attend the two best centers of learning in Britain: H.I. followed by Hogwarts, there were other options.  Options that weren’t being effectively utilized by the percentage of the population they were there to help.AEducation at Hedwig was expensive, approximately one hundred fifty-three thousand dollars American per year for an Heir-level education, ninety-one thousand for a Noble-born’s education, and sixty-one thousand for a commonor’s or mundane-born’s education.  Hogwarts was better as it catered to a wider pool, costing over seventy-five thousand dollars American per year up to OWLS, just over one-hundred thousand dollars per year from OWLS to NEWTS, and between one hundred and thirty thousand to over two hundred thousand dollars from NEWTS on while undergoing an Apprenticeship.AOriginally he’d wanted to just lower the price-tag on tuition but he was quickly convinced otherwise.  Noble parents, such as his own deceased father and mother, wouldn’t enroll their children in H.I. and Hogwarts from birth including paying a nearly million-dollar price in advance for anything less than a million-dollar education.  Lowering the tuition or creating a sliding scale based on income wouldn’t do anything but drive more parents to have their children educated outside the country.  Instead they all were able to agree to adding more public – and therefor free – schools as well as adding at least one more subsidized school.  It would create the ability to take on more students without diminishing the gleam on H.I. and Hogwarts – whose hefty tuitions helped pay for the free and reduced tuitions of the public and subsidized schools while those same snotty Nobles who wouldn’t send their kids to H.I. and Hogwarts if they weren’t ridiculously expensive price gave donations to fund the school-supply, grant, and scholarship funds at all three educational tiers.AHe got his way – and didn’t – during the education debates.AHogwarts was going to be forced to add more classes and undergo reviews of its current staff as well as comply with the new teaching-regulations over just who is allowed to teach what.AThe old laws – before they’d been gutted – had stipulated teachers and professors must have a Mastery in their subjects.  When public schooling became viable, that was lowered.  Originally a teacher would need to be at least undergoing an Apprenticeship with a Master in their Subject to teach.  Then it became needing a NEWT.  As things stood, in some cases a teacher would only need a passing OWL.AThat didn’t come even close to being acceptable.AUnder the new law there would have to be a Master as the Head of Department with all of their subordinates being Apprentices – up to OWLS.  To teach NEWT-level subjects and beyond they’d have to be Masters in their own right.  There were many similar reforms coming.  All of them dealt with important subjects like class sizes, teaching wages, and curriculum.APersonally he couldn’t wait for the old goat to find out he was on probation – and was quite happy he’d won the coin-toss over who was going to tell him.  The Privy Council would be making a visit to Hogwarts this week – along with the Board – to discuss the new education reforms with the Headmaster and Staff.  Hadrian couldn’t decide which would be better – telling the Headmaster he was on probation though he’d wanted to just sack him.  Sherrinford and Siger had advised patience.  Sacking a still moderately-popular man like Dumbledore was a different thing entirely than executing a despised Minister.  They wanted to give him enough robe to hand himself – in public – before lopping of his proverbial head.AProbation or the new course subjects….and the teachers who’d been retained to help teach current subjects as well as new ones…he wasn’t sure which would have the old man keeling over but Hadrian rather hoped it was one of the new subjects.ADumbledore had imposed his own beliefs on the British magical populace for far too long.  By the time Thursday and their meeting rolled around, the first wave of reforms including some on restricted magic and the education reforms, would already be in place.  And there was nothing Dumbles could do about it.AHadrian shook his head, clearing his thoughts as the approached the Windsors’ section of the East Wing, stepping into the main sitting room that opened up into the halls leading to the four apartments they’d been given: Queen and Prince Philip, William’s parents, Wills himself, and Prince Harry, he smiled as he heard Harry’s piping young voice asking his older brother why they had to wake up so early.A“Well,” Hadrian answered for his Bonded, drawing all eyes towards where he stood framed by the cream-and-lavender plasterwork that hid the stone-and-gem walls in this part of the Palace.  “I thought you might like to see what it was Wills inherited.  In Avalon anyway,” he corrected himself with a smile.  “Wills told me you’ve already been to the Nimue holdings in Aquitaine.”A“That is most considerate of you, your Grace.”  Charles said with a polite nod.  “I assume by how you’re dressed and how we were requested to dress that we’ll be riding to our destination.”AHadrian glanced down at his simple cream leather riding breeches tucked into his highly-polished black dragonhide boots.  His cream tunic blended seamlessly with his pants, a black leather long-sleeved jacket tossed lightly on top to protect him from the wind.  The others were all dressed similarly, though the ladies were wearing old-fashioned carriage dresses with light cloaks.  Altogether, they looked like they’d stepped out of a Regency novel.A“Not quite.”  He smiled offering his arm to his Bonded and leading the way to the stables.  “You’ll have to forgive the secrecy…but it’s a surprise.”A…AAnd what a surprise it was.AThe party – save Hadrian – gasped at the sight of the lovely ivory carriage with royal-purple trim.  It had a hard top which was vanished with a wave of Hadrian’s hand for the day was lovely and bright, and was harnessed to a gorgeous pair of matched white Abraxans.  Smiling he asked permission before keying them into the enchantments on the carriage and steeds.A“The carriage and Abraxans are a gift.”  He cast a look at his bonded from under his lashes.  “When you all leave here you wouldn’t be able to return without some difficulty save for Wills.  With the carriage and steeds, you can visit any time you please.  Or if you tire of being in the Palace Wills can open up the Nimue estate so you can travel to and from Skye Palace as you please.”  He held up a hand when it seemed like they would voice objections.  “I insist.  Both carriage and steeds have been Charmed so that unless you know about them you can’t see or feel them.  Your magical guards will be able to summon them for you at any time or Wills can.  Consider it my way of lessening the inevitable distance between my Bonded and his family.”A“Thank you, Hadrian.”  Elizabeth said, reaching over and giving his hand a squeeze.  “This was very thoughtful of you.”AAfter the carriage and Abraxans had thoroughly been exclaimed over, everyone but Wills and Charles decided to ride in it, preferring to join Hadrian on horseback.AThough they had a moment of indecision as the horses they were led to didn’t look like any they’d ridden before.AHadrian grabbed Wills’s hand and led him over to a pair of stunning Pegasi, one black and one white.  Lifting their joined hands, Hadrian encouraged his Bonded to pet the white before ushering Charles over to a palomino Pegasus mare, introducing her as Celeste to the Prince and getting him situated in the saddle and casting the necessary spells to keep him locked in place no matter who much turbulence there might be after leaving the ground.  Returning to the white, Hadrian stood back and watched the picture his sandy-haired and blue-eyed Bonded made, petting and exclaiming over the pure white winged horse.A“Do you like him?”  Hadrian asked, drawing Wills’s attention.A“He’s beautiful.”  Wills responded immediately.  “I’ve never seen anything like him, not even Grandmum’s new Abraxans.  What’s his name?”A“You tell me.”  The ebony-haired boy said as he hopped up into his Pegasus – Asterion’s – back.  “He’s yours.”A“Mine?”  Wills asked in awe, turing to stare the magnificent creature in the face.  “Mine.”  He breathed.  “Thank you, Hadrian.  This is too much.”A“Nothing is too much for my bonded and future Consort.”  Hadrian gave a half-grin when Wills rolled his eyes over his response.  “What are you going to name him?”A“Apollo,” he decided as he gained his own seat.  “His color is light a ray of pure sunlight.  So Apollo.”A“Wonderful.”  Hadrian smiled and gave the order to move out to the troop of guards that were accompanying them on their tour of Avalon and picnic at the Nimue Estate.A…AAvalon was a massive undertaking.  Consisting of dozens of floating islands of various size – the largest being Avalon City at exactly four miles in circumfrance with the second largest being the one-mile oblong that contained Skye Palace – all of which were artificial.  Constructed from solid stone on surface lands of both the Emrys and Pendragon territories, they were designed, built, and completely functional before they were raised to their home in the sky.AIt was the single largest magical act – ever.ARaising Avalon took the combined efforts of LeFey’s Arithmancy and Spell Weaving, Pendragon’s Blood Magicks, and Emrys’s Enchanting and sheer, raw power.AAltogether the dozens of islands still serve the same purposes as when they were fashioned thousands of years ago.  There were the main islands of Avalon City – containing homes, schools, warehouses, and embassies all sitting empty – and Skye Palace in addition to the thirteen islands of the absent Royal and Utmost Ancient and Noble Houses who all had private estates save for House Emrys as whether they were sitting on the Throne or not, Skye Palace was always the home of the House of Emrys.  Avalon was self-sustaining which meant farms and ranches and greenhouses all currently being maintained by house elves.AAnd then there were the parks and preserves.ASpecies thought long-extinct – such as the Snidget on whom the snitch was modelled after in Qudditch – were easily spotted at any one of the dozen wildlife parks or wildflower fields or forests that made their way seamlessly through the air.AAs for preserves…AIf it had wings…it had a home in Avalon.AIncluding the inhabitants of Avalon’s six dragon rookeries.AOpaleyes, Vipertooths, Short-Snouts, and Horntails all made their homes on Avalon’s islands as well as many, many more.AThestrals too, with Avalon’s herd easily outpacing the one kept by the half-giant Hagrid at Hogwarts.AAll in all, his future Consort – and his future in-laws, were suitably impressed with the Seat of the Avalonian Empire.AEven more so when they finally laid eyes on the beautiful and elegant Nimue estate, which was shining and oh-so-welcoming in the bright August sun.A…A“This was a wonderful idea, Rian.”  Wills whispered to his betrothed, their heads tilted together as they ambled through the green and lush grape vines of the Nimue vineyard.  “None of us have had much time to relax lately.”  He confided, shooting a furtive glance at his parents who were happily walking together just up the hill from them, talking to a fascinating little elf name Muscat about the vineyard and its history.AFor once, Diana and Charles had left their steadily-increasing tense relationship in private, acting like the loving parents Wills had always had.  Elizabeth and Philip had stayed behind at the picnic sight atop one of the estate’s hills that looked over most of the Avalonian Islands.  The Nimue Estate was one of the outermost of the floating chain with only the dragon preserves farther afield from the central islands containing Avalon City and Skye Palace – though the Palace made up the highest point of the chain and looked over all the rest.AOnce they were out of earshot of their minders – both parental and guards – and Harry had wandered off to try his hand a picking some of the just-ripening grape harvest, Hadrian had whispered to Wills that due to Skye containing the Ward Chamber deep within the Palace as well as having the most complex of the runic arrays of all the islands it had to be highest.  Many thought or would think that it was a statement of power and it was that, Skye being a formidable and stunning sight no matter whether seen from within or without, but mostly it was to make the most efficient use of the power it took to keep Avalon flying.  Since the Royal Families of Avalon were the ones charged with both protecting the main Ward Stones as well as charging them it made sense to keep them within Skye.  And since they were already expensing massive amounts of power to keep the Wards running, putting Skye in the center and above the rest of the islands made for the easiest distribution of power from the main Ward stones to the lesser Ward stones that powered both Avalon and their security systems around the world.AAll sensitive information.ABut if Hadrian couldn’t trust his bonded – who by the very nature of their bond was literally bound to keep his trust and secrets – with the reason of why Skye was in the center of the island array there would be no one he ever could trust that way.AAnd Hadrian wasn’t willing to turn into that king, who kept his secrets and his confidence to himself alone, never letting anyone in and eventually turning into a paranoid old miser.AHe’d pass.AAnd pass on his trust to Wills – who swore he would keep it safe.AThey were quickly turning into each other’s closest confidants and bedrocks of support – and Hadrian wouldn’t have it any other way.A…AThe day before Hadrian’s “visit” to Hogwarts saw him making his way from a strategy meeting with his closest Councilmembers – namely his former guardians and his honorary uncles – to the East Wing.AQueen Elizabeth as well as Prince Philip and Prince Charles had departed back to Buckingham Palace to see to their obligations to their country – and keep an eye on how well Mr. Major was bumping along after his introduction to Hadrian and the new policies regarding magical children born to their mundane citizens.ADiana and the young Princes however had stayed on.AWills and Hadrian were both excited, having previously been told that the visit would only last a week to ten days.  With Diana’s permission – mainly due to the Princess having a way to return to England to keep up her duties without leaving her sons alone in a strange Palace, thanks to Hadrian’s gift – the original timeline had been extended, taking them all the way up to the weekend before school commenced.  Harry was over the moon, reveling in being able to learn all about the magical world and being able to play with magical creatures of the benign sort.  Though the younger Prince was put-out when he was told that no gift of a flying horse was in the offing for him.AHadrian had a solid hour before he was needed anywhere for anything and was hoping to spend it playing games or just getting to know Wills better.  He thought it was safe to say that they were friends at this point but they still had miles and miles to go before they were anywhere near ready to progress their relationship in less than two years.  Normally if Wills wasn’t there he’d spend the free time practicing music or Krav Maga or drawing.  He didn’t paint much but he did like to sketch sometimes to take his mind off of more engrossing things like music and his studies.AHis meeting had been in the West Wing which had the “State” rooms which meant he had to hike all the way across the Palace to get to Wills’s apartment in the East Wing.  For now.  When they were married Wills would be moved to one of the consort rooms in or attached to the Kings Tower…whatever he preferred.  They might even share Hadrian’s quarters.  It really depended on what Wills was comfortable with especially with Hadrian having to take multiple consorts.AAs Hadrian was cutting across the intersection that met the corridor to the South Wing and Tower in a T, he heard his name called out.  Or one of his “names” anyway.A“Your Grace!”AHadrian had never heard that voice before though it sounded very similar to one he’d spent some time around recently.  He just couldn’t place the resemblance.AThat lasted until he turned around.A“Your Grace.”  The voice said again much more reservedly as he lifted his head to look at the face that matched the smooth voice and slender body clad in all-black dueling robes much like the ones Hadrian had made popular overnight in his photos in the wizarding press.AIt was a handsome face with very patrician features coupled with dark slate-grey eyes and a long fall of straight black hair that rivalled his own for length.A“Allow me to introduce myself, your Grace.”  Something between a smile and a smirk tugged at thin lips.  “My name is Octavian Prince, and I’m your betrothed.”",The Avalon Seven,108617

DefenseAAHadrian looked up from studying the newcomer, startled.A“Betrothed?”  He questioned a moment before switching gears completely from work to personal.  “Prince.”  He took a breath.  “Octavian Prince, your Lord Prince’s son.”ATavi’s half-smile became a full-on smirk.A“Contracted-betrothed.”  Tavi corrected himself.  Though he was starting to think it wouldn’t be the life-ending incident he’d originally assumed.  An assumption his father’s description hadn’t helped.  Like a King didn’t exactly inspire the best thoughts in a fourteen year old about their new future spouse.  But Tavi was unashamedly-bent and Hadrian while still young for him, was adorable with his big jewel-toned eyes and startled expression.  Like a fawn who’d caught sight of the big-bad-wolf.  “My father told me last week, your Grace.”A“Lord Prince and I discussed the betrothal.”  Hadrian rocked back on his heels, tucking his hands into his pants pocket.  Octavian made him…nervous.  Wills had never made him so…skittish.  Not once they actually met.  Octavian and William were turning out to be total opposites – including in looks.AThe idea of William – both as a person and a Prince and Lord in his own right and as the person he’s supposed to marry first – turned out to be far more nerve-wracking than Wills actually was.  In person William-the-idea became Wills-the-boy, a much easier to deal with person and friend than some murky idea of a future consort.AOctavian on the other hand…AHe was bold and confident, striding up and demanding Hadrian’s attention both as a King and as his future-spouse.  There would be no waiting for his father to arrange a properly-planned and orchestrated introduction with Octavian.  Just him charging ahead and taking his life in his own hands.AHadrian appreciated that, even as the smirk on that chiseled face and the look in Octavian’s slate-grey eyes made him highly aware that this was someone not only older and more mature than him but also someone who had clear ideas over how their betrothal was going to go.AIdeas Hadrian was quite certain he wasn’t ready to hear yet.A“I hope you don’t mind terribly that I’ve ignored protocol, your Grace.”  Tavi could see that he was making the younger boy nervous and with his nature he couldn’t help but tease him at least a little, using the Voice he inherited – along with a lot of other things – from his father to purr over the honorific, making a light blush dust ivory cheeks.  “But I wanted to meet you and give you a small token to show my compliance with the betrothal.  Without everyone and my father watching us like a potions experiment about to explode.”AThe King of Avalon laughed at how accurately Octavian Prince had pegged his and William’s first official introduction.  Of course theirs occurred during their betrothal rites so that added several layers of tension for all involved.  He and Octavian would’ve been introduced sometime before the other boy left for Hogwarts in September, if that is, his new Potions Master had requested it or told him he’d informed his son of the contract.AThe rest of what Octavian said breeched Hadrian’s mind.A“A token?”  He furrowed his brow confused.  “According to the contract I’m supposed to court you.”  He paused for a moment, eyeing the other boy before deciding on blunt honesty.  Octavian Prince seemed like the type to appreciate it.  “Something I did tell your father I wasn’t ready for yet.  I’m currently courting my bonded-betrothed and trying to get my Kingdom in order.  To be blunt I don’t have time to Court you properly Octavian.  Besides we’ve years yet before we have to be bonded.”AOctavian waved a long-fingered hand in a dismissive but elegant motion.A“I’ll be at school most of the time anyway.”  He shrugged leanly-muscled shoulders.  “And I’m not some proper lady who needs a gentle-Knight to come and sweep me off my feet.  I want to get a dual Mastery in Alchemy and Potions.  I don’t have a lot of time either but I thought if we started slow now and got to know each other when possible it would make things easier later.  To that end,” he presented a crystal phial with a flourish.AHadrian took it hesitantly, not sure about being Courted versus doing the Courting.  “Perhaps we both could take turns being ‘in charge’ of the Courtship.”  He mused more to himself than his companion as he studied the shimmery liquid he could just see through the crystal.  That didn’t stop Tavi from hearing and giving a hidden grin.AThe new King of Avalon was just too fecking cute.AAnd he was Octavian’s.AWell, the budding Alchemist and Potioneer corrected himself with a light scowl he hid from the King.  His and his bonded-betrothed at the moment.  Octavian didn’t like to share, often not even with his twin.  That he was going to have to share his husband with at least a dozen others chafed.AHence his plan.AToss aside protocol and make certain Hadrian if not loved him at least valued him.  That desire to be valued in his future marriage was the main reason he chose the initial courting gift he did.  Even if Hadrian had no interest himself in potions or alchemy, Octavian could provide things with them that other spouses or betrotheds couldn’t unless they were alchemists or had Severus Snape for a father.A“It’s a sight-perfecting potion.”  Octavian offered when Hadrian’s emerald gaze looked up at him in question.  “I’d heard stories from my father about his friend Lily and her ‘glasses-wearing-git’ of a husband both from when they were just starting Hogwarts and through school.  So I decided to invent this.”  He flicked an elegant finger at the phial.  “Seven drops in each eye will correct even the worst vision.  I know you don’t wear glasses but with my potion you’ll still gain perfect vision.  It helps with vision issued caused by injury or aging as well.”AHadrian looked at the tiny bottle in his hand with awe.A“And you created this?”  He asked, nearly unable to believe it.  “Why haven’t you patented it or published your work?”AOctavian shrugged and explained.A“I’m not a Potions Master or even an Apprentice.  Even with Severus Snape as a father I’m still ineligible for my Mastery until I pass my NEWTS.  Anything I patents or publish before that doesn’t count.  I’d get credit, yes and if I patent it I’d get paid either for the recipe or to make it but it wouldn’t be worth as much as it would once I’ve either entered an apprenticeship or challenged the test for my Mastery.  By waiting any potions I make will count as credit towards my Mastery credentialing and will be worth more.  It’s an irritating reality but it is what it is.”AHis betrothed frowned fiercely, hand wrapping protectively around the phial.A“That’s ageist.”  He hissed eyes narrowed, looking much to Tavi’s amused gaze like an irritated kitten.  “I should fix it.”  Hadrian nodded firmly.  “You shouldn’t have to wait just because some arbitrary rule says you’re too young to do something amazing.”APleased with the defense, though it was unneeded, Tavi nonetheless held up a hand, stopping his King before he could go off on a rant or rush off to make a Royal Decree.A“The rule is there for a reason no matter how annoying it is right now.”  Octavian told him firmly.  “It keeps shoddy hacks from selling hodge-podge messes of potions to the unsuspecting populace.  By having the NEWTS requirement restricting the price of non-Masters of the craft, it helps protect the average witch and wizard.  Besides it’s only three more years until I’m eligible to start an apprenticeship or challenge for my Mastery.”AHadrian studied him carefully, judging the words and finding them true, at least from Octavian’s perspective.  He still was going to talk to Lord Prince about this.  There should be a way for young, skilled potioneers like Octavian to get credit towards their Mastery for potions they invent before taking their NEWTS.  He’d have to see what if anything could be done about it.A“Thank you for this, Heir Prince.”  Hadrian settled on saying, leaving out his plans regarding his contracted-betrothed’s father.  “It is an amazing gift.”A“You’re welcome, your Grace.”  Tavi gave a small smile.  “And please, call me Octavian or Tavi.  Anything but ‘Heir Prince’” He asked genuinely.A“Octavian.”  Hadrian returned his smiled.  “Please call me Hadrian, unless it’s a formal event.  Then unfortunately it has to be one of my honorifics.”A“Hadrian.”  Tavi all-but-purred smirking in amusement over the bright-red blush that crashed into downy cheeks.A…AHadrian did eventually make it to see William though it was more of a quick snack with tea than the leisurely game of Snap and talking he’d planned.AHe’d spent more time talking with Octavian than he’d realized.AAfter his meetings for the day were over, most revolving around the coming visit to Hogwarts and education reform with a half-hour music practice thrown in where he barely got to play a set of scales and one piece on his violin and cello.  His piano – well Lady Maggie’s piano – had been moved from Ravenscroft Hill to the estate the Holmes had been given to use while both Holmes Lords were on the Privy Council.  He’d turned over the Ravenclaw Royal estate/retreat of Raven’s Roost to his former guardians, moving in both Sherrinford and Siger and their wives and Sherrinford’s children to the floating island.  As members of the Privy Council, as long as they were within Avalon’s wards they could apparate (Sherrinford) or take a port-key (Siger) to the main entry courtyard of Skye Palace.  Having them at one of the many empty estates gave Hadrian a bit more independence and the former guardians more privacy without having to worry about seeing random dignitaries or ambassadors or just Hadrian and William gadding about the palace – a sight fit to give Sherrinford’s wife Lady Holmes heart palpitations over the impropriety of it.ABesides which Hadrian never really took to Sherrinford’s wife and children, a feeling that was very much returned.AThey were too…staid, for the independent-minded monarch.AHaving them somewhere other than his home just made sense.AHadrian made sure to talk to Lord Prince about the potion Octavian gave him.  It wasn’t that he thought his future-spouse would intentionally harm him – at least he hoped not – but felt it was better not to blindly trust him regardless.  With Lord Prince’s approval of the potion and Severus’s help dropping the required amount in each eye, Hadrian’s okay vision was perfect by the time he woke the next morning.AThanks to improved nutrition and being under a Healer’s care after being rescued by John and Sherlock Hadrian’s vision hadn’t continued to degrade after age four but some damage had been done.  Not enough to really justify glasses or other measure but enough to be irritating at times when he was forced to take breaks earlier than others when reading a text or music.  Thankfully the potion didn’t fully activate until Hadrian went to sleep or the sudden improvement would’ve been greatly disorienting.AWills had been interested in Octavian’s gift and suitably interested that the older boy had taken the initiative to meet his contracted-betrothed.AIt reminded him a great deal of Hadrian’s own personal “mutiny” over their own formal introduction and betrothal, though much more bold in its planning and execution.AThe Nimue Lord was left feeling very…ambiguous about the whole thing.AOn one hand there was someone who was attempting to take way from Wills’ own time with his betrothed.ABut on the other, Octavian did have a right to get to know Hadrian just as he did.AHe wasn’t sure how to feel about the whole thing or even what he was supposed to think about it but he did know that until he made a decision regarding this thoughts and feelings one way or the other he’d stay neutral about it, rather than give into his jealousy over Hadrian spending time with someone else besides Wills and his Councilors or his approval or even joining Hadrian in getting to know Octavian.AAs the morning of the Hogwarts visit dawned bright and clear, Hadrian had marveled over seeing things so sharply for several minutes before physically shaking himself out of his wonder and beginning his preparations.AA quick breakfast then bathing and dressing in his formal “King” attire that he’d made all the rage: dragonhide pants in black, black tunic, and today an emerald-green dueling robe with his chain of office and rings in place, his Cuff never leaving his wrist now that he’d been betrothed to William.AHe was rather vindictively hoping that Dumbledore would just do something beyond the pale so Hadrian could sack him right then and there.AHowever another part of him, what Siri had dubbed the “Slytherin mark” from his inheritance-via-conquest, cautioned that keeping Dumbledore installed at Hogwarts also kept him busy and in plain sight.  A secretive Dumbledore in the public’s eye was infinity preferable to a hidden Dumbledore with no one watching him and all the time in the world to come up with plans to once again return to the limelight and bask in the public’s adoration.  And with installing a new co-Headmaster to keep an eye on the old manipulator, the worst of his machinations would be curtailed at least inside of the school.AMeeting his Council in the main courtyard, the only part of Skye Palace that someone could use to enter or exit the Palace under magical means even via house elf…unless you were him, he gave them all a radiant smile.AIt was time to go dethrone an old goat.A…AAlbus Dumbledore was not having a good day.AIndeed, he’d go so far as to say he hadn’t had a good day since the night of July Thirty-First.AOn that night, Harry Potter’s eleventh birthday, he hadn’t expected to feel anything at all.  Harry was still safely tucked away at the Dursleys being modeled into an appropriately blank and malleable canvass according to the squib he’d stationed there to watch him.  The child would be appropriately clueless about his heritage even after entering the wizarding world for Hogwarts at thirteen.AHe’d be at least two years behind his schoolmates but all the better.AWith the stock he came from, neither James nor Lily were anything but intelligent, it wouldn’t do to have the boy be too successful.  The Greater Good required an appropriate sacrifice at the right time to defeat Voldemort.  Not another prodigy like Tom Riddle who’d had to be dealt with.ADealing with Tom was easy enough and gave him the villain he needed to catapult himself back into the limelight after his popularity started to wane in the fifties.AIncreasing the anti-muggleborn hostilities in Slytherin was ridiculous in its ease.  A mental suggestion here, a minor veiled compulsion spell there, and a possible rival to the then-deputy Headmaster’s clear superiority was sidelined as a Dark Lord.  Granted, he never thought Tom would prove himself quite so hard to rid himself of once his uselessness had waned.  From what he could tell, the wizard’s Shade was still drifting about an Albanian forest and possessing low creatures to stay if not alive in the strictest sense of the words then at least existent.AHarry Potter was proving himself to be a much larger nuisance than Tom ever was or seems possible for a child who was supposed to have been beaten and broken, ready for saving and molding into the perfect disposable Savior.  He’d even had Molly Weasley, social climber that she is, filling her daughter’s head with dreams of being Lady Potter from the cradle.  Once Tom was banished for good and all, and Ginevra was carrying Potter’s child and heir, the blasted boy’s usefulness would be at an end and he could be permanently dealt with.  Together the grieving Widow and Potter’s beloved Mentor would have been able to take control of Harry’s Seats on the Wizengamot and the Lords Council, at last gaining Dumbledore, a commoner with an Azkaban convict for a father, a foothold among the Nobles.AThe rumored Potter fortune would have simply been icing on the cake.ABut Royalty?AWho could expect the blasted brat was Royalty?AThere’d never been even a hint that the Potters or Evanses descended from the illustrious Avalon Seven.AIf there had been Harry would never had darkened the Durlseys’ doorway.  Instead he would have been kept safe and more importantly stupid while Dumbledore positioned himself as the real Power in Avalon.  Much like that damned Wallace and Holmes bastards had done.AHow they’d found him – the Headmaster had been sure to block Wallace’s abilities to track the squalling brat – when were questioned for which Albus, for once, had no answer.ALogic would dictate that it was around the time of Sirius Black’s release from Azkaban that the child was located.ADumbledore had done what he could to block that fiasco but he’d learned of it too late.  In the end he had lost a large part of his reputation and clout – not to mention money once all the fines were files with Gringotts – in the aftermath of the debacle.AThat Wallace hadn’t even batted an eye over the trial or himself attempted to prevent it was telling.AThe only way he could have known of Black’s innocence was if he had heard Pettigrew confess, highly unlikely as the rat was still safely protected and living as a pet at the Burrow, or the Wallace Lord had unsealed James and Lily’s Wills.AWills that Albus had sealed himself so they would never open without the child being within Gringotts to do so.AAn event that had in all probability preceded or been preceded by the Wallace Lord and those Holmes menaces discovering Harry’s heritage.AA full blood heritage testing would be the only way to confirm Wallace’s claim as the boy’s guardian without going through any type of procedure or filing with the Ministry of Magic.  A happenstance of paperwork that even Albus would have wanted to avoid at all costs in their position.  Having technically kidnapped Potter from his relatives – not that anyone could prove that now.AToo late anyway, proof of wrongdoing aside.  Not now that his perfect disposable weapon and source of future wealth was King of Avalon and most likely distrusting of the Headmaster.  A state of affairs Albus could fix with judicious usage of memory charms and Legilimency suggestions.  Loyalty potions perhaps if all else fails.AHe straightened abruptly.  A serious disturbance in the wards surrounding the school grounds had pinged at his mental shields.  And a large group of people had entered through the Hogwarts gates.AHurrying with a speed that belied his age, he met his Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall in all her tartan-clad glory in the entrance hall.  Her connection to the wards wasn’t as total as his own but anyone with even the slightest magical sensitivity would have sensed the group who just came through the wards without Hogwarts hindering them in any way.  Opening the Great Hall doors with a flick of his wand, they both saw why.AStriding up the path from Hogsmeade was the full-complement of the Hogwarts Board of Governors.  With them was elderly Griselda Marshbanks, Head of Educational Testing for the Ministry of Magic along with many of her subordinates as well as her own boss: Galen Patil the Head of the MoM’s Education Department who in theory oversaw the greater scope of education in the magical United Kingdom while the Board of Governors oversaw Hogwarts.  The relationship between the two parties: Galen and the Board, wasn’t nearly so clean or cut-and-dried as that.  Also present was Eddard Ollivander, Lord Garrick Ollivander’s Heir, who was currently serving as Headmaster of the Hedwig Institute of Magic while he took a decade-long sabbatical from the Family vocation of wandmaking and chronicling wand lore.AThen the greater group parted, showing just whom they’d been clustered around either protectively or attentively.AThe King of Avalon and his Privy Council had come to Hogwarts.A…AUnbeknownst to Hadrian, Lucius and Sherringord had put their collective heads together on how best to announce the Educational Changes and Law Reforms to the public without making it seem like Hadrian was slipping into a dictatorial regime.  Hadrian was an absolute ruler but for the most part he stayed far, far away from dictating to others.  Except for Severus.  Severus he’d had to dictate to or he’d still be fighting him over removing his Mark and joining his Staff.AIt wasn’t long before the political mastermind and professional manipulator hit on a solution.AWith public approval for Hadrian and the Avalonian Kingship at an all-time high as Lucius slowly stoked the public adoration of their young handsome King to a fever pitch and Dumbledore’s having never recovered from the scandal of Sirius Black’s trial, they knew the old man would jump at any chance to publicly align his name to Hadrian’s no matter how temporarily.ATheir plan was simple: tour the castle so Hadrian could “inspect” his property while simultaneously repairing the damage done to the wards and enchantments by generation after generation of neglect.  Then once Dumbledore is reeling after learning about his probation they will lead him to the press conference on the steps of the castle where Hadrian, the Head of the Department of Education, Lucius as the Head of the Board of Governors, Amelia, and the two Headmasters of the foremost British Schools will publicly announce the changes coming into effect over the next two years.  Including new subject matter and staffing additions and reforms.AIt was being staged as a sort of roundtable event where the press got to hear first both from the brains behind the new law but also the Headmasters and the Education Department who would be ultimately held responsible for implementing the new reforms and changes to current policy.AAmelia was in large part there to show support for the changes both as the interim Minister for Magic but also as a Master Auror and Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as part of their announcement deals with several pieces of the new Law Reformations.AThe Fall Session of the Wizengamot opened the day after Hadrian’s Lordship Ball giving him plenty of time to push things like the Law Reformations through and have them in place and functioning without needing to worry about their reactions.AWell…A“Plenty of time” might be a slight exaggeration.A“Enough time” might be a better statement.  It was close but with the work they’d put in before Hadrian had even Claimed his Lordship they should be able to get what they needed taken care of without a fight through.  Should.  Maybe.  With hope and prayer to Lady Magic.ANot that there was anything the Wizengamot members could do anyway but with Britain as unstable as it was Hadrian and his Council would rather continue with the farce of being a democracy instead of shoving his Kingship down their throats.  Especially with the large mundane-born population the territory possessed.  He didn’t want some idiot trying to challenge his right to rule when he still had Dumbledore and Voldemort to deal with.  And to be honest he really couldn’t afford it at the dawn of his rule.AThey wouldn’t get anywhere with staging some sort of protest or even outright rebellion but they, the public didn’t know that.AOnly Masters of History of Magic and the Noble Families that still taught the olde ways knew how absolute a Magical King’s control over their territory was in reality.  Magic Herself Blessed Hadrian and the other monarchs as King or Emperor or Pharaoh during the Confirmation and Claiming Ceremonies.  If She didn’t approve of both them and their plans they would have been killed or rendered a squib.  That was the risk he and they all took and the bet they make by stepping into a Ritual Site upon their birthdays following their eligibility to rule.AFor Hadrian that was at age eleven.AFor other monarchs that were the next successor in a long line of kings, pharaohs, and emperors it could be eleven or a hundred and eleven.AThe common witch or wizard no doubt believed, at least in Britain, that being a King was a matter of bloodline and it partially was.  You had to be of the right lineage to take control of the Avalon Ward stones and grid or they’d swat you aside or fry you like a gnat.  But there were hundreds or even thousands of people out there who carried the blood of at least one Royal Line in their veins yet never touched the Throne.AMagic chooses who would Serve Her best, who had the Power She needs.AThat’s how one became King of Avalon or Egypt or Japan.ABlood, Power, and Service.A…AHaving met Lord Ollivander several times, both on official State business as well as seeking his opinion as to whether Hadrian should attempt to bond with a wand – Ollivander deciding unequivocally against it unless the King wished to conceal the depth and control of his Magic – Hadrian found himself pleasantly surprised by his son and Heir, Hadrian’s soon-to-be Headmaster Eddard Ollivander.  The two spent most of the walk up to the castle proper with their heads – one ebony, one salt-and-pepper sandy brown – bent together discussing what Hadrian’s goals regarding education were, both the King’s own personal education as well as for the greater education of magical Avalon as a whole.  By the time they’d shocked Dumbledore with Hadrian’s inclusion in the group, the King had found himself with a stout supporter of both his new magical reforms and his desire to seek out multiple Masteries in order to be both the best King and Mage as he could possibly be.  Though Eddard did caution him to try and narrow his focus down to perhaps two “Kingly” Masteries and two “Hadrian” Masteries.AFour Masteries were more than all but the most ardent scholars and professors ever pursued and would set an excellent example for the rest of his people in academic success without making him seem like an eternal student.AFood for thought as Hadrian was about to begin his formal education at Eddard’s school on the first of September.AAnd as Ollivander the Younger was an Heir and to one of Hadrian’s fellow Utmost Ancient and Noble Houses, Eddard was an extremely good supporter to have, politically and personally.  Eddard sat as his father’s proxy for both the Wizengamot and the Lords Council when proxies were allowed.  His Pater Garrick much preferred wands to wizards and wand lore to dry political debates.A“Headmaster Dumbledore,” Galen Patil, the Head of the Department of Education, stepped forward in greeting as previously discussed.  “As voted on and discussed by the Hogwarts Board of Governors at their last meeting,” or yesterday.  “The Department of Magical Education in conjunction with the Board and other vested parties are here to perform a surprise inspection of the state of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”A“I see,” Dumbledore stroked one hand down his mighty beard.  And indeed he did.  “And to what do I owe the presence of young Harry?”ANearly everyone present bristled as Minerva stared at her old friend in affronted shock.  That was all but a slap in the face both to common courtesy and the Throne.ADumbledore simply looked around with his “genial grandfather” mask as if perplexed why all of a sudden he was subject to glares that would make a lesser man wet himself.AHadrian was one of the only people present not glaring at him, internally rolling his eyes at the old manipulator’s opening salvo.  The other was Eddard Ollivander who like Hadrian, knew Albus well enough and was wary enough, to see past the obvious ploy to knock the group off their game.  If they weren’t under scrutiny as the others watched for a signal on how to handle the slight, the two of them would trade commiserating looks.A“Correct Us if We are wrong.”  The Royal Treatment it was, Hadrian decided.  No one could take him being completely formal and make a national incident out of it.  Lady Maggie had drummed it into his head over the years, probably attempting to counteract Sirius’s bad influence on his manners: when in doubt be polite.  No one ever made the front page of the Prophet for being proper and civil.  “However We do not believe We have ever been introduced to you Headmaster.”A“Nonsense, Harry.”  Dumbledore waved off the genial correction with his affected bonhomie.  “I’ve known you since you were a baby.”AA look flicked towards Sherrinford was all it took.A“Headmaster,” the Lord High Chancellor corrected him sternly.  “Matters of your unbecoming familiarity with His Grace aside, you have never been introduced to the King of Avalon.  Protocol dictates that you wait for an introduction and refer to His Grace as His Grace the King of Avalon until instructed otherwise.”  The: I should not have to tell you this hung in the air like a noxious cloud, poisoning even Dumbledore’s sickeningly-sweet manner.A“Now now, Sherrinford.”  The old man continued relentlessly, ignoring the desperate attempts by his Deputy to derail him before he got them both sacked.  “You know I pride myself on being on good terms with all my students.  Even ones who have yet to cross the threshold of Hogwarts.  Surely His Grace doesn’t insist on special treatment?”ABefore someone anyone could correct him both for his assumption and for failing to greet an Most Ancient and Noble Lord properly, the membership of the Privy Council being kept mostly a secret still at this point, Hadrian stepped in once again and put a halt to the whole debate.A“Not special, Headmaster.”  Hadrian gave a regal nod then arched a sardonic brow.  “But the same simple courtesy that should be accorded to anyone in a structured, modern, society.  We insist on nothing but what is availed everyone in Avalon: social courtesy.  After all,” Hadrian’s eyes were cold as ice.  “We have not brought up the many offenses you have perpetrated against Our Person by committing the most heinous crimes of kidnapping and attempted Line Theft by leaving Us with abusive and improper guardians for an Heir to a Most Ancient and Noble House.  However if you Headmaster would prefer to dispense with courtesy, We would be most amenable to discussing them now.”AWith every witch and wizard there as witnesses.AAlbus nearly wheezed in shock.  Whoever had informed Harry of the events following his parents’ deaths had done an excellent job.  He must have some sort of relationship with Sirius and Remus after all.  There had been no rumors regarding what Sirius Black was up to other than maintaining the Black Estate and Remus had been out of communication with the old crowd since taking up a private tutoring position just before Sirius’s release from Azkaban.  As far as anyone know the two hadn’t even reconnected following the events of Halloween Nineteen Eighty-One.A“There will be no need for that, Your Grace.”  The Headmaster caved at once, ashen-faced at having his misdeeds flaunted before some of the biggest gossips in Britain (Griselda Marshbanks, Lucius Malfoy, etc.)  “Now I believe Head of Education Patil mentioned an inspection?”A…AAs the elder wizard led part of the contingent up to the Astronomy Tower in a blatant attempt to distract them from their purpose, a splinter group broke off and made for the seventh floor.A“Are you sure it really exists, lad?”  McG had decided to accompany his charge down to Hogwarts, Remus staying behind to run the guards left in Avalon through a few training exercises with help from his Master-Auror mate.  Plus it let him see his mum without having to request time off.A“All the texts recovered in the Vaults were clear,” Hadrian answered absently as he led McG along with one of the other guards and his shadow Russell towards a very familiar gargoyle.  “There were even copies of the blueprints in both the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw Vaults.  The Hogwarts Ward Room in right under what is now the Headmaster’s office.”AIn theory all he should have to do was put a drop of blood on the gargoyle’s tongue to activate the hidden door that led to the chamber.  Before it was turned into an office it was the private chambers of Godric Gryffindor.  And as the ruined Gryffindor castle stones were used to build Hogwarts on Gryffindor land, he was elected best to keep the wards up and running.AReaching the gargoyle he took out a simple dagger Siri had given him when he expressed an interest learning to fight like the animagus.AOne of the things that made Sirius Black so deadly and effective when he was an Auror was that he didn’t rely solely on magic like many do.  Lily had convinced both Sirius and her husband James that knowing how to fight without their wands or magic would both make them more effective with them and allow them not to have to flee if they were caught without them or were unable to use magic for some reason.  James according to Siri and Remy’s stories preferred brawling to edged weapons.  He didn’t have Hadrian’s discipline making swordwork and fencing a chore instead of a treat.  Siri on the other hand for all that he had a bad reputation for being reckless and undisciplined took extremely well to blades of all sorts, though his favorite was either a dagger in his off-hand while wielding a wand or fighting with daggers in both hands.AHadrian had seen Siri’s effectiveness when he finally gave in a faced Hadrian’s fencing and sword instructor Gawain one-on-one sword versus daggers.AAs long as Gawain could keep him from getting too close he did very well.ABut as soon as Sirius saw an opening he had Gawain on the ground with daggers at throat and belly.AThe young wizard wasn’t anywhere near as effective as Siri and so far preferred having a one-handed or a bastard sword in his main hand with a dagger for his off-hand.  That wasn’t always possible anymore as Ancuru was almost a broadsword or greatsword.  For someone who wasn’t fully grown yet he needed both hands to handle the length.  So he stuck to Siri’s style of double-daggers at the moment when working with short blades.ANicking his finger on the blade, he squeezed several drops of blood out and onto the gargoyle’s tongue, healing the small wound with a bit of his wandless, wordless magic.AHadrian had barely put the dagger safely away when the gargoyle’s eyes flashed red and gold – Gryffindor colors – and the very stones beneath his feet sank into the floor.  McG grabbed onto him, shielding and stabilizing them as the other guard did the same.  They’d been lowered a full ten feet down and then the stone moved horizontally into an opening in the castle wall.  The archaic elevator stopped before an ornately carved grey wall that had the sigils of the four Founders arrayed in mosaic tile around a larger Hogwarts crest.AThe King simply looked up at McG and arched a brow in a clear “I told you so,” look.AMcG rolled his eyes and scoffed, not impressed with the wordless gloating.A“Now what?”  The Scotsman asked.AHadrian pointed to the one piece of the wall section that didn’t quite fit: an inlaid dragon done in gleaming grey hematite.AHe grinned.  “The motto is part pseudo-sage advice and part instruction.  Never tickled a sleeping dragon.”  Reaching over he did just that at a smooth spot on the ridged bas-relief scales.AThe little dragon gave a yawn and a silent roar then the entire wall rotated around the Hogwarts crest before melting into the surrounded stonework revealing the Hogwarts ward room exactly where Hadrian had insisted it was: directly under the Headmaster’s office.AHogwarts’ new Lord took one look at the seven ward stones and grimaced.  They’d truly suffered for lack of being cleansed and renewed on schedule.  He didn’t know when the secret had been lost, which Headmaster failed to inform their successor, but the wards and therefor the castle and school had paid dearly for it.  What should be seven sparkling stones filled with life and power were seven dingy-grey and barely functioning rocks.AHow students weren’t being endangered right-and-left by the lacking wards and the professors weren’t being constantly drained to support them he’d never know.APure will on the part of the castle most likely.AHe’d felt her since stepping on the grounds.  She was weak and growing weaker but his very presence was already helping to replenish her.  Many had asserted Hogwarts was alive.  And they were partly right.  It was more along the lines of gaining sentience from all the magic seeping into the stones before and after they were used for the castle as well as the enchantments placed on the castle at its Founding.AHadrian sighed and cracked his neck.  “Time to get to work.”AMoving first to the main stone in the center of the six-point star configuration the Founders had used, lines of inlaid gemstones and marble making up the actual lines of the star, Hadrian took his dagger out and once more laid open his hand.  At least the Hogwarts wards wouldn’t leave him with a scar as Avalon’s did to Mark their King.  Placing his palm wound down on the flat top of the cylindrical stone he felt the wards latch onto the power in his blood and…well…feast for lack of another word.AAs the ward stone “fed” off of his blood and power he and his guards watched as pulses of raw power coursed from the center stone and along the lines of the star to the secondary ward stones.AIt certainly was a lot more efficient than going from stone-to-stone like he did to charge the Avalon wards but not as powerful.  With Avalon they needed the extra power from direct contact with his blood.  Hogwarts was a ward structure on a much smaller scale and could sacrifice power for efficiency.AWorked for him, the less amount of times he has to slice into his own veins the better.AThe longer the stone was in contact with his blood and drew on his power the cleaner all the stones became, Hadrian both feeling and seeing the wards strengthen around him.  Before long, he and the others could see the types of stones the founders had used to anchor the ward structure.  The stone under his hand was a raw diamond, as many central stones were for their ability to supplement and boost the power of other stones.  A ruby cut into a pyramid stood over a foot tall from tip to base and was at least four inches wide at the bottom, Gryffindor made the ruby their House Stone for it being arguably the most powerful of gems with the ability to engender contentment and peace as well as cleansing impurities.  In a ward structure it cleansed the warded area from wards, spells, enchantments, and curses not original or wound into the ward structure by whoever had control of the grid.AOne surprise was the turquoise bearing the Ravenclaw crest.  A square tower as large as the ruby pyramid beside it but around six inches wide, it replaced what would have been a blue diamond in the configuration.  A wise move from what Hadrian knew of gem lore as another diamond would have merely provided more power instead of the divine help and protection in battle turquoise was valued for.  Hufflepuff’s onyx orb at a mere four inches in circumference was petite and restrained among the larger stones but made up for its small size in its ability to guard against negative thoughts and added protection to the wards.  That stone along with several of the spells and enchantments laid into the very foundation of the castle helped create the welcoming sensation many students felt at the school.AAlongside its fellows sat a humble carnelian that was perhaps the most vital of all the stones with its sensitivity to and natural protection against evil and misfortune while its neighbors of peridot warned of impending danger and dark tourmaline purified strange wards and spells from the castle.AIt was as carefully selected a set of ward stones as the ones which made up and anchored Avalon’s wards.AThough on smaller scale.AHadrian sucked in a breath as the diamond grew uncomfortably hot then made a draining pull on his magic before releasing him.  Gasping he cradled his hand to his chest though managed to stay on his feet.  Taking several deep in-and-out breaths he slipped into a meditative trace for several moments, regaining his equilibrium as his magic rushed to replenish itself.ALooking around he noted that the chamber was sparkling and crackling with life as it cycled his magic through the wards, finally able once again to self-repair and recover from the effects of being neglected for far too long.AReaching out he felt the magic of the wards with his own innate magic.  Mere minutes after the central stone had finished siphoning his power from him and already the difference was night-and-day.  Several enchantments that had the sticky-sweet magical residue of the Headmaster had been washed away.  Probing with a delicate touch he discovered that they were mainly purposed to causing discord between the Houses, especially Slytherin and Gryffindor while engendering loyalty and confidence in the Headmaster.AHadrian smirked to himself.AIf the old man was counting on those to help him with the still on-going inspection he was in for a rude awakening.AThere were several others he made note of strictly due to their nature more than who cast them – though the curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position was rather interesting in an insidious way.  It had the same “flavor” as the Dark Marks he’d removed from Lucius and Severus, letting him know just who had come up with that particular curse.  He found another with Riddle’s aura keeping people away from and blinded to something he hid in the Room of Requirement which was of particular concern.ASomething to investigate after he’d returned to the larger party.ALucius and Sherrinford couldn’t keep Dumbledore and the Board spinning in circles forever – though it would be entertaining to watch them try.AThere were dozens and dozens of spells and enchantments all meant to cause harm in one way or another – including the one responsible for the moving staircases.  Which if he was reading the cast right was meant to make the unwary fall either to injury or death.  Hardly the benign “quirk of the castle” the Headmaster and others before him had passed it off as.ASummoning a piece of parchment and a never-out quill, Hadrian quickly wrote a note detailing an even more familiar magical signature – that of Remus and Sirius with what had to be his father’s touch.  It was the tie into the castle wards that allowed their “Marauders Map” to function.  He had to allow the wards to do their job and remove it but now that he knew how the tie worked he could ask about how they made the map itself before retracing their steps.AAfter all, why would he let someone else benefit from their work when he had no idea of who had the Map?AYes, it could still be sitting on a dusty shelf filled with other contraband in Filch’s office but it could just as easily be in the hands of Death Eaters.AThe risk when he could disable the missing Map or even Maps and make his own when he came back for schooling wasn’t worth the risk of the wrong people finding the Map.AVanishing the parchment and quill to his private study in the King’s Tower he nodded to McG and led them from the ward room.  Hogwarts would be able to take care of herself and her charges without interference now until he returned for school and charged the ward stones once more.  Though he would have to come back and meet with the wizard he’d selected for co-Headmaster and share control of the wards with him.  Over his dead body he’d entrust them to Dumbledore.ASlipping back in among the Privy Council, Hadrian gave Lucius a discrete signal of his return, slightly warming his Mark over the wizard’s heart.ASmoothly the talented manipulator and political force interjected into the discussion about new brooms for the flying classes and quidditch teams.A“Fascinating Headmaster,” the icy-blonde drawled.  “However discussing the state of the school brooms, something which there should be plenty of funding for without asking for an increased budget or donations, is not the reason why we’ve come.  Nor is the riveting talk regarding Filch’s upkeep of the castle, lacking as it is, or that of Groundskeeper Hagrid’s pumpkins health.  We have come to see the deplorable state which the castle has fallen under your Headmastership and decide our next move regarding the new education reforms accordingly.”A“Castles take funds to maintain, gentlemen and ladies.”  Dumbledore gently chided the Board like they were arrant schoolchildren.  “Funds which the Hogwarts budget does not have to spare.”A“Indeed?”  Gawain asked mildly.  “How so?  As I or anyone who is paying tuition for their children to attend this fine establishment, the Hogwarts budget should be a beacon of good health.”AThere were grumblings from several other parents of school-aged children who were attending Hogwarts, not least among them McG who had two daughters in Gryffindor and a son in Hufflepuff from his two failed marriage.  Hit Wizards do not make good husbands.  Though he did try to be a good father to his children, albeit from a distance.AAfter his own disasters in matrimony he understood completely why the most traditional families which included the King insisted on bonding rather than simple marriage.AMarriages could be broken, bondings were for life.ASometimes beyond.A“Teacher salaries, staff salaries, food budget, scholarships and grants,” Dumbledore waved a hand.  “And many other drains on the school accounts.”A“Really?”  Gawain drawled, snapping his fingers and summoning a thick, thick file and flipping it open.  “According to the audit Gringotts initially began in June of Nineteen Eighty-Five at the request of the then Confirmed Lord Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Hufflepuff, King-Apparent of Avalon,” or Hadrian depending on who hoity-toity one was being.  “No expenditures other than staff salaries and minor withdrawals from the scholarship fund have been made for the last six years.  And the withdrawals from the scholarship fund were only of the most minor nature required to keep the fund active instead of defunct and returning the funds contained therein to the donating parties.”AGawain looked up from the file before snapping it shut.A“Don’t take us for fools, Headmaster.”  Sherrinford warned.  “We’ve audited the funds of the school extensively and have undertaken a report regarding the OWL and NEWT scores for the last century.”A“Hogwarts if flush, Headmaster.”  Lucius drawled bluntly.  “Something I as the Head of the Board of Governors found fascinating when Lord Wallace turned over the results of both the audit and the scores report to me earlier in the summer.”A“Especially,” Amelia was also a member of the Board as the Lady of House Bones.  “As lack of funding has been the main reasoning behind falling scores, inability to retain teachers, and cutting classes on offer for as long as I can remember.”A“Or I can remember.”  The venerable – and scary – Dowager Longbottom added spitefully.AShe still blamed that goat-loving bastard for the condition of her son and his wife.  Had they not joined up with his merry band of sycophants, they might still be capable of leading House Longbottom and raising their Heir.  She was old, tired, and heartbroken.  Not the best person to entrust Neville to, though since befriending the now-King he’d seemed to blossom.AGalen Patil took the conversation in hand, looking up from the reports Gawain Wallace had handed him once he’d finished consulting them to confront Dumbledore.A“If funding isn’t the problem Dumbledore,” Patil’s tone was dangerous, his dark eyes glinting.  “What is?  Why does Hogwarts have deplorable OWL and NEWT scores compared to other schools of its stature, hells.”  He cursed thinking of the other school in Britain.  “To that of the public and subsidized schools in our own country.”AAlbus was stymied.  The audit had hit him out of nowhere and the truth wasn’t an option.  Telling the Board, King, and Minister of Magic interim or not that you were planning on emptying the accounts right before retiring when there would be no one to question his sudden upgrade in lifestyle wasn’t a sound plan for retaining his job.AHis silence was damning but not as much as speaking would have been.A“Then there is no choice.”  Lucius held back his smirk, going with his stoic Slytherin mask instead.  “But to implement a period of probation on you Headmaster.  A co-Headmaster has already been retained and will be here within a week.  He will oversee the proper utilization of the Hogwarts funds and accounts and ensure that the new educational reforms are carried out.  This is your only warning Headmaster.”  Lucius gave him a fierce look.  “If you attempt to hinder the new co-Headmaster in any way you will be turned off without hesitation.”A“Under whose authority are you making this decision?”  Dumbledore blustered.  “Educational Reforms?  What madness is this?”A“Our Authority.”  Hadrian said softly.  “And Our Reforms.  As to the madness…the only one acting in a rash or mad manner here is yourself, Headmaster.”ADumbledore fumed silently.ASeeing that her boss…er…co-boss wasn’t going to further engage the Board and their guests, Minerva took the reins.A“What Reforms should I be concerned with?”A“Changes in staffing and subjects taught, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall.”  Galen accepted a file from an aide and passed it to the stern witch.  “With the deregulation of many magics, they can once again be taught at this venerable school and staff have been retained to teach them.  In addition several staff members are to be let go and replaced.  There have also been junior professors hired or heads of departments whose job it will be to either oversee the various subject departments as well as administer Apprenticeships as should be already occurring or to teach the younger years to lighten the loads on the department heads.”AMinerva flipped through the file.A“I’ve been replaced?”  She look was white-faced and panicked.  “Have I erred in some way?”A“It’s not a punishment Professor.”  Hadrian smiled at her warmly.  “It’s a promotion.  From now on as Deputy Headmistress you will serve as a counselor and bridge between the students as staff in addition to your regular duties.  We believe and Our advisors concur that asking one person to teach seven years’ worth of Transfiguration students, be an effective Head of House, and Deputy Headmistress was asking too much.  Should you still desire to teach, you will be allowed to have up to three apprenticeships active at a time.  Granted that is half the number of apprentices as the Department Heads but a good number for a busy witch such as yourself.”AThe stern professor nearly beamed once the staffing change was explained to her.  Hadrian continued as she returned to perusing the file.A“OWL students will be taught by qualified apprentices or junior professors while NEWTS are taught by junior professors or department heads.  Only department heads will be allowed to take on sixth and seventh year apprenticeships.  Defense Against the Dark Arts or the Dark Arts and their Defense has been removed entirely.”AMinerva gasped as she realized what she was looking at.A“Dark Arts?!”  She whipped her head to the still-silent Dumbledore.  “Albus they want us to teach the Dark Arts!”A“Not just the Dark Arts,” Hadrian shrugged nonchalantly at some of the expressions he was receiving.  “Magic has largely been deregulated in magical Britain following many of the new Law Reforms.  So-called “Dark Magic” is no longer illegal and as a result Hogwarts is required to teach it.  Whether you like it or not.  The Hogwarts Curriculum will include the following subjects by September First, staff have already been retained: Charms, Potions, Transfiguration, Herbology, Astronomy, Defense replacing DADA, History of Magic, and Wizarding Culture.  OWLs students will have the following electives: Dueling, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Ancient Runes, Magical Law, Mundane Studies replacing Muggle Studies, and Dark Arts.”AHadrian almost smiled as Dumbledore turned puce.A“NEWT level students can choose from Dueling, Arithmancy, Finance, Ancient Runes, Magical Law, Ritual Magic, Warding, the Dark Arts, Healing, Care of Magical Creatures, Alchemy, and Spell Weaving.  Professors will also each be required to host or captain a club or activity.”A“With that many new subjects its no wonder an audit was ordered.”  Minerva commented dazedly.ALucius leaned forward and whispered in Hadrian’s ear for several moments.  A wicked grin flashed across his face for a split second before he turned and moved towards the Great Hall doors.  The press had arrived.A…A“You enjoyed that entirely too much.”  Wills laughed after Hadrian finished his retelling of his adventure to Hogwarts.A“Not as much as when the old man had to choke on his bile and pretend to support the new reforms for the press.”  Hadrian studied the wizarding chess board before ordering his Queen’s knight to take Wills’ King’s bishop.  “Or when he realized he no longer was connected to the Hogwarts wards.”A“Sometimes I think you just like messing with peoples’ heads.”  Wills shook his own head in mock sadness, laughing when Hadrian gave him a little shove.A“Not people,” Hadrian corrected.  “Mainly just Dumbledore.  He tried to control my life from the moment I was orphaned.  I’m merely returning the favor.”A“As long as you never sink to his level, I’m okay with it.”  Wills shrugged, giving his betrothed a smile then wrinkled his nose as he thought of something.  “Or somehow contract the man’s atrocious fashion sense.  Has age blinded him or is he just senile?”AThe two bonded-betrotheds laughed, whiling away the evening with a roaring fire and another game of chess as Hadrian’s Queen viciously beheaded Wills’ King.A ",The Avalon Seven,108617

StairAA“Welcome to the Hedwig Institute of Magic.”  Eddard stood at the podium in the front of the room after all the new students had settled down after being introduced to Hadrian.  “As you have already heard, I am the Headmaster, Professor and Master Wand Maker Eddard Ollivander.  I am also the main Professor of the “A” Week group of students.  All of the students in this room, no matter what group you are a part of, will attend the five main lecture classes together in this very room: History of Magic, Magical Theory, and the Three Magics: Dark, Light, and Grey.  Every student will also meet with their main Professor and assigned Mentor following their individual placement testing, either myself, Professor Elaine Diggory for “B” Week students, or Professor Dugal Smythe-Smith for “C” Weeks students.”AHadrian leaned over and whispered to Wills: “That’s Conan’s mum, he’ll be in our week.”AEach of the named Professors, who outside of H.I. were a Lady of an Aged and Noble House and a mundane-born wizard respectively, stood from their seats in the row behind the Headmaster.A“We have individual placement testing here at Hedwig Institute for a simple reason: at Hedwig only the bindings you place on yourself determine what you can achieve.  To that end while many of the classes will have a standard-lecture format, there will also be room for individual talents and interests to blossom.  Or on the other hand if there is a form of study you struggle with, you will receive the help you need from your professors to be prepared for Hogwarts in two years’ time.  Your meetings with your main group Professors serve a simple purpose: to discover what you might have in mind for a career or vocation following your basic education.”AHere Eddard smirked sardonically down at the first row of students where the King of Avalon was flanked by his betrothed and his friend Heir Longbottom.A“If what you desire is to be a great King, we will do what we can to prepare you for that path.”  Now he looked around at the other students who were drinking in the welcome speech with wide-eyes.  “If you want to do nothing more than live off your inheritance, I will remind you that letting your parents tutor you until you’re ready to skim through the OWLs is much less a drain on your future gold than this Institute.  However if you yearn to make your money work for you, we will prepare you for a Mastery in Finance.  If Spell Weaving is your secret goal, we shall give you the foundation you will need.  Be honest with your Professors, that they might help you further along your chosen path.  Now.”  He clapped his hands together twice and the comfortable stadium seating transfigured into student desks.  “Let the testing begin!”A…ALunch found twenty-seven new H.I. students slumped over their bowls of rich beef or vegetarian stew in the finely-appointed dining room.  Unlike Hogwarts, H.I. served a strict lunch and tea of nutritious and balanced meals rather than simply allowing the food to be served family-style, each chose a place at a table and then selected something from each category.  On this first day of school they could choose between a beef or vegetarian stew, various vegetable sticks with a dipping sauce or a salad, and a selection of fresh fruits or a mixed fruit cocktail for something sweet.AUnless it was a feast day or celebration, pure sweets were rarely served at H.I. along with the overly-sugary pumpkin juice, with water, milk, or no-sugar-added juices being preferred though tea was an option.AHadrian and Wills were the first to rouse, dipping spoons into their hearty stew and picking at the veggie and fruit selections each had ordered.ANeville turned his head and gave the two a mild glare from his still bent-over position.A“How can you recover so quick?”  He complained mildly, just short of a whine.  “I feel like my brain’s been sucked out and blended then squeezed back in.”AHis friend laughed and patted him on the back consolingly.A“I have half-a-dozen tutors, remember?”  Hadrian chuckled, even if most of them are more like parents than teachers.  “This is not the first time I’ve started my day with a gauntlet of tests.”A“What’s your excuse?”  Draco haughtily demanded of William from his position on Neville’s other side.  He’d quickly blended into the forming group, which had been joined by one of his own friends who was in the “C” week, Blaise Zabini.AH.I. capped study groups at five students and neither Draco nor Blaise were going to miss out on getting to know the King of Avalon better.AIt helped that Hadrian had met Blaise a couple times before at the Wallace Estate, the boy being friends with the older Rhys who started Hogwarts this same day.ARhys’ brother David was already seventeen and was one of the first students to take advantage of the new apprenticeships offered at Hogwarts with Hadrian’s education reform, being chosen for a duel apprenticeship with the new Defense Head Elizabeth Shacklebolt and the Dark Arts Head Tiberian Nott.AThe new Lord Prewett was also undertaking an apprenticeship at Hogwarts as well as Hadrian’s cousin Dora, though Dora was after becoming a Master Auror like Sirius while her friend Charlie was seeking a Mastery in Care of Magical Creatures.AFor a school that averages between fifty and a hundred students per year not counting the two apprenticeship years, Hogwarts had previously been massively understaffed.  Now with the new appointments and hires, there were around forty staff, making them outnumbered six-to-one instead of forty to a hundred-to-one.A“Andromeda Black-Tonks is my tutor.”  Wills said simply, the other boys giving an understanding “ahh.”  Except for Hadrian who already knew and felt his pain.  Andy was nobody’s idea of a pushover.ADraco blinked.A“That’s my aunt.”  He said slowly.  “I think.  I’ve never met either of them…well…”A“We get it.”  Hadrian jumped in before his new friend became completely discomfited by the subject.  He wasn’t going to make Draco try and explain to Wills that he’d never met Andy because his parents are bigots and that he’d never met Bellatrix because she was crazier than a bedbug and locked away in Azkaban.AThat wasn’t what friends did.A“Grandpapa Black reinstated Andy to the Black line before he passed.”  Hadrian filled in a couple of the gaps for their rapt audience.  “With meeting us maybe you’ll be able to meet your aunt sometime.”  He offered, calmly spooning up more stew as the other boys went back to eating.A“Perhaps.”  Draco answered noncommittally.  The only way that might happen was if his parents had no idea who he was meeting.  Though it might not be hard to get away with since they’d both been very busy ever since his father started on the Privy Council and they moved to Avalon City.A“How have you been, Hadrian?”  Blaise interjected smoothly to derail the topic.  “I haven’t seen you since last summer.”A“Busy.”  Hadrian laughed lightly.  “Very busy.”A“And Rhys?  He’s been pretty vague since your birthday.”  Blaise didn’t know what was going on there but figured Hadrian might since he was one of their friend’s closest companions.A“I don’t know.”  Hadrian frowned for a second, studying the piece of pineapple he’d just speared.  “The transition to Avalon seemed to go well but Rhys has been doing a fine imitation of a hermit ever since and David wasn’t talking before they both left for Hogwarts.”A“Hmm.”  Blaise nodded in understanding, humming around his mouthful of ratatouille.  He swallowed before responding.  “He does that sometimes.  More now since Lady Wallace…”  He trailed off, cautious of their surroundings.AHadrian just shrugged, shooting the confused Wills a wordless glance promising an explanation later.A“So Malfoy.”  Neville decided to speak up before the conversation could get any worse.  “How are you liking living in Avalon?  Hadrian gifted your family with use of the Basilisk’s Den while Lord Malfoy is serving on the Council, right?”A“That’s right.”  Hadrian paused in his whispering into Wills’s ear to confirm.  They didn’t have long before the meet-and-greet with their professors as well as the counseling sessions with their main professor began and he wanted to fill in Wills on the underlying stories in person.  His bonded was a little at-sea since everyone else was in some way connected or acquainted for the most part.AHadrian knew Neville from his play/social group.  Blaise knew Draco from the same sort of group besides his mother “The Black Widow” being great friends with Narcissa Malfoy nee Black.  Neville had met Blaise before at Rhys’s home as had Hadrian while Hadrian and Neville knew of Draco though they hadn’t met.AThe only person Wills had at the moment was his Rian until he made some new friends.AThankfully he wasn’t shy.A“Avalon is beautiful.”  Draco lit up at the thought of his new home.  “And the Basilisk’s Den is just brilliant.  It has all kinds of secret passages and hidden alcoves and such.  Very, very interesting.”A“Well.”  Neville observed cannily.  “It is the official Slytherin Residence in Avalon proper and Malfoys are considered the consummate Slytherins as far as Hogwarts Sorting goes.  Not surprised the Den your kind of place.  The Longbottom Estate is grand as well.  Much fancier than the Grange, though.”  The normally quiet boy cocked his head to one side lightly.A“It is in Avalon.”  Wills turned his head and gave the others a smile, caught up on the underlying friendships at play thanks to Hadrian’s coaching.  “Most things seem to run grander there.”A“Here here.”  Hadrian raised his cup of tea in a mock-toast the others laughing and following suit.A…AHadrian was the fourth student from his week to have his advisory meeting.AAs with many other years, the “A” week or Heir class at Hedwig was quite small.  Hadrian’s year especially as it wasn’t until about a year and a half after his birth – with Voldemort safely banished for the moment – that Wizarding Britain felt at ease with having children once more.  It was mostly the Nobles who wouldn’t risk their lines dying if they did – like his own father – or mundanes who had children during the height of Riddle’s reign of terror.AThe Heir week in his year was smaller than most and would’ve been smaller still if not for Wills.  Altogether there was Susan, Heiress Bones presumptive until and unless her Lady Aunt had children; her best friend Hannah, Heiress Abbott; Conan, Heir Diggory; Hadrian as Lord Emrys among others; Neville, Heir Longbottom; Draco, Heir Malfoy; and of course Hadrian’s bonded William, Lord Nimue.  Seven Heirs or in Wills’ case Lords, an auspicious number.A It was rare that an Heir would arrive at either H.I. or Hogwarts as a vested and Claimed Lord.  In fact it only happened when for whatever reason the Ritual of Blood Inheritance was utilized.  Most often, though it varied greatly depending on the rituals and traditions of the Houses, orphan Heirs and Heiresses became Lords and Ladies at the standard Wizarding majority age of seventeen when they’ve come fully into their powers, with a Regent such as the Dowager Longbottom in charge of their estates and political seats until then.AThough generally by age eleven it was known who would be an Heir and they will have been Confirmed as such.AExceptions are always viable however, such as when the late Lord Septimus Weasley overlooked all of his own children and selected instead one of his grandsons to be his Heir.A“Ah Mr. Emrys-Pendragon.”  Eddard smiled at his King, keeping to the proper formality of the occasion rather than call him Hadrian as he had permission from the Lord of Avalon to do so.  “Please sit.”AHeadmaster Ollivander waved to the wing-back chair across from him.  The interviews were in his private “Professor” office instead of his public “Headmaster” one.  It was rare that he took over a group of students as he has with Hadrian’s week however it has happened in the past.  Eleven and twelve year olds tended to be much more comfortable in his simple office with a fireplace and comfy chairs than in the somewhat over-the-top spectacle he used for meetings with prospective parents, politicians, and donors.A“Headmaster,” Hadrian nodded regally with a quirk of his lips as he sat with his innate grace in the large cream chair.A“Now to begin.”  Eddard snapped his fingers and a rolled up parchment floated over and unrolled at the Headmaster’s side, a Never-Out quill hovering over what looked to Hadrian’s eyes to be a simple blank form.  “I don’t believe we need to cover your career goals, do we?”AHadrian chuckled, shaking his head as the quill filled in his rather long formal name at the top of the form.  It quickly added his age, date of birth, and other standard information before moving to the next section and filling in: Career - Ruling King of the Avalonian Empire.A“Moving along,” Eddard glanced at the results from the placement testing that were in a bound ream of parchment on the low table between them.  “You placed extremely well.  Some of the highest grades I’ve ever seen as far as your theory tests go and you’re very, very high in the practical application percentiles.”  Top of his year – so far – though Eddard didn’t think that was anything the King wasn’t already aware of.  “Though I would expect nothing less from your previous educators.”AThe quill scratched along under Hadrian’s watchful gaze filling in “O” or Outstanding in each of the boxes for the testing results.  In several spots there was even an O with an asterisk mark beside it, signifying he’d either gotten the highest grade of his year or he’d broken a record, he wasn’t quite sure.  Something to look up later.A“Honestly, Mr. Emrys-Pendragon.”  Eddard set the testing results aside, still somewhat boggled over the results from their power-monitoring crystals that helped them discover who would need extra exercises to either expand their core or control the excess power they already have.  “If it wasn’t completely out-of-the-question I would send you straight to Hogwarts.  However,” they shared a knowing glance.  “For other reasons that action is quite unacceptable.  Therefore except for the standard lecture classes your studies will be entirely self-paced and you will be allowed to work ahead in the lecture classes as well though you must still attend them with your peers.  I’ve no intention of holding a certified prodigy back – or attempting to anyway.”  He finished dryly, knowing full-well the futility of such an action.ADespite what some would assume, with H.I.’s reputation for excellence the new King of Avalon was far from the first prodigy Eddard had mentored and he doubted Hadrian would be the last to pass through these halls.AAnd much to his surprise, Hadrian wasn’t even the only one in his group let alone his year.AFrom what his deputy had told him of the testing, they’d identified a possible prodigy in Herbology as well as more than one student with genius-level intelligence and knowledge though they were still unsure if they were actual prodigies or not.AOne prodigy in a year wasn’t unheard-of though neither was it common.  For there to be two for sure with another handful of students with the potential though lacking somewhat in drive…he found his earlier musings quite correct.  This would be an auspicious year of students indeed.A“That will suit me well.”  Hadrian agreed with a nod.  He still had his studies with his former guardians as well as the business of the Empire to cope with as well.  There was no reason to waste his time at H.I. if at all possible.  Whether Hogwarts would be as accommodating was yet to be seen.A“Now as far as your future education is concerned.”  Eddard waved a hand in an encompassing motion.  “Have you given any thought to our previous conversation?”A“I have.”A“And what have you decided?”AHadrian gave a half-smile.  “That you were right.  While it would be acceptable for a King to have a plethora of Masteries, it isn’t necessarily advisable.”A“Quite so, unfortunately.”  Eddard grimaced in empathy.  So much potential in this young man.  If an average Noble child or even Heir had been given such gifts they would have been able to devote themselves entirely to research and pioneering new magical discoveries.  As it was, one of the greatest magical talents he’d ever even heard of was a King.  “In other years, more stable and less contentious years, a King of Avalon could have been an eternal student and researcher, leaving matters of State and Security to his Council.  You do not have that luxury, Hadrian.  As much as it pains me as a guide of greater minds to admit.”AHis companion gave a small shrug.  “I was raised to this, Eddard.”  Hadrian’s face and affect was utterly calm and accepting.  “I can always tinker with Spell Weaving and Experimental Charms and other things of that manner when the Empire has settled down.  After all,” he smirked.  “There’s nothing stopping the Throne from employing Masters – even if only to teach and tutor the King in their vocations.”AEddard was pleased to see the young man wasn’t bitter over the strictures of his Office the way another might be.AProdigies have never in his experience taken a restriction on their chosen vocations so well as this eleven year old boy-King.A“Well,” Eddard waved off the depressing subject, getting back to the matter at hand.  “Have you made a decision about your education path as far as Hogwarts and your initial Masteries go.  I did caution you to pare it down to four, did I not?”A“You did.”  Hadrian smiled gratefully.  “And I studied the international qualifications and prerequisites for the Masteries I want to pursue both initially and possibly in the future.  I know Hogwarts will be stuffed to the gills with classes for me to take everything but I have a plan and I believe I can follow it.”AThe quill hovered almost anxiously over the box marked: Ordinary Wizarding Level Goals.A“You’re keeping me rapt with nerves, Hadrian.”  Ollivander rolled his eyes.  “Out with it, young man.”A“Fifteen OWLs.”  Hadrian worried his lip lightly as he peeked up at his current Professor and Headmaster with mild worry.  “Ancient Runes, Astronomy, Arithmancy, CoMC, Charms, Dark Arts, Defense, Dueling, Herbology, History of Magic, Mundane Studies, Potions, Transfiguration, Magical Law, and Divination.  I know I’ll be able to self-study Astronomy and Divination.  That makes thirteen classes I’ll need to take over the three years of OWL study before I have to take the tests.”A“It’s an aggressive plan, Hadrian.”  Ollivander frowned as he worked it out.  “You’ll have to be disciplined beyond measure and free from most distractions to accomplish it.”A“Most of the early work in stabilizing the Empire will be done by the time I enter Hogwarts.”  Hadrian shrugged.  “Only emergencies and emergent issues will need my personal attention.  I feel I’ve chosen my Council well and they’ll be capable of handling most issues by the time I’ll need to be at Hogwarts nine months of the year.”A“It’s a good thing we’ve already discussed you being self-paced.”  Eddard grimaced, frowning.  “I wouldn’t like to think of you taking this on without knowing how to self-study and self-regulate yourself when it comes to your education – a weakness tutored students sometimes face.”A“I should be ready.”  Hadrian stated confidently.  “Besides I’m only going for that many OWLs to silence my detractors.”AEddard chuckled derisively.  “I’d like to see the witch or wizard who tries to play on your age once you’ve broken the record for completed OWLs.  The only person who’s come close to fifteen was Nicholas Flamel with two less at thirteen.”AWhich was exactly Hadrian’s point.A“NEWTs.”  Ollivander stated.  “What’s your plan there?  Something even more shocking I would assume.”A“Well…”A“Hadrian.”A“Eighteen.”AOllivander wandlessly summoned his bottle of cognac.  He had a feeling he’d need it to get through the rest of this interview.A“And a couple extra classes that I want to take but don’t want or need a NEWT in.”AEddard paused in pouring his highball, switching it for a tall glass instead then taking deep drink.A“It’s not physically possible Hadrian.”  Eddard said slowly once he’d calmed his nerves.  “Even if you utilize a time-turner the demand on your body and magic for that many classes will be substantial – even for you.  Besides that taking eighteen or twenty or more classes…what are you going to do, bring in private Masters to help you through?”AIt was the only way he could see it working – in theory.APrivate tutoring would allow the boy-King to take classes where he could with his fellow students and still manage to take that many tests.AEven for a prodigy it was extreme in the extreme.A“Not a time-turner.”  Hadrian grinned brightly, devilment in his eyes.  “A time-field.”A“Time-fields and the magic to use them have been lost.”  Eddard stated in a near-drawl as he studied the play of the firelight on the amber liquid in his glass.A“So was Avalon.”AWhere there was that.A“The Founders built a time-field into Hogwarts.”  Hadrian grinned, nearly bouncing in his seat at the possibilities.  “All I need to do is find and access the entrance from the Royal suite in the Castle and I can take as many subjects as I want.”AYes, yes he could.  Eddard had to concede.  Time-fields worked much differently than time-turners.  Where a time-turner worked to flit back and forth in time, theoretically giving one the extra they needed to accomplish important work, a time-field was actually a time-distortion or displacement field.  It – according to legend – could either slow down or speed up time inside of it, allowing a person inside the field to do things like study an impossible amount of subjects.AThere was a drawback, however.AInside the field time continued to pass – Hadrian would continue to age.AIf he used it too much he could massively shorten his lifespan, a risk Eddard immediately cautioned him of.AHadrian set to soothing his Headmaster’s worry.A“I’m only going to use it once I reach sixteen and am working on NEWTs,” he admitted.  “Unless there’s some kind of dire need before that.  If I limit myself to an average of three and a half hours per day for the two NEWTs years, with an extra cushion of five eight-hour days per month, I’ll lose approximately just shy of four months of my life.  Four months versus permanently silencing any detractors regarding my readiness to rule.  It seems worth it to me.”AEddard found that hard to argue with though he was prepared to try until he saw the look in the young man’s eyes.  They were firm and as piercing as the emerald-eyed preteen’s ever-present sword.  There would be no swaying him from his decision.AThe Headmaster cut to the chase, wanting to finish the interview before Hadrian gave him a permanent ulcer with his insane plans.A“What Masteries?”A“Magical Law, Magical-Mundane Finance, Defense, and Warding would be best.”  Hadrian shrugged.  Warding and Defense were the only ones he truly wanted to Master considering both his temperament and natural affinities.  He was tempted to try Spell Weaving and Dark Arts or Ritual Magic but the four he’d picked are most likely to be useful to his future.APlus he’d become fascinated with warding after seeing the ward schemas that Avalon uses.A“Excellent choices for a King.”  Ollivander nodded.  “Are you going to continue with your Mundane education?”AHadrian nodded.  “Remus thinks with the Holmes’s help I can get into a specialized distance program Oxford offers for prodigies and other working or employed students like athletes.  Probably just a generalized degree in liberal studies will give me the foundation I need for dealing with Mundane politics and politicians.”A“You’re very good at taking advice, Hadrian.”  Eddard sighed, worried for the boy and feeling sympathy for his werewolf friend.  “I can’t help but wonder how much of this aggressive education plan is Hadrian’s and how much was designed for and geared towards the King of Avalon.”  The Headmaster took the completed parchment from its floating position and gestured the young man from the room.  “Enjoy the rest of your day, Your Grace.”A…ALater that night, Hadrian rehashed his meeting with Wills over their mirrors.  After leaving school he’d been shuttled straight into his music and languages lessons before going over plans for the Lordship Ball with Lady Maggie and Dowager Lady Longbottom as well as dealing with a few State issues with Sherrinford and Lucius.  Now he and Wills were both talking in their beds, lap desks in place as they dashed off the homework from their sole lecture on Magical Theory they’d been assigned.  Twelve inches on accidental versus intentional magic.AHadrian had already done this sort of essay a couple years ago for Remus while Wills had covered it more recently with Andy so neither had to give it their full attention.A“Wow, he really said that?”  Wills asked after Hadrian was finished recounting the conversation with the Headmaster.  “I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone talk to you like that before.”A“Believe me, they do.”  Hadrian told him with a roll of his eyes as he studied his work critical of any errors.  “They just do it in private.  Sirius and Remus especially can be harsh.  I think it’s cause they’ve known me all my life.  And they knew my parents.  Everyone else…not so much.  My Papa Siger can be tough, so can the other Holmeses but not quite like that.”A“Mmm.”  Wills hummed, nodding his head absently as he proof-read his own work.A“How did your interview go?”A“Better than yours, sounds like.”  Wills gave Rian a cheesy grin.  “But then I’m going for a much more reasonable two Masteries and a Mundane degree.  Not trying to set records in OWLs and NEWTs like some people I know, Rian.”A“Yuck it up.”  Hadrian shook his head with a sigh.  “I’ll manage it, you wait and see.”A“I know you will, Rian.”  Wills gave him a soft look.  “I’m just worried about you overextending yourself, we all are.”A“I’m not impossible.”  Hadrian assured his bonded.  “Nor completely intractable.  If it’s too much, it’s too much and I’ll cut back.  But that’s a worry for another day, several years off.  What Masteries did you decide on?”  He got back on topic.  “I know you were debating several.”AAnd William had.  With his bonded’s new education reforms a whole world of Masteries had opened up to students in Wizarding Britain without them having to study as foreign schools.  It made for an intense couple weeks as he went over and over the options both new and old with Andromeda as well as asking his Grandmother and Hadrian for their opinions.AAs long as he also obtained his Mundane degree, his parents were appeased – for the moment.A“Healing and Defense I think.”  Wills imparted to his Rian.  “I guess Healing runs in the Nimue lines and I Inherited the affinity with my Claiming.  Andy had me do some exercises and test spells on one of Grandmother’s sick corgis.”  His blue eyes glinted with pride.  “Worked like…well…a Charm.  And Andy has a dab hand with Defense spells.”A“She’s a Black.”  Hadrian finished his essay with a flair of his fountain pen and tried it with a spell, rolling it up and sealing it with another and sending it to rest safely in his school bag.  It wasn’t due until next week but better to get it over and done with now.  “We’ve all an affinity for Defense and some of us for Dark Arts, Astronomy, or Ritual Magic.  It’s one of the more diverse lines that still has definite affinities.  It’s why Siri was able to become a Master Auror so young and now Dora is following in his boot-prints.  Potter has it too, so does Pendragon, Gryffindor, Peverell, Valerius, Wallace, and Shacklebolt.  A Defense affinity is one that tends to stay true in a line despite intermarriages with lines that have other affinities.”A“No wonder you wipe the floor with me when we have mock-duels.”  Wills gasped as if coming to some great realization instead of just teasing his bonded.  “You’ve a massive advantage!  Those are almost all your Lines!”  Voice turning more serious he smiled.  “Guess we’ll have at least one class in common then when we start our Masteries.”A“Most likely.”  Hadrian gave a happy grin, not put-off at all over Wills’s twitting.  “We’ll still have to apply to which Professor we want to proctor our apprenticeships but considering who we are as long as we’re not total dunderheads we’ll probably be able to have the same Master.”A“Good.”  Wills nodded firmly as he finished his own homework.  “I have to share you enough between your other future consorts and classes.  No need to split us up even more by having different proctors for our apprenticeships.  What’s your day look like tomorrow?”A“Meetings first thing after breakfast,” Hadrian leaned back against his pillows and lifted the mirror in his hand to face Wills directly.  “Then we have to hash out the temporary relocation to Snowdon Castle.  Lesson before and through lunch, which I’ll have to take in my study, then going to Snowdon with Lady Bones and the guard to finish sentencing on some of the lesser offenders before the big trials and executions.”AWills grimaced at that.  He didn’t like to think about what his Rian was having to do.  They were only eleven.  They shouldn’t have to sentence traitors to death but it was what the Law demanded.  He just hoped his uncles and foster-brothers would be there to support him when Wills couldn’t.  Times like this were when he actually regretted that they wouldn’t be married and living together for another couple years.AHonestly if it wasn’t for the consummation clause in their Contract, Wills was tempted to move up the wedding just to get it over with.  Rian had quickly become his best-friend and he wanted to be there to support him all the time – the way Rian somehow managed to support Wills even with the distance between them.  The mirrors they were using to talk just being one example.AThe carriage to sooth his mum’s temper being another.A“Music lessons after dinner.”  Hadrian shrugged.  “Not too bad now that Remus is back from his tour of our territories.  But Papa Siger is about to be very busy with the influx of dignitaries so it’ll balance out with my Council having to step in a little on my governance lessons with him busy.”A“When’s the move to Snowdon?”A“Next week.”  Hadrian grimaced.  “We barely settle into the new schedule with H.I. and we have to move residences for a month.”A“At least in Wales it’ll be easier to get to your cello and Krav Maga lessons.”  Wills tried to brighten Rian’s outlook.  “Maybe you’ll be able to see some of your holding as well.”A“Maybe.”  Hadrian agreed mostly for Wills’s sake.  His bonded wasn’t yet in the thick of things and didn’t entirely understand how packed his schedule tended to be.  Some weeks he had to mutiny to get any time to himself.  “Speaking of holdings…”A“Yes…”  Wills drawled copying his bonded around a yawn.  It’d been a long day for both boys.A“You’ll never believe what I own ninety percent of…”A…AThe next day passed exactly as Hadrian had described it to William, barring his massive “geek-out” over the grand stair the led to the main ballroom in Snowdon Castle.AIts steps were fashioned entirely of a black and grey flecked emerald green marble but that wasn’t what Hadrian had a total kid-moment over.ARather, it was the banister itself and the railing.AForged by Goblin Masters according to the makers marks he found near the base of the banister on the lower landing in the ballroom, the banister itself was the smooth, sinuous back and tails of several dragons that appeared to race from the top to the bottom of the stair on the left side and from bottom to top on the right.  The support rails became the faces, wings, talons, and legs of the dragons in their flight with lighter wisps giving the sensation of clouds and sky.  And crouched upon the posts at the top and bottom landings were four dragons in mid-roar, showing off glistening mithril fangs, all various colors of Welsh and Irish dragons.AHadrian dubbed it the “Dragon Stair” and was heinously hard to convince to move once he’d found it, though the threat of Lady Bones having to come search him out had him advancing according to Siger’s wishes.AIf it had just been him, Siri, and Remy they’d still be there taking turns sliding down the banister or examining the workmanship of the artistry.AEven Avalon didn’t have anything quite like it to compare.AWills was suitably impressed with the pictures Hadrian had taken with his new camera – a gift from Remus’s travels over the summer – and was looking forward to seeing it and the rest of Snowdon Castle when he came for the Lordship Ball.AThat night during their now-nightly talks via mirror, William had news of his own, surprising his bonded with his agreement to be officially announced as Hadrian’s bonded and future Consort of House Emrys at the Lordship Ball.  Hadrian had been extremely understanding of Wills wanting to protect his privacy, even going so far as to delay the traditional introduction at the Ball for another time until his bonded was more comfortable.  That he wouldn’t have to stage another mutiny – this time against almost all of the “adults” in his life – a subjective term since with his Claiming Hadrian was legally an adult in the Wizarding World in his own right, as was William – that he wasn’t entirely sure would succeed.ABetter for everyone involved that William agreed.AHe wouldn’t want to completely override his Council and former guardians in such an important matter.AThere was no question that he would do it if backed into a corner…but he didn’t want to.AWilliam’s decision had put off that inevitable confrontation for another day.ASnowdon Castle was night-and-day to Avalon.ABuilt entirely of native Welsh stone, it stood proud and grey against the September sky, standing as a bastion of a by-gone era at the top of Snowdon Mountain.    Where Skye Palace was creamy and elegant with gemstone rivers running through it, Snowdon was grey and flecked with the colors of its Royal Family, in the solid square architecture found all over Europe.  Towers and murder holes, trebuchets and turrets, Snowdon was built to stand against all challengers.AThe interior was worn smooth by both craftsmen and time, the massive great hall leading down into to the cavernous ballroom/royal reception area by way of the nearly out-of-place Dragon Stair.AAncient tapestries lined the walls, softening the grey stone and thick carpets from far-off realms and allied countries cushioned the bedrooms, suites, and private areas away from the public rooms.AMassive, ancient from a time before Avalon, and welcoming to Hadrian as the last Emrys.AHe adored it on sight, though nothing would ever replace Skye Palace in his heart, and assured William that he would like it as well.AHadrian yawned, bidding William goodnight.ATomorrow was another packed day, between H.I., his King and Lordship duties, and his private tuition in mundane subjects.AThankfully he had trusted people to take care of the details of the Royal removal to Snowdon for a fortnight, otherwise he wouldn’t have time to eat let alone talk to his bonded.AWhich reminded him.AHe needed to make sure and start checking his paired journal that was linked to Octavian’s.  The teen had promised to start writing him at the end of the week.  Like many other Heirs and children of important Nobles, Octavian was going to be at his Lordship Ball.AHadrian really, really wanted a better idea about him before he saw him again.AAnd a better idea about why he made his insides all…tingly.A…A ",The Avalon Seven,108617

these are going to “skip along” over the next two years.  During that time there will be parts where you see a “day in the life” happening which will continue throughout the story even if I skip a month or more at a time.  The highlight for this chapter is the Lordship Ball, the next chapter should cover from Yule through Wills’ and Tavi’s birthdays then the one after that will cover from Hadrian’s twelfth birthday through Yule if that makes sense.  It’s currently planned to take a total of six or seven chapters to get to Wills and Hadrian’s wedding and the coronation ceremony to follow.  You will get to see snippets of the education system and how H.I. works during that time as well as some more nitty-gritty political scheming.  To answer the questions regarding SLASH yes this is a male-only harem though you will see some flirtation between Hadrian and some female possible consorts.  The first actual SLASH scene will happen sometime between the wedding of Wills and Hadrian and Hadrian’s fourteen birthday but it will be what I call slash-light because of the age factor.  Nothing too outlandish will happen until after Hadrian’s fourteenth which is around ten chapters away.AATo answer the question regarding length…well…this is going to be like Starlight’s Rise of the Drackens.  I love it and adore it so it will have some one-shots that don’t hit in the story as a whole that will be posted on their own as part of the Avalon series.  Right now I can see this being over a hundred chapters just to get him through school and part of his planned Masteries.  Basically as long as people are still reading and enjoying this I’ll keep writing it.AAChapter Thirteen: Introducing…AWednesday brought another day of lessons and getting to know their peers for Hadrian and William, unsurprisingly to those who knew them well Hadrian was quickly falling into a friendship with the Malfoy Heir whose snarky commentary tended to keep the King in stiches during breaks and mealtimes at H.I.William was likewise enjoying Draco’s company though he still preferred “His Rian” over the other wizarding children.  He had however taken nicely to the shier (and calmer) Longbottom Heir versus the more excitable Draco.  A turn of events that pleased both Hadrian and the adults in all four Heirs/Lord’s lives.Once Thursday and Friday came and went, taking Hadrian’s private lessons and another day at H.I. with them respectively, it was time for more trials at Snowdon – including that of the former Minister and his cabinet.Lady Amelia’s goal was to clear the Snowdon cells before Hadrian’s Lordship Ball.  Having several hundred guests – including those who were avowed Death Eaters who weren’t possible to charge or try at the moment – and dignitaries arriving at the Castle starting the next weekend wasn’t conducive to keeping the prisoners secure, a problem both Sirius and Remus readily agreed with.However, there were three prisoners in particular who couldn’t be released – simply because they were still gathering witness statements and evidence as well as letting them sweat.Vernon, Petunia, and Marge Dursley were promptly moved from the bowels of Snowdon Castle into an undisclosed location – one of Hadrian’s many properties – and placed under a twenty-four/seven guard until they could be moved back to the prison cells of Snowdon.When it came to prisoners no one wanted to chance escaping, they three were the only ones Hadrian’s wasn’t willing to just judge and sentence.They would be taken care of before his coronation but for now at least he was content to let them stew.Siri, Remy, and surprisingly – or maybe not – Lord Prince had all smirked upon hearing of his intransience regarding his abusers and all made comments to the tone of him taking after his mother more than they’d previously thought.Of all the “Marauders” James’s Lily was the single most vindictive and capable of holding a grudge even better than Padfoot.Time passed quickly following the trials.Those who were handed down a prison sentence were moved to Azkaban – ghastly guards or not – and those to be executed were held in abeyance in the Avalon City holding cells until the day after Hadrian’s Lordship Ball and the beginning of the Fall Wizengamot session.Before he knew it – and with his head spinning from dashing from H.I. to private lessons to King and Lordship duties and back – the eve of the Ball was upon him, bringing with it a sharp jolt to his system and upsetting his equilibrium……“Lord Wallace, your Grace.”  Russel announced Hadrian’s next appointment.  “Accompanied by David, Heir Wallace.”Hadrian looked up from the order of event for the following day surprised by the formal tone his secretary was using.  Once their relationship had been mostly repaired, Hadrian and Gawain had gone back to their accustomed familiarity except in on some occasions.  Apparently this was one such occasion though for the life of him Hadrian didn’t have the foggiest idea what for.“Lord and Heir Wallace.”  Hadrian folded his hands elegantly before him on the leather desk blotter – temporarily cleared for the meeting of its usual piles and piles of parchment, quills and ink, and tomes.  The King of Avalon was dressed in his best – Queen Acromantula silk tunic and dress trousers with an over-robe in the dueler’s style he’d made all the rage in the deep royal purple of Avalon with the embroidered Crests of his Houses depicted in a white diamond and mithril thread created solely for the Avalonian Kings.Other empires and kingdoms had similar combinations for formal robes using mithril, crushed gemstones, and alchemy but white diamond and mithril was Avalon’s alone.“How can We be of service this evening?”Both the Lord and Heir were also attired in the formal dueling robes their former ward and friend had made the fashion among the still-fit (unlike some of the more devout trenchermen such as Lord Parkinson) and fashionable, though the Wallaces were wearing their own colors in fine linen and leather of forest green and sable-brown, the Wallace clan tartan apparent in a sash slashing from shoulder to waist across their chests, held in place by a golden pin with the sword and shield of their House in green garnets.“The House of Wallace has come to discuss the standing Contract between our two Houses, your Grace.”  Gawain answered, no sign of his dismay regarding his son and heir’s plan evident in his voice.He hoped to Hecate David had thought this through.It wasn’t the sort of thing that one could back out of or change their mind later.  Once it was done, it was done.  No matter the fit Rhys would throw.Hadrian mentally switched over from King of Avalon to Lord of Pevensie as that was the House in question that had an active Contract with House Wallace, a switch that showed in the slightest of easing in his deportment and posture.“What regarding said Contract does the House of Wallace wish to broach with the House of Pevensie at this very important – and busy – time?”  The Lord asked with mild reproof.  No matter what, tonight he was only introducing Wills as the Betrothed of House Emrys and his future Consort.  It was their night, despite what schemes his Steward had hatched while Hadrian was occupied with school, tutors, and getting Avalon back up and running properly.He’d barely had time to sleep, eat, and talk with Wills and Tavi via mirror and journal let alone worry over what his Privy Councilors were up to in their own very limited free time.David traded a look with his father and stepped forward after taking a fortifying breath.  He wasn’t absolutely sure this was the best idea he’d ever had – especially with the way things stood with his mother’s scheming.  He knew Hadrian hated the thought of someone else making choices for him – his young friend had complained about it enough when he was home from Hogwarts and could give Hadrian his attention and council.But there wasn’t another acceptable choice.Left to his own devices – and with the funk he’d been in for more than a year – Rhys would ruin House Wallace and embarrass the Empire of Avalon during a decade they as a people simply couldn’t afford his tantrums and schemes.Really when it came down to it, it was David’s only option to prevent the looming hurricane of destruction from tainting his proud family and shattering his beloved father – and his long-time friend – all at the same time.He wasn’t sure what Rhys would do now but he did know what he couldn’t – and that was fuck around on the King of blood Avalon.Rhys had asked him too many pointed question regarding the exact terms of the Contract between House Wallace and the contracted House – though he still wasn’t aware it was with Hadrian – and how to break it.David wasn’t going to let his little brother break Hadrian’s heart and ruin their family because Rhys was going through a pissy phase that had no sign of ending or clearing any-when soon.It had left him with a single – though not unpalatable – option.“I want you to choose me as your Betrothed and future Consort of House Pevensie.”…As the door closed behind the two Wallaces, Hadrian collapsed back against his supremely-comfortable leather desk chair and heaved a sigh before turning toward the warded corner.Wills and Tavi both stepped out, having taken their places through a hidden corridor upon being silently summoned and given directions by Hadrian.  He’d sent for his Bonded-Betrothed and his Intended-Betrothed when the two Wallaces had entered his study in Snowdown Castle.  The King had surmised at a glance what the topic of discussion would be and wanted the presence – though concealed from Gawain and David – of his two future-Consorts.They would have to live with either David or Rhys after all, just as much if not more than he himself.While Hadrian wasn’t going to make decisions like this purely based on his Consorts’ or future-Consorts’ opinions and desires he would take them under consideration, much as he always or at least generally listens to his Privy Council before making a decision that effects Avalon.He may have the final say but that didn’t necessitate him having the only say.Tavi was dressed similarly to David as the Heir of House Prince – barring the tartan and pin in preference to having the Prince Crest embroidered on the left breast of his dark blue and oyster outer robe in gold-and-merlinite thread as was appropriate for an Heir of a Most Ancient and Noble House.On the other hand as Wills was the bonded-betrothed of the King of Avalon as well as being the Lord of Nimue in his own right, his tunic trousers and outer robe were all in Acromantula silk, though the light blue and silver of House Nimue was replaced with a lighter purple than Hadrian’s – it was more of a lavender shade – while the crushed aquamarine and platinum embroidery of a Lord of an Utmost Ancient and Noble House was still in place depicting the proper adornments for a Lord as well as the Crests of both House Nimue and House Emrys.And Wills had thought the fittings for his betrothal robes were a headache, they were nothing compared to the dickering over the proper colors, materials, devices, etc. for his formal “introduction” robes.Hadrian summed up the feelings of everyone in the study quite succinctly:“What in the bloody hell was that?”His two future consorts lowered themselves with similar grace into the plush armchairs flanking the fireplace as he moved to join them, flopping with much less elegance into the center seat in an outward sign of his tumultuous internal ramblings.Wills turned to the older Octavian.“You’re closest in age to David and in the same year as Rhys if I have it right.”  His Rian had covered some of the “possibles” with him when they had sat down and discussed Octavian himself.  Wills had wanted more information about just whom he might possibly have to share his husband with.One thing was for certain: after that conversation – which included the tidbit that one of the oldest “possibles” was in his seventies – Wills was much much happier about Octavian.At least Tavi wasn’t old enough to be their grandfather.Thankfully that particular candidate was one of several dozen offspring of the Japanese Emperor, the youngest of whom was only seven.Randy old goat.Tavi nodded, a light scowl reminiscent of his pater pinching his classical handsomeness.“What do you make of all that?”  Wills posed the question equally to his two companions.His Rian and Tavi exchanged a look then Tavi nodded for Rian to go first.“It was out of character.”  Hadrian sighed and let his head fall back to stare up at the lofty ceiling that soared above them.“Very much so.”  Tavi concurred.  “For all that he’s been heavily pursued – by both genders – there’s never been a whiff of him being interested in settling down.  Hogwarts rumors have it that he’s been tossing around the idea of becoming a Curse-Breaker before settling down into his duties as Heir.”Hadrian nodded absently, knowing the two Wallace brothers better than most.  “David has always had a bit of the devil in him.  Even convinced Gawain to allow him to sit in on my Dark Arts tutoring since before this coming year formal training in Dark Arts and other ‘Dark’ and obscure magics weren’t offered at Hogwarts.  And getting a NEWT in the Dark Arts as well as in Defense and Ritual Magics with a Mastery in Warding are all required for a Curse-Breaker.”There was a reason Gringotts valued their Curse-Breakers so highly – and it showed in how well they were treated and paid by the notoriously tight-fisted goblins.  In the last decade only six Curse-Breakers had achieved the title, one of which was the new Lord Weasley.  If David managed it he would be the seventh in twelve years.“It doesn’t make sense.”  Octavian gestured smoothly with one elegant, long-fingered hand.  “Rhys would be the obvious choice – and has made his preference or lack of one regarding male or female partners clear.  Does David even like males in that way?”The question was clearly aimed both at Hadrian and the ether.His intended just shrugged.“I hope so since he just put himself forward to have a husband rather than a wife.”  Wills observed dryly making all three of them chuckle after a moment.“That wouldn’t stop him.”  Hadrian grimaced.  “I know David well and Gawain almost better than anyone.  If they think it’s a matter of honor or family or valor they wouldn’t care about whether David would rather shag a man, a woman, or a sheep.  He would still put himself forward to be my consort with his Lord and father’s whole-hearted approval.”“Like that are they?”  The Slytherin arched a brow.  He’d never paid too close attention to the Wallace Heir as he was both two years above him in age as well as a staunch Gryffindor – though not as pompous or prattish as that lot can be.  “Gryffindors.”Hadrian stuck out his tongue and gestured to himself with an exaggerated wave of his arm.  “Gryffindor.”  He smirked.  “The Gryffindor, actually.”“You’re also The Slytherin.”  Tavi shot back before shaking his head ruefully.  “Whatever am I going to do with you?”“I’m sure you’ll think of something.”  Wills muttered, knowing full-well about the older boy’s habit of discomfiting Hadrian with his overt sensuality.  He raised his voice to an audible-level.  “I don’t think it matters much about House with Rian being also The Hufflepuff and The Ravenclaw.  Moving on.”  He rolled his eyes as both the King of Avalon and the Heir of Prince barely refrained from pouting at him for spoiling their barrage of verbal darts at each other before they could begin.  “What about Rhys?  If like Rian says, David would do this out of a sense of honor or duty to his family, how does Rhys come into play?”“That.”  Tavi rubbed his temples as he closed his eyes wearily.  “May be the pertinent question.”Hadrian slowly rose to sit upright, his face and eyes clearly showing deep thought before his emerald gaze froze over upon reaching a realization.“Rhys isn’t happy about the Contract.”  He explained slowly.  “No one has told him who it’s with but he’s complained here and there about it, commiserating and wanting commiseration from me over it…”  He trailed off, not wanting to finish his thought.Octavian had no problem finishing it.“He’s a slag.”  Hadrian’s intended gave a derisive scoff, finally able to tell his future husband what he thought about his friend in a context where it wouldn’t come off as sour grapes over their close relationship growing up or Tavi’s own expectation of being celibate.  “All of Hogwarts knows it and his older brother definitely does.  They’ve had some epic rows over Rhys’s behavior with boys and girls of all Houses and ages.  And with Rhys being in Slytherin rather than Gryffindor, they mostly have had those rows in at least semi-public places.”“I’d say that would give David and his father cause for concern over the Contract.”  Wills noted sardonically as the light dawned for all concerned over the driving force behind the meeting.  “They’re scared shitless that Rhys is going to break the contract by doing what he does best if chosen – screwing around.”Hadrian clenched his jaw as he held onto his temper by the skin of his teeth.  He wanted to rant and rave over Gawain trying to manage him once again but he knew he couldn’t or at least shouldn’t.  This wasn’t so much Gawain trying manage Hadrian after all as it was a Lord trying to protect the honor and reputation of both his House and that of his liege Lord and King.Said King wasn’t happy about how he’d gone about it but his couldn’t bring himself to fault him for it – especially in light of the “conversation” he’d had with Lord Prince before taking Severus into his service.Threatening to behead his future father-in-law wasn’t much different than Gawain trying to keep his own son from betraying his King by committing what would be no less than adultery.“Motives aside.”  Hadrian waved one arm as if clearing an invisible board.  “What do the two of you think of David’s…well…proposal?”“I liked him.”  Wills shrugged.  “Granted I don’t know him, not like you and not even with the simple familiarity Octavian had with him, but he seemed…confident.”  Wills settled on a word with a sharp nod.  “Knows who he is and what he’s after.  And it doesn’t hurt that he’s handsome as all hell.”“Hell would be appropriate.”  Octavian drawled lightly.  “He’s darker than I am and nearly a bloody giant with that combination of Italian and Scots blood running through his veins.  But.”  He had to concede.  “He’s alright – for a bloody Gryffindor.”David Wallace topped most men at six-foot seven-inches in height and a thickly-muscled build he inherited from his swordsman-father that kept him handsome rather than pretty with the fine bone structure and lush black hair he got from his mother.“But I don’t think you have the ability to add another courtship into the mix right now.”  Wills added hastily.  “With school and well, us.  Either courting or being courted, I’d give him an answer either way you decided and then set a date for when the two of you will start all of that and leave it until then.”“Seconded.”  Tavi gave a sharp nod of his head, making his long hair wave behind him.“The motion carries.”  Hadrian gave them both a quirk of his mouth and rose to his feet.  “Now let us meet with our respective parents or in my case mother-hens before the Princess of Wales scalps me bald.”…The cavernous Great Hall of Snowdown Castle flowed seamlessly into the Grand Ballroom on the night of Hadrian’s Lordship Ball through a tricky bit of elf magic that turned a blank wall into an ornate archway with a flawless translocation charm.  Guests walked smoothly from one to the other and back, catching up, gossiping, seeing and being seen in the elegantly decorated ballroom and the overwhelming grandeur of the Hall.  Everyone who was anyone from all over the world was present, soaking in a cross between modern elegance and olde-world traditions that brought to mind the grand balls of the early nineteen and late eighteen hundreds.Head Chatelaine the Dowager Lady Longbottom alongside the Chatelaine for Wales Lady “Maggie” Holmes with help from the “Sisters Black” Lady Andromeda Tonks nee Black and Lady Narcissa Malfoy nee Black had toiled relentlessly for weeks making sure that every detail from the flowers – heavy on the lilies in honor of the late Lady Potter – to the freshest of enchanted beeswax candles to the final polish on the ancient Emrys throne in the Great Hall were seen to.  Nothing – great or small – escaped the gimlet eyes of the Ladies and their House Elf helpers.  Snowdon Castle shone – from candle to crystal to gemstones – and everyone who mattered in the greater Wizarding World shone right along with it, bearing witness to the greatness of the revived Avalonian monarchy.Nothing less would do and the Ladies being who they were, they settled for nothing less.Ambassadors from all over rubbed elbows with the nobility of every magical country.  Lords and Ladies and Heirs of all levels and estates played nice – for once – no matter their political affiliations or personal ideals.  Not a single soul was going to take a chance on offending the King of Avalon.Even if it meant being pleasant, congenial, or simply ignoring the sheer gall of the King to invite the mundane British Royal Family – rumored betrothal or not.Hadrian and Wills awaited their cue, concealed at the top of the Dragon Stair that led down into the Grand Ballroom.A fanfare sounded.Exchanging a quick smile, Hadrian offered his bonded betrothed his arm then as one they descended the Dragon Stair at the far end of the Grand Ballroom while Sherrinford as the Lord High Chancellor “introduced” them.“Presenting His Grace.”  Sherrinford took ample advantage of the Sonorous charm, allowing his smooth baritone to thunder through the temporarily-twinned rooms.  “Hadrian Augustus: Lord of the Royal House of Emrys.  Lord of the Royal House of Pendragon.  Lord of the Royal House of LeFey.  Lord of the Royal House of Ravenclaw.  Lord of the Royal House of Slytherin.  Lord of the Royal House of Gryffindor.  Lord of the Royal House of Hufflepuff.  Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Peverell.”A whisper of sound travelled through the crowd as those who recognized the legends surrounding the House of Peverell gasped, choked, or cursed in wonder under their collective breath.  Hadrian and Wills paid them no mind, having just made it with stately grace to the archway connecting the Great Hall and Grand Ballroom.  Sherrinford wouldn’t have stopped in “his moment” for all the gold in Gringotts.“Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Pevensie.  Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Valerius.  Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.  Lord of the Aged and Noble House of Evans.”Another whisper – though this time it was more of a rumble – as those stick-up-their-arse bigots who’d scoffed at having a half-blood as King realized that the late Lady Potter was no more a muggleborn than she was a jackrabbit.“King of the Empire of Avalon and Lord and Emperor of all Her Territories.  Hecate and Loki keep him safe and strong in magic.  Long may he Reign.”“Long may he Reign.”  The crowd echoed just as Hadrian and Wills had made it up the steps to the dais that was centered at the front of the Great Hall.  Some with more…verve…than others, though none dared remain silent.The dais was as ancient as the Castle it was located in and held a pair of equally-ancient thrones: one for the Lord and one for a Consort.Hadrian’s throne was elaborately carved with runes and sigils harkening from long before the Emrys family was Blessed with Magic, they’d been warriors and tribal chieftains long before they were magical royalty.  Made of strong and sacred ash wood, it had been polished to a luxurious sheen.  It’s match was fashioned from cherry wood and all but gleamed under its own coat of polish, though it was clearly much newer than it’s mate, Wills’ throne still predated those they would use in Avalon.As the crowd spoke the word “Reign” and Hadrian and Wills turned to face the gathered mass, a wave of magic clapped and crashed as golden and purple as well as green and silver sparks of pure Magic rained down on the two young Lords.A Blessing indeed from Magic herself as well as the “God and Goddess” of Magic.All in attendance gasped and either bowed or curtsied at the obvious signal from the ether.Hadrian withheld the impulse to smirk at the sight of his Uncles Siri and Remy, along with his other mundane – or nearly mundane – former guardians bowing.Siri had bet him ten galleons that Sherlock if no one else would forbear to bow during his introduction – a bet that cost him with the cue from the powers that be.“Thank you.”  Hadrian gave what was nothing less than a kingly nod and a wave of his hand.  In the aftermath of the magical display he had no need of a sonorous to be heard.  “Please rise.”Sherrinford cleared his throat and continued once all and sundry were on their feet once more.“Presenting His Grace.”  William took a small step forward at Hadrian’s prompting.  “William Alexander.  Bonded-Betrothed of His Grace King Hadrian Augustus Emrys-Pendragon.  Future Consort of the Royal House of Emrys.  Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Nimue.  Hecate and Loki bless him and make him wise.  Long may he live.”“Long may he live.”  The crowd again answered dutifully.  After their last refrain none dared to keep silent, lest they face a magical backlash.  No matter how they personally felt about the new Lord Nimue, Future-Consort Emrys and his supposedly “dirty” blood.The two monarchs – or future monarchs in the case of Wills – sat in unison with regal aplomb.A moment’s pause for the runner to disappear and the crowd to fill-in as magically as the lush carpet as appeared and the group split, and Hadrian stood once more.With a wave of his hand two sets of chairs appeared, each flanking a side of the dais.  Those familiar with the introduction protocols of Avalon nodded in knowing approval while the rest shifted restlessly among themselves.  Another wave of his hand and a low table appeared before him.  It had a table runner of fine silk in deep emerald and was fashioned of strong oak.  In the center of the runner was a scroll, flanked itself by a pair of stands, one holding medallions and the other a series of smaller scrolls.One last moment to cast a wandless-wordless Sonorous and Hadrian began, Wills moving to his side to assist him.“As is tradition, dating back to the first King of Avalon.”  Hadrian’s voice was rich and carried well.  “With the introduction of each King come various appointments.  Rather than hold my people in further suspense, We shall wait no longer to introduce those appointed.”Flicking his wrist he had the scroll unroll itself and begin to hover.“As Lord High Chancellor of Avalon.”  Sherrinford moved over to stand before the King, accepting the scroll containing his official certificate of office from Wills and allowing Hadrian to place the Seal of his Office around his neck.  “We appoint the Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Holmes, Sherrinford Delancy Holmes.”“As Lord High Steward,” Gawain mimicked Sherrinford’s movements as the Chancellor found his seat in the grouping of chairs to the left of the dais.  “We appoint the Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Wallace, Lord Gawain David Wallace.”“As Lord High Ambassador.”  Siger followed protocol flawlessly, as was expected.  “We appoint the Lord of Ravenscroft: Lord Siger Mycroft Holmes.”Some rumbles came from the crowd as a few of the purists reacted to the new King of Avalon appointing a near-squib and mundane Lord to his Privy Council.Not that their outrage mattered or was even a concern.There was piss-all they could or would do about it.Amelia’s appointment as Lord High Justice was greeted with much less mumbling as she joined her fellow councilors in their seats – an appointment nearly overlooked in the uproar to follow.“As Lord High Constable.”  Hadrian took a deep breath and looked into quicksilver eyes that were for once solemn.  “We appoint our House Member and Godfather, the Honorable and Noble Lord Sirius Orion Black.”Forget about the squib, the masses were much more up-in-arms over having a former convict – innocence or no – as their High Constable.A clap of thunder shook the room as Hadrian flexed his power in a wordless reprimand.Lest all and sundry forget, there was more to being King than an accident of birth.Eyes wide, the rabble and actual honored guests quieted.“As Lord High Treasurer.”  Hadrian’s smile could draw blood it was so sharp and his bright gaze dared the horde to make further arses of themselves.  “The Honorable Goblin Ragnok of the English Goblin Horde.”Outrage gave way to simple disbelief and stunned silence.The King of Avalon was trusting the finances of the Empire to a goblin.Savvy investors actually applauded the appointment.  With a goblin overseeing the Empire’s gold, it would do nothing but thrive.  It was simple good business any way one looked at it.“To the Seat of Lord of the Privy Seal.”  The crowd waited with baited breath after the last several controversial appointments.  Hadrian didn’t disappoint.  Arms bared and bare for all to see, Lucius took his place among his new colleagues.  “Lord of the Aged and Noble House of Malfoy, Lord Lucius Abraxas Malfoy.”Sandringham Bones’s – Amelia’s younger brother’s – appointment to Lord Chamberlin was almost a letdown to the gossip mongers.  There was nary a thing to object about when it came to the young – relatively – wizard.The next appointment more than made up for the lull in controversial appointments.“For the Lord Protector of Avalon.”  Hadrian’s voice was soft and steely.  “None would do but one who We trust absolutely and without reservation.  Therefore We appoint the Honorable Alpha Remus John Lupin.”Remus ignored the gasps and took his place with stern decorum as Hadrian waited with undisguised impatience for the nobles to silence themselves lest he let off another shot of thunder.“As Lord Marshal of Avalon, a seat long upheld with honor and valor by the House of du Lac,” Hadrian locked eyes with the du Lac Lord who had refused all his demands to meet with the King.  Over his dead body would that old bastard gain a Seat on his Council.  Thankfully there was a much more palatable option in the man’s Heir, a dueling master and Master Auror of an age with Siger.  “We hereby appoint the Heir of the Ancient and Noble House of du Lac, Heir Armand Gervais du Lac.”Lord du Lac had to swallow his bile and grit his teeth at the obvious snub – from both that damned infant of a would-be King and from his rebellious Heir.And pisser was that even with this latest action from Armand unless he wanted to directly flout the new King – not a wise decision following this snub, Gervais readily understood that he was on thin-ice with the monarchy – there wasn’t a damned thing he could do against either the King or his obstinate Heir.Gervais couldn’t even curtain Armand’s funds, the younger du Lacs having always come into their financial personal inheritances at seventeen unlike other noble families that made them either work or rely on an allowance until they take up the mantle of Lordship.Armand du Lac – a much more affable wizard than his stuck-in-the-past father – took his certificate and medallion/seal of Office with the elegantly predatory air of a trained professional fighter that even Sirius Black would envy.A handsome and muscled wizard in his early fifties, Armand wasn’t yet even approaching middle-age and had not a single fleck of grey in his chestnut hair and only the slightest of wrinkles in the corners of his deep-blue eyes.“To the Office of High Magister.”  Hadrian continued.  “We Confirm the Lord of the Utmost Ancient and Noble House of Ollivander: Lord Garrick Alysious Ollivander.”With his shock of white hair and eerie light blue eyes, Ollivander brought a dash of true eccentricity to the formal group on the Privy dais.As well as the wisdom that came with true age.  Barring Ollivander, none of the other Privy Councilors had seen a century.  A sharp change from other Privy Councils that generally are filled with grey-beards, not vital wizards in the prime of their lives.“We have also created a new Office among the Privy Council.”  With that Hadrian shocked a group that at this point considered themselves unshakeable considering the Death Eater, convict, goblin, squib, and werewolf he’d appointed to some of the highest posts in the Wizarding World.  “That of Ambassador to the Mundane: the Honorable Mycroft Siger Holmes.”Mycroft took his place among his father and uncle with due solemnity.The occupants of Snowdon Castle took a breath as one.  There would be no more additions – controversial or otherwise – to the Privy Council.  Each and every chair on the Council dais had been filled.A door to the right of the dais opened and a parade of Ladies came out, crossing the front of the Hall and each taking her seat on the dais to the right of Hadrian.“Alongside Our Council there are a few other appointments that must be made in accordance with tradition and law.”  Hadrian took a breath as he banished the table before him with a wave and held out his left arm, cuff flashing in the candle light.  “We give you Our Chatelaines.”Each Lady stood as her name was called, though some puzzled over the handful of chairs that stood empty at the front of their dais.Working in order from furthest-flung area to the Head herself, Hadrian introduced them:“Chatelaine for the Royal Retreats: Lady Narcissa Malfoy nee Black.”  Once again he barreled on ignoring the mutters from the crowd.  “Chatelaine for India: Lady Pari Patil nee Answari.  Chatelaine for Russia: Lady Gita Valimar nee Prakenskii.  Chatelaine for France: Lady Sabine Delacour nee du Lac.  Chatelaine for Ireland: Lady Mary Rose O’Connor nee Shaunessey.  Chatelaine for Wales: Lady Margeaux Holmes nee Hawkins.  Chatelaine for Scotland: Lady Sara McLaggen nee Abbott.  Chatelaine for England: Lady Narcissa Malfoy nee Black.”More rumbles over the “Death-Eater’s wife” being given such heavy responsibility and honor.  Rumbles squashed by the last announcement.“Head Chatelaine for the Empire of Avalon: The venerable Dowager Lady Augusta Longbottom nee Prewett.”Hadrian continued once the dragon-lady had retaken her seat.“Last but certainly not least in Our mind: the members of the Royal Household.”  Each man – or woman – made their way forward and took their seat before the Chatelaines when called.  “The Royal Steward: Tristan Bolyn.  The Royal Secretary: Russel Davies.  The Royal Healer: Lady Andromeda Tonks nee Black.  The Royal Mind Healer,” rumble-rumble-new post-rumble.  “Healer Tedric Tonks.  Royal Potions Master: Lord Severus Snape-Prince.  And finally the Captain of the Royal Guard: HitWizard Durstram McGonagall.  We give you, the Royal Appointments!”Applause rang through the Hall – though it was grudging in some places – and the Council, Chatelaines, and Household all rose and took another bow.“Let Our Lordship Ball Begin!”At that pre-arranged signal banquet tables appeared all throughout the Hall and everyone was gently prompted towards their seats through use of house-elf magic.  Those seated upon the daises were released to mix and mingle according to the prearranged charts and another small table appeared before the two at the center of it all.  Wills quickly followed Hadrian’s example and spoke his order to the mithril chargers before tucking into his Beef Wellington, mash, and seasonal vegetables.After a mostly-pleasant dinner where the guests chose between Beef Wellington, lobster turbot, or duck l’orange, the house-elves made the remains of the dinner and appetizers which included truffle-stuffed prawns, foie gras, oysters, and caviar with full accompaniment, the canny creatures set up long and heavily-laden buffets with a wide range of fruits, cheeses, and sweet desserts including various regional specialties.  As the diners rose and the music began, most of the dinner tables vanished leaving only a ring of tables around the edges of the Great Hall as well as a selection of seating for conversation purposes in the same.The only chairs to be found in the Grand Ballroom were occupied by the Milan Wizarding Orchestra.As Hadrian and Wills finished their sweets – a strawberry-topped chocolate-ganache tarte for Hadrian and treacle tart for Wills – the sound of a bow gliding along the strings of a violin summoned the newly-introduced King and his Betrothed.Casting quick cleansing and breath freshening spells, the Royal pair obeyed what was no less than a summons and rose, gliding elegantly to the very center of the Grand Ballroom.It was time to open the dance.And what a dance it was.Gliding elegantly around the floor – Hadrian and Wills with Hadrian leading as both King and extremely-tall eleven-year-old – they showed every ounce of both their breeding and training as the Orchestra played the hauntingly lovely waltz from Swan Lake.Rumors and whispers abounded as they turned, twirled, and glided as they’d practiced, Hadrian using every ounce of his newly-gained strength from the Claiming ritual to maneuver Wills as elegantly as possible and show him off to best advantage.The new King was proud to have the Lord of House Nimue as his first Consort and he wasn’t scared to show it.When the music bled into another waltz, this time from the ballet Sleeping Beauty, Hadrian and Wills gave each other a grin as they were joined on the floor.  Wills smoothly traded Hadrian off to Octavian for his turn with their betrothed and the young Windsor himself took his Rian’s cousin Dora for a spin – though he guarded his toes.  Lovely Dora was, graceful she was not.Wills kept a sharp ear out and picked up a whisper here and there.“…lovely couple…”“…disgraceful, infamous Blacks…”“Is that the Prince Heir?”“…damned muggles…”“…thirteen consorts.  Do you suppose…?”Waltz turned into a lively country dance and Hadrian once again was swept into a dance – this time with David Wallace as Tavi and Wills partnered each other – feeding the growing fire.Intentionally feeding at that.  The three of them had already made the decision that they wouldn’t ignore Tavi and Hadrian’s future – and current – relationship.  If the populace reasoned out that Tavi was one of Hadrian’s intendeds, cheers to them.  For the moment the Crown and Royal Family/Household wasn’t going to comment one way or the other.“Have you made a decision?”  David asked lowly, leaning down to whisper in Hadrian’s ear when they came together in the fast dance.“Hmmm.”  Was all Hadrian would say before spinning off again.After taking another turn with Wills, this time a minuet, both of them sat out the following spritely jig though they cheered on Sirius and Gawain who were locked in a battle of footwork, going so far as to summon and lay down a pair of greatswords that they could truly give justice to the tradition.Deadly implements dismissed, Hadrian whirled Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth away into a gentle waltz with much less fanfare than he’d used with the lady’s grandson.  While Rian was occupied, Wills went ‘round with his mum.  Bowing and giving the grand dame a kiss to her hand with a roguish wink, Hadrian turned her over to her grandson before whisking Lady Maggie into the next set.While Hadrian did rounds with all of the important ladies in his life – including his Chatelaines and the wives of his new Councilors and Household members – he also spied both Wills and Tavi being pressed into a dance with David.  Clever git.  His two future consorts also dance with one another several times while their future husband was “doing the pretty” and proving that yes, he could be politic even on the dance floor – a genuine concern of Mycroft’s.It was directly following Hadrian finishing up with the last of his “required” dances that he was approached.He’d moved to one of the buffet tables and was mostly concealed in the shadows, sipping thirstily at his sparkling cider and nibbling a petit-four, when the two ambassadors found him almost in sync.Siger and Sherrinford appeared – as if by magic, which thinking about it, it probably was – just as the dignified gentleman in the stunning montsuki hakama in black with his family Crest over his heart while the silk-draped lady with her golden bangles and black wig waited politely, ceding her right of precedence to the Japanese Ambassador as he did reach the young King’s side first.“Princess-High Priestess Hatshepsut, Lord Oshiro,” Sherrinford greeted the two highly-placed (and highly born) dignitaries with all due proprieties.  “May I introduce His Grace, Hadrian, King of the Empire of Avalon?”Siger hissed in Hadrian’s ear in an almost silent aside: “She’s the second-born child and oldest sibling of the sitting Pharaoh and High Priestess of Isis; he’s the first-cousin of Emperor Hiro.  Not ordinary ambassadors nor the regular representatives of either throne at all.”Fan-fucking-tastic.  Hadrian thought to himself sarcastically.  As if being put on display wasn’t enough and dealing with politicians great and small wasn’t bad enough, now he ran the risk of alienating obviously-valued members of his two closest allies.What was supposed to be just a ball was turning into a minefield.And yes, he knew what that was.  His mundane history lessons had been very comprehensive.Unfortunately, he wasn’t prepared for this meeting.  Not yet.  All indications had signified that he wouldn’t need to actually meet with the royal families of either the Ptolemy or Rising Sun empires for more than a year.  And everything the normal ambassadors had mentioned had backed that up.For Hecate’s sake, he’d only been studying each of their native languages for less than a year, he couldn’t even risk greeting them properly without risking giving offense with his accent or pronunciation.“Your Grace,” the stately sultry-eyed matron of (Hadrian’s best guess) approximately middle age, stepped forward in an elegant glide, offering a languid hand.Dressed in draping silks in the green and copper of her Royal House, the powerful and cunning High Priestess was a vision from a bygone time from her horsehair wig to her spider-silk raiment and scarab (the sigil and sacred animal of her House) golden bangles wrapped around her upper arms.  Her gold-and-copper collar was stamped with the Ptolemy Crest: the Crook & Flail crossed above a Scarab, and her nails were tinted a venomous green.  It all played very well against her black eyes and gold-dusted skin that belied her true age.After all, Pharaoh Rameses Caesar Ptolemy the Fifteenth was over a hundred years old and was a mere eleven months older than his Priestess sister, one of only two siblings: the High Priestess and the “spare heir” and High Priest of Ra Ahmose who shared the same set of parents, their joint mother having been rendered barren by Ahmose’s strenuous birth though they have over two dozen half-siblings from their father’s various concubines.Pharaoh Rameses himself has had four wives, two of which have died while the other two an Italian noblewoman in her seventies and a Japanese niece of the Rising Sun Emperor who had only turned thirty this year – quite the scandalous match considering their eldest child was fifteen and precipitated his parents’ hasty wedding.Things were still…tense to say the least between the Ptolemy and Rising Sun patriarchs.Which made having the Pharaoh’s High Priestess sister and the Emperor’s Lord of a first cousin standing next to each other a potential crisis.Thank Loki for Sherrinford and Siger.“High Priestess Ptolemy,” Hadrian smiled genially and gave her a bow only slightly less formal than that he would give her ruler brother.  “It is a pleasure to meet you.”“The pleasure is mine I assure you, young King.”  Hatshepsut’s silken voice was nearly sibilant it was such a rich alto.  “All the Priests and Priestesses of Egypt have offered sacrifices and offerings in celebration and thanksgiving over your ascension.  After all,” she glance towards the patiently waiting Lord Oshiro.  “When one ally rises we all rise.”The Japanese Lord quirked a brow at the play on his Royal House’s name and motto. Hadrian thanked the powerful lady then turned politely towards the nearly-as-powerful Lord.“Your Grace.”  Oshiro’s voice was rich with his native language.  “Much as Egypt has given thanks and celebration, as has the magical people of the Rising Sun.  All of Japan and our territories look forward to a return to the fast friendship and alliance we have enjoyed in the past with Avalon.”“Avalon also looks forward to that day,” Hadrian bowed a faction less formally still.  “With all our allies and past friendships.”  He added, lightly warning the two that he had no intention of playing favorites between the two squabbling empires.  “Priestess, Lord Oshiro, are you both familiar with the newly appointed Lord High Ambassador of Avalon, my former mentor and guardian Lord Siger Holmes?”…Hadrian, as was quickly becoming habit, collapsed face down into the thick comforter in his personal quarters in Skye Palace.He and other important members of the Council, Household, and Wills’s family, had all returned to the Palace immediately after he closed the Ball with a final waltz between himself and his bonded.McG had warned, and all had agreed, that remaining in Snowdon any longer was an unnecessary risk when Hadrian could easily create port-keys between the two places if any dignitaries stayed on in the ancient Emrys seat – which several including the Lady Hatshepsut and Lord Oshiro had.Wills chuckled from the doorway as he watched his bonded attempt to kick off his basilisk-hide boots without turning over, getting up, or unlacing them.“You know you’re going to have to beard both of those dragons tomorrow right?”  Wills arched a brow as Hadrian gave a knowing groan.The two royal ambassadors had already put Hadrian and by extension Siger, Sherrinford, and Mycroft, through the wringer – and that was with a carefully watching audience.There was no telling how bad the meeting Tristan had set for the next morning would be with each of them.“Are you trying to smother yourself with the pillow?!”",The Avalon Seven,108617

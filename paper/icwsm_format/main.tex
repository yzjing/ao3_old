\title{Does Novelty Disturb and Repel? Linguistic features and the Success of Fanfictions in Fandoms}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Finding out what people enjoy is crucial for the creative industry. Researches suggested that successful cultural products balance novelty and conventionality: they provide something comfortable, with a little surprise. Using a large dataset of a specific type of cultural products --- fanfictions, we study the relationships between the recognition and the novelty of a fanfiction. We quantify the novelty of a fanfiction using a term-based language model as well as a topic model, in the context of existing fanfictions in the fandom. We found that both high word-level novelty and high topic-level novelty are associated with poorer recognition among readers, diverging from the traditional theory of hedonic values of novelty.
\end{abstract}

\noindent 
What do people like? This is the central puzzle for the creative industry, a multi-billion dollar sector that produces mumerous cultural products in the form of movies, TV shows, video games, etc \cite{creativeindustries}. On one hand, novelty is central to creative works, not only because \emph{creative} works are novel by definition, but also because people seek surprise when consuming creative works \cite{hutter2011infinite}. But on the other hand, studies have shown that people also have a strong preference for familiarity. For example, when people listen to music, they often choose songs that they are familiar with \cite{thompson2014shazam}. A mere exposure to a certain stimuli can increase people's preference for it \cite{zajonc1968attitudinal}, even when they are not aware of the exposure \cite{kunst1980affective}. The exposure effect is assumed to have an evolutionary basis, and has been verified by multiple experiments \cite{bornstein1989exposure}.

Leveraging the familiarity effect is therefore a core strategy to achieve popularity. Repetition has long been utilized in cultural products including music and poetry \cite{huron2013psychological}. This trend can be also found in the contemporary popular culture, where many new releases are adaptations, remakes, and remixes of existing works \cite{manovich2007comes}. For example, Marvel and DC Comics have been making movies based on their popular comics, including many sequels, prequels, reboots, and soft reboots, many of which produced massive successes. In an extreme case, the same origin story of the Spider-man has been re-played in three movies since 2002: \emph{Spider-Man (2002)}, \emph{The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)} and \emph{Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)} \cite{spiderman}. Market reception indicates that the audience enjoy such repetitions: these three movies grossed \$636,480,300, \$308,489,900, and \$342,750,600 after inflation-adjustment respectively \cite{spider-gross}, being among the top 300 highest-grossing movies of all time. Out of the 10 highest-grossing movies of 2016, 8 are adaptions, sequels, remakes, or parts of a movie universe \cite{2016film}. This number increased to 10 out of 10 in 2017 \cite{2017film}. 

As a reconciliation for the apparent conflict between the preference for novelty and familiarity, the \emph{optimal differentiation hypothesis} \cite{thompson2017hit} has been widely adopted. It states that successful creative works are combinations of convention and innovation; the most popular ones are differentiated from previous works and their peers, but not \emph{too} different. In psychology, this is captured in the Wundt-Berlyne curve, an inverted U-shaped curve with an optimal amount of novelty for hedonic values \cite{berlyne1970novelty}. Experiments have supported this hypothesis \cite{hargreaves1984effects} \cite{sluckin1980liking}, which has been used to study the success of a variety of cultural products. For example, Askin and Mauskapf found that songs with optimal differentiation are more likely to be on the top of the Billboad's Hot 100 charts \cite{askin2017makes}. Sreenivasan found a similar pattern for films \cite{sreenivasan2013quantitative}, and Mukherjee et al. found that in scientific publications, the highest-cited papers are grounded on mostly conventional, but partly novel combinations of previous works. 

However, most of these researches study cultural products whose reception are influenced by many factors. These include intrinsic factors such as subject, genre, and length, and external ones including price, advertisement, and media coverage. For example, deliberately putting unpopular songs on the top chart can in fact popularize them \cite{salganik2008leading}. The complex interactions between consumers, cultural products and the market is therefore difficult to disentangle. 
 
Here, we instead study a special type of creative works --- fan works, which are directly created and consumed by fans. Formally known as ``transformative works'', they are creative works made by fans based on one or more ``canons'' \cite{wiki:transf_work}. For example, a fan of Sherlock Holmes may write a story about Holmes in his retirement. Although fan works can take multiple media types such as painting, music, and games, the most common type is creative writing: fanfictions. As a unique cultural phenomena, fanfictions have drawn attention from media studies and cultural studies \cite{thomas2011fanfiction}. However, most of the existing studies focus on the identity of fanfiction writers \cite{black2006language}, the practice of fanfiction writing \cite{LIT:LIT12061}, and the interaction between fans \cite{hills2015expertise}, rather than fanfictions themselves as creative works.

We use fanfictions to study the relationships between novelty and enjoyment. Using fanfictions allow us to avoid some of the aforementioned complications. Because fanfictions are usually not published as books nor featured in mainstream media, but shared among relatively isolated online communities (``fandoms'') with almost no advertisement or promotions \cite{wiki:fandom}, the success of a fanfiction is less swayed by the social spreading processes. Additionally, most fanfictions are freely available in the Internet, so that the price is not a confounding factor. Moreover, fanfictions in the same fandom are created using the same context, sharing similar subjects, characters, and settings. The variations between them are therefore much less than between general fictions, allowing us to focus on their novelty while controlling for other factors. Finally, because they are freely available as plain texts without the copyright issues, natural language processing methods can be readily applicable to operationalize novelty quantitatively.

With these advantages, we investigate how a fanfiction's novelty is associated with its success. We use two frameworks to estimate the novelty of the fanfictions:  term based language model and topic modeling. In both cases, a fiction is evaluated with respect to existing fanfictions in the same fandom. A fanfiction is more novel if it is further from the other fanfictions published during the same time period in the feature space. Using statistical models, we found a monotonic negative relationship between a fanfiction's novelty and its success. Our finding diverges from the optimal differentiation hypothesis, suggesting that in the context of fanfictions, novelty is discouraged in general and readers prefer creative works that give them a sense of familiarity. 


\section{Results} 
We collect data from an online fanfiction archive, Archive of Our Own (AO3), which allows users to upload their fanfictions and categorizes them based on fandoms. Established in 2009, it has become one of the largest fan communities, with 1,313,000 users and 3,423,000 pieces of fanfictions by November 2017 \cite{ao3stats}.

AO3 classifies the fandoms based on formats, such as movies, TV shows, books, anime \& manga, and musicals. We first identyfy the top 5 fandoms in each category based on the number of fanfictions. Then we exclude the fandoms that are subsets of other large fandoms. For example, we keep \emph{Marvel} but exclude \emph{The Avengers}, because \emph{The Avengers} is a part of the Marvel universe. Fandoms that cover diverse topics such as \emph{k-pop} are also removed. We only kept the fictions written in English. Finally, to control for the effects of fiction length on the readers' preference and on our methods, we only analyze the fictions with 500 - 1500 words in each chapter, which is the range where most fictions lie in. This leaves us with 701,635 fanfictions in 24 fandoms. 


\subsection*{Descriptive statistics}

Figure \ref{fig:fandom_size} (a) shows the number of fanfictions in each of the 24 fandoms that we study. The fandoms with the largest amounts of fictions are \emph{Marvel}, \emph{Supernatural}, and \emph{Sherlock Holmes}. Figure \ref{fig:fandom_size} (b) shows the time series of the fanfictions' volume. As AO3 was established in December 2009, the fictions earlier than this time might be migrated from other platforms, and may not correctly reflect the status of the archive. We therefore only run our analysis using the fictions published in January 2010 or later. After its establishment, the site first experienced a slow growth until around 2012, when the number of fictions published begin to rise rapidly.

We also collected metadata for each fanficiton (see Table \ref{tab:metadata}). The success of a fanfiction can be measured by kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks. While kudos is the most direct indication, being a straightforward expression that a reader liked the fiction, the hits is also an indicator of popularity. A reader may choose to bookmark a fanfiction to read later. This may depend on multiple motivations, such as the length of the fiction and the time when the reader browses the website; we also do not know if the reader returns to read the fiction later. The number of comments shows the engagement of readers with a fanfiction, and is indirectly associated with popularity. Based on these considerations, we choose to use kudos as the primary indicators of success, and hits, comments and bookmarks as secondary indicators. Figure \ref{fig:kudos_dist} shows the cumulative distribution of these indicators on a logarithmic scale. Like many other measurements of popularity, they follow fat-tailed distributions. That is, a small number of fictions receive the majority of kudos, etc, while most fictions receive little or none. 

To isolate the relationships between the novelty and success, we need to control for other confounding factors. For example, some fandoms have larger fan bases than others, resulting in higher numbers of kudos for the fanfictions in these fandoms. The popular authors' fame may influence how their works are received. Since AO3's user base has been increasing, we may expect newer fanfictions to receive more kudos than older ones. Multi-chapter fanfictions may also be likely to receive more kudos than single-chapter ones. The ``Archive Warnings'' indicate that the fanfictions contain sensitive elements such as graphic violence or major character death, and may influence the readers' choice to read them. Other intrinsic features, such as the ratings of the fictions and the relationships in them may also influence the readers' preferences. In subsequent analysis, we use multiple strategies to control for such influences.


\subsection*{Fanfictions' Novelty and Success}
As previous studies noted \cite{askin2017makes} \cite{de2015game}, it is reasonable to assess a fanfiction's novelty in the context of other previously published fanfictions. Intuitively, a fanfiction is less novel if it is similar to many other fictions published before. Therefore, we locate the center of the feature space containing all past fictions in respect of a fanfiction. If a fanfiction is close to the center, it is less novel, and vice versa.

We extract features from the fanfictions using two methods, the term frequency-inversed document frequency (TF-IDF) and the \emph{Latent Dirichlet Allocation} (LDA) \cite{blei2003latent}. TF-IDF is a vector space model often used in information retrieval \cite{turney2010frequency}, where each fanfiction is represented as a vector, its entries being scores of the unique words in the fiction. This allows us to identify the most representative terms in the documents, quantifying the term-level novelty. The TF-IDF scores are computed, for each fanfiction, using all fanfictions published in the same fandom within the past 6 months from when it was published. We then compute the center of the feature space as the average of all feature vectors. The \emph{term novelty} score $s$ of a fanfiction is defined as:

\begin{equation}
s = 1-\frac{f\cdot{c_f}}{\lvert f \rvert \lvert c_f \rvert}
\end{equation}

where $f$ is the vector representation of a fanfiction and $c_f$ is the center of the vector space defined for this fanfiction.

We also use the LDA to quantify the fanfictions' novelty with respect to their topics. LDA models a document as a probabilistic distribution over a set of topics, each of which is a probability distribution across terms. Similar to the TFIDF method, for each fanfiction we construct a feature space consisting of the topic distributions of the fanfictions published before it, and define the \emph{topic novelty} score as the cosine distance between the fanfiction's topic distribution and the center of the feature space. 

Figure \ref{fig:tfidf_lda_kudos} displays the raw correlation between the fanfictions' novelty and the kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks that they receive, aggregated across fandoms. Since the fandoms differ in size and activity, we compute the z-score for each value based on the average of its fandom. We observe that as the term novelty and topic novelty score increases, the z-score of kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks decrease in general in both cases, with the exception of a few small fluctuations. The less novel fanfictions generally receive better-than-average recognition, and vice versa. This result prompts us to perform more sophisticated analysis with proper control of confounding factors.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
          \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/scatter_all}
        \caption{The relationships between novelty and success, measured by kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks. The horizontal axes are the novelty scores, and the vertical axes are the corresponding average of the z-score of kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks in bins with bin size = 0.1. The confidence intervals obtained from bootstrap resampling are shown. }
        \label{fig:tfidf_lda_kudos}
\end{figure*}


We perform several regression analysis to further explore this relationship. Four models are created with response variables being the logarithm of kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks respectively, and the term novelty and topic novelty scores being the predictor variables in all models. Control variables are added to account for the influence of other factors on the reception of fanfictions. First, the number of chapters that a fanfiction has is included, considering that multi-chapter fictions have more chances of exposure and that higher kudos may stimulate writing of more chapters. Secondly, categorical variables are created to capture the effects of the fandoms, archive warnings, categories, and ratings. Thirdly, the authors may accumulate fame by writing fanfictions, and such fame may bias readership and kudos. We therefore use a binary variable \emph{frequent author} to indicate whether an author has written more than 10 fanfictions. Fourthly, the relationship between characters is one of the main reasons that fans read fanfictions, and some relationships have a larger fan base than others. To account for this effect, we create another binary variable \emph{frequent relationship} to capture whether a fanfiction features a relationship that is among the top 5 most frequent relationships in the fandom. Finally, we include the age of each fanfiction as a numerical variable, which is the number of days since a fanfiction was last edited. The correlations between the numerical variables are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corr}, showing no strong correlation between the predictor variables.

Because of the excessive zeroes in the response variables, we apply a Heckman--style correction with two steps. A Logistic regression is first performed on the predictor and control variables to predict the probability of each sample having a non-zero outcome. This probability is then used as an additional predictor variable in a pooled OLS regression for each model.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
          \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/variables_corr.pdf}
        \caption{Correlations between the predictor and outcome variables. Strong collinearity exists between the outcome variables, but not the predictor variables. }
        \label{fig:corr}
\end{figure}

Selected OLS coefficient estimates of each model are summarized in Table \ref{tab:regression} (for the full coefficients table, see Supplementary materials). We notice that a fanfiction featuring frequent relationships and published in certain fandoms are likely to have better reception. Meanwhile, elements such as character death and mature contents are not beneficial to their reception. In contrast to our assumption, the number of chapters, the author's fame, and the age do not have significant influence on the fanfictions' success. After controlling for these effects, we find that the term novelty and topic novelty both have significant negative coefficient estimates. This further supports our previous observation that higher novelty contributes to a fanfiction's receiving less kudos, hits, comments, and bookmarks. As the reception of a fanfiction is shaped by many factors including possible noise, we consider the signals found with this model to be a strong indication.

Although we find an overall negative relation between novelty and success, this do not rule out the possibility of non-linear relationships, such as the reversed U-shape curve. We therefore turn to generalized additive models (GAM) \cite{wood2006generalized} for non-parametric estimation. The same set of predictor variables, control variables and response variables are used, except for that we use the original values of response variables instead of their logarithms. The fitted plots with kudos as response variable for term novelty and topic novelty are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gam}. We observe an overall monotonic decrease in both cases, except for a small increase in the high topic novelty region.

\section*{Discussion}
Traditional theories about pop culture suggest that people like things with a large degree of familiarity and a little surprise. Our findings with fanfictions diverge from this pattern: people like no surprise and will always stay to the familiar. This may be the nature of fan works --- because fans desire to see familiar characters and stories, it is reasonable for them to prefer fanfictions with familiar elements. This may extend to other parts of pop culture, explaining people's desire to listening to old songs and justifying the abundance of sequel and spin-off works. However, it does not account for the emergence of novelty. Sometimes, non-stereotypical creative works enjoy great success: if people do not show a preference for innovation, they can only be attributed to a few highly innovative artists.

We have developed a method to quantify the novelty of writings by comparing its linguistic features to other writings. We also measure novelty on two levels: the word level and the topic level. Although we choose to focus on fanfictions, our method can be easily extended to other types of creative writings. A potential research direction is therefore to investigate the relationship between novelty and success in other areas, such as book markets or news articles. 



\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data collection}
A Python script was used to obtain data from AO3 (http://archiveofourown.org/) as csv files in March 2016. We filtered the data based on the language and length of the fanfictions, and replaced missing values where possible. Several extreme values are also removed as they are likely to be outliers.

\subsection*{Modeling fanfictions}
The Python library scikit-learn was used to create the vector space models. Another library Gensim is used to fit LDA topic models on our data. We set the number of topics to 100 and use default values for other parameters. 

\subsection*{Regression analysis}
We use the Python library statsmodels \cite{seabold2010statsmodels} to perform the pooled OLS regression. The GAM models are fitted using the pyGAM library \cite{pygam}, with parameters $splines=25$ and $lambda=301.25$.

  In particular, the consumers' choices are largely shaped by the herding behavior. For example, it was found that being on the New York Times bestseller book list will cause an increase in sales \cite{sorensen2007bestseller}.  Even a ``faked'' popularity can be turned into real popularity as people are more likely to view creative works that they perceive to be popular \cite{salganik2008leading}. Therefore, such metrics may not accurately reflect the consumers' actual enjoyment of a cultural product. Moreover, as the features of cultural products vary significantly across genres, lengths, subjects, etc, it is hard to measure the novelty or conventionality of one piece against the others.

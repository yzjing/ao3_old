My project uses text mining techniques to look at how people in fandoms read fanfictions. Traditionally, it is believed that popular creative works strike a balance between novelty and familiarity; however, our results found that with fanfictions, people mostly prefer familiar works than novel works, suggesting that as transformative works, fanfictions may be evaluated differently with original works.
